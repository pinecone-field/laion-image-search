The legislation passed in the then-Democratically controlled House in June 2020. But it stalled in the Senate. Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee reintroduced the bill on Thursday, days before the fourth anniversary of Floyd\u2019s murder.\u00a0It calls for law enforcement to be held\u00a0\u201caccountable for misconduct in court,\u201d and police training and policy reforms. \u201cWe have the opportunity to enact bold, comprehensive reform to policing practices, to correct and prevent unnecessary deaths. Congress must pass the George Floyd #JusticeInPolicingAct of 2024,\u201d\u00a0Rep. Jackson Lee wrote in a\u00a0Facebook post. Philonise Floyd agreed. \u201cIn their mind they (police) are looking at you as a target just because you\u2019re somebody of color,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, if they can make federal laws to protect the bird, which is the bald eagle, then they can make federal laws to protect people of color.\u201d George Floyd,\u00a0a 46-year-old Black man, was killed on May 25, 2020, while in police custody. Derek Chauvin, a White police officer, was\u00a0filmed\u00a0kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck and back for\u00a0nearly\u00a0nine minutes\u00a0as Floyd pleaded for help and said he couldn\u2019t breathe. The following year, Chauvin was\u00a0convicted\u00a0of murder and manslaughter in a state trial and sentenced to\u00a0more than 22 years\u00a0in prison. He later\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in federal court of depriving Floyd of his civil rights. Three other former Minneapolis police officers also faced state and federal charges and were sentenced to prison time for their role in Floyd\u2019s murder. Speaking at Thursday\u2019s press conference,\u00a0Democratic Rep. Ilhan\u00a0Omar, who represents Minneapolis,\u00a0called on her fellow lawmakers to\u00a0\u201cthink of the lives that could have been spared if we had the courage to act.\u201d \u201cWe need a clear national standard to uphold the promise of equal protection under the law,\u201d she said. George\u00a0Floyd\u2019s murder sparked a wave of protests against racial injustice and police brutality around the world.\u00a0Four years later, Floyd\u2019s death still feels raw to his family, who were inclined to joined the ranks of Black Americans spurred to action after their loved ones were killed by police. \u201cI promised myself as I\u2019m watching that video (of his death) that I got to do something. And I have not stopped doing something,\u201d\u00a0Floyd\u2019s uncle\u00a0Selwyn Jones told CNN. This spring,\u00a0Jones\u00a0joined Gwen Carr,\u00a0the mother of\u00a0Eric Garner,\u00a0an unarmed Black man who was also killed by police in 2014, to talk about how they\u2019ve turned their pain into purposeful activism at Harvard University.

{"id": "2024_05_25_politics_donald-trump-libertarian-party-rfk", "text": "Former President Donald Trump will address the Libertarian Party\u2019s convention Saturday, an unconventional stop for a presumptive Republican nominee but also illustrative of his campaign\u2019s intensifying concern over third-party candidates. Trump is expected to deliver a pitch to Libertarians focused on their shared grievances over President Joe Biden\u2019s four years in Washington, an event organizer told CNN. His team has also closely watched the results of an informal poll that asked convention attendees which topics Trump should touch on during his remarks. The outreach to Libertarians follows weeks of stepped-up attacks by Trump aimed at Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose high-profile independent White House bid is increasingly viewed by the former president\u2019s advisers as a potential problem in an election expected to be decided by a narrow margin in a handful of states. Kennedy addressed the convention Friday as the two directly compete for voters disenchanted by the two-party system. In a speech last weekend to the National Rifle Association, Trump described Kennedy\u2019s political views as \u201cradical left\u201d and warned his supporters, \u201cWe can\u2019t waste any more votes.\u201d In a candid moment, Trump also shared the purpose behind his unusual visit to the Libertarian Party. \u201cWe have to join with (Libertarians) because they get their 3% every year, no matter who\u2019s running,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand we have to get that 3% because we can\u2019t take a chance on Joe Biden winning.\u201d Eight years ago, Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson earned more than 3% of the popular vote \u2013 a high point in the party\u2019s history. The number of votes Johnson, Green Party nominee Jill Stein and other third-party contenders earned was larger than Trump\u2019s margin of victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in a handful of closely contested battlegrounds. While Trump\u2019s campaign has downplayed Kennedy\u2019s potential to alter the outcome of the race \u2013\u00a0one adviser called him \u201ca problem, not a threat\u201d \u2013 it is not a risk the former president\u2019s team is willing to write off either. Johnson, a former GOP governor of New Mexico, told CNN that any third-party concerns by Trump or Biden would be misguided. \u201cIf there were no third-party candidates, 50% of their vote would go to Biden, 50% would go to Trump,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd a bunch would stay home.\u201d An unusual invitation and a PR boon The decision to host Trump and Kennedy has brought outsize media attention to the Libertarian Party at a time when it has struggled to maintain its relevance. Four years after Johnson\u2019s historic finish, the party\u2019s candidate earned fewer than 2 million votes and wasn\u2019t a factor in Biden\u2019s victory. Convention organizers believe Trump\u2019s speech marks the first time in the modern political era that a presumptive Republican or Democratic nominee will speak at a third-party convention. Trump appeared eager for the audience. His campaign accepted the invite within 48 hours of the offer, said Angela McArdle, chairwoman of the Libertarian Party. Biden was also asked to speak but didn\u2019t respond. Kennedy has challenged Trump to debate him at the convention, a request that has gone unanswered. \u201cI\u2019ve come pretty close to having a major presidential debate at our national convention,\u201d McArdle said. \u201cThat\u2019s the purpose. If we don\u2019t get to be in a debate, we\u2019re going to get as close as possible. \u201cWe don\u2019t get the coverage Donald Trump and Joe Biden get. It\u2019s an uphill battle. So this has been a real PR boost.\u201d Still, McArdle and other Libertarian members are skeptical that convention attendees can be seriously moved by Trump\u2019s overtures. \u201cThese are people who spent thousands of dollars and devoted hundreds of hours to be here in support of their Libertarian candidates,\u201d McArdle said. \u201cNo one is worried about them flipping.\u201d Wendy Hamlin traveled from St. Augustine, Florida, to attend the Washington, DC, convention. The 43-year-old joined the Libertarian Party in 2008, and while she said Trump\u2019s appearance marks a \u201chistorical moment\u201d for the party, neither she nor any Libertarian she knows is planning to back him. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to see him speak,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone excited to see him because they plan to vote for him.\u201d The test for Trump is not necessarily to convert die-hard Libertarians. Rather, his team hopes to convince independent-minded voters who are considering a third-party candidate out of dissatisfaction with the Democratic and Republican nominees or to push back against the status quo. Phil Anderson, a Libertarian running for Senate in the closely watched battleground of Wisconsin, said he\u2019s seen no evidence of the Trump campaign reaching out to Libertarian-leaning voters in his state. \u201cIt\u2019s not happening in Wisconsin because I know all the Libertarians here in one way or another,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing or hearing evidence of that.\u201d Trump spokesman Brian Hughes said the campaign has \u201calready demonstrated effective and solid organizational strength as seen in the historic quickness and size of our primary wins and the historic polling numbers in the general.\u201d \u201cWe are reaching out to Libertarians, Republicans, independents and everyone in between,\u201d Hughes said. Trump is waging a similar \u2013 and more urgent \u2013 battle to convert Kennedy-curious voters. Kennedy\u2019s support in national surveys has reached double digits \u2013 at 16% in a CNN poll conducted last month by SSRS \u2013 with strong indications that he is siphoning support from both Trump and Biden. As the threat has crystalized, so have Trump\u2019s attacks on Kennedy. The former president now regularly attacks Kennedy in public remarks and on social media. Earlier this month, Trump released a lengthy video that labeled Kennedy a \u201cDemocrat plant.\u201d Trump last weekend touched on some kinship between Libertarians and Republicans that could make for a sensible alliance. Libertarians align with conservatives \u2013 at least on paper \u2013 over a desire for a more limited federal government, lower taxes and less spending but often disagree with Republicans on LGBTQ rights and marijuana policy. \u201cThey are also people of common sense, generally speaking,\u201d Trump said, though he added that Libertarians \u201chave a couple of things that are a little different.\u201d Johnson doesn\u2019t see much overlap between his party and modern Republicans, including Trump. He cited the massive growth in the national debt and government spending under Trump and the Covid-19 lockdown measures of 2020. \u201cBottom line, I didn\u2019t vote for Ronald Reagan the second time because he just blew the lid off the deficit. And that\u2019s Trump,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThere are going to be some things that he has says that the crowd will be receptive to, but there are a lot of things that just don\u2019t fit.\u201d Indeed, there\u2019s little overlap between Trump\u2019s agenda and the topics convention attendees indicated are a priority in the party\u2019s poll. The top choices included elimination of the federal income tax, ending the Federal Reserve and freeing WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The poll is not scientific but was open only to convention attendees and party members who paid\u00a0$10 to participate. The Trump campaign is aware the former president may receive an unfriendly reception from some attendees Saturday night but is arguing such a reaction is a byproduct of being \u201con offense and competing for nontraditional votes.\u201d Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller told CNN, \u201cDo we know that it\u2019s not exactly home base? Absolutely. There will be people who want him to be there and people who don\u2019t want him to be there, but we\u2019re on offense and competing for nontraditional votes in order to unite the country.\u201d Trump ally and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy was loudly booed Friday when he mentioned Trump during his speech to the convention. The reaction suggests when Trump takes the stage Saturday night, he will be speaking to a crowd far different from the kind he is used to addressing at his rallies, which are full of adoring fans who wait in line for hours to see him D\u2019Anne Welch, 73, has supported Libertarians since 1990, but she\u2019s worried about the party\u2019s embrace of Trump. She\u2019s considering voting for Biden to keep Trump from winning in November. She and her friends, a group of like-minded Libertarians from Texas, brought noisemakers to Washington in hopes of disrupting Trump\u2019s remarks. \u201cHe never should\u2019ve been invited,\u201d Welch said. Competition for Libertarian votes Trump is not alone in courting potential Libertarian voters. Though Kennedy has ruled out the possibility of running on the Libertarian ticket, he has courted party officials dating to before he left the Democratic primary last fall to run as an independent. He met with McArdle in July in Tennessee, where the two discussed shared beliefs, including opposition to vaccine mandates and public health restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic. Kennedy and McArdle met again privately following his appearance at the California Libertarian Party\u2019s state convention in February. The Libertarian ticket was seen as a possible pathway for Kennedy to circumvent ballot access hurdles and take advantage of the party\u2019s access to ballots in dozens of states. Kennedy is on the ballot in six states so far, compared with 38 states for the Libertarians. In his remarks at the California convention, Kennedy argued for the benefits of environmental protection while railing against social media censorship and the \u201ctotalitarian control\u201d exerted by government during the Covid-19 pandemic. He did not mention Trump by name. Yet his appearance at the California convention did little to help him gain traction with party members. In an unofficial straw poll of 95 delegates taken at the convention, Kennedy received just one vote. In April, he told ABC News he had ruled out running on the Libertarian ticket. In recent weeks, Kennedy has ramped up his attacks on Trump, including on his handling of the pandemic. Last weekend, Kennedy\u2019s campaign began selling shirts on its website that read \u201cVote Trump/Fauci 2024\u201d along with the slogan \u201cGive us another shot!,\u201d a tongue-in-cheek swipe at Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s prominent role in the Trump administration\u2019s Covid-19 response. Kennedy, a staunch anti-war advocate who has said he opposes sending US aid to assist Ukraine\u2019s war effort, has also accused Trump of backing additional aid to Ukraine. \u201c(Trump) gave a big bear hug to Speaker (Mike) Johnson and President Biden and they agreed to send $64 billion more over to Ukraine. Wouldn\u2019t you rather that 64 billion be spent here in the United States?\u201d Kennedy told supporters during a rally in Austin, Texas, earlier this month. Following a campaign rally in Colorado on Sunday, Kennedy told CNN he thinks Libertarians will agree with his views on the environment, foreign policy and Covid-19. \u201cI think a lot of my philosophy and my approach, particularly environmental issues over the many years, my approach is a free-market approach, which appeals to Libertarians,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m against war, which I think is another important issue for Libertarians. I support constitutional rights. President Trump dismantled our constitutional rights during Covid. So I think Libertarians are probably more inclined to support me if they follow their philosophies.\u201d During his remarks at the convention on Friday, Kennedy issued sharp criticisms of Trump and Biden, but put particular focus on attacking Trump, who he blamed for enacting public health restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cWith the lockdowns, the mask mandates, the travel restrictions, President Trump presided over the greatest restriction on individual liberties this country has ever known,\u201d Kennedy said. Marcus Schuff, a 42-year-old from Temecula, California, said he\u2019s likely going to vote Libertarian in 2024, depending on who wins the presidential nomination this weekend. But if not, he said he\u2019d be most likely to support Kennedy over any other candidate, including Trump. He doesn\u2019t approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic or his foreign policy record. \u201cThe way Trump behaved during the Covid lockdowns, you know, he shut down international trade. He didn\u2019t do anything to keep things open when certain governors of certain states were shutting things down. And his foreign policy wasn\u2019t great either. I don\u2019t think we should be assassinating Iranian generals in Iraq,\u201d Schuff said, referring to the 2020 drone strike ordered by Trump that killed top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t think many Libertarians are going to be swayed by Trump,\u201d he added.

The flag was no longer displayed when the reporter, Robert Barnes, visited the justice\u2019s house in Alexandria, Virginia, on the day of President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration to follow up on a related tip, the report said. Martha-Ann Alito demanded the reporter\u00a0\u201cget\u00a0off my property\u201d as he came across the couple leaving their home, The Post said. According to The Post, Martha-Ann Alito yelled,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0an international signal of distress!\u201d as Barnes sought information on the matter before the justice led his wife to a car while denying the flag was related to political protest and saying it stemmed from a neighborhood dispute. Martha-Ann Alito then shouted: \u201cAsk them what they did!\u201d in apparent reference to the Alitos\u2019 neighbors, before retrieving a novelty flag from the couple\u2019s home and yelling,\u00a0\u201cThere!\u00a0Is that better?\u201d after placing it on the flagpole, according to The Post. A spokeswoman for The Post said in the article that the newspaper didn\u2019t report on the interaction at the time\u00a0\u201cbecause\u00a0the flag-raising appeared to be the work of Martha-Ann Alito, rather than the justice, and connected to a dispute with her neighbors\u201d and that it was unclear it was rooted in politics. The Post\u2019s reporting comes as the conservative justice has become embroiled in controversy over displays outside his properties. The New York Times last week\u00a0published a photograph\u00a0of the inverted American flag raised at the Alitos\u2019 home in Virginia in 2021. Alito said the upside-down US flag\u00a0was raised by his wife and was a response to a spat with neighbors. The dispute involved a neighbor who posted a sign saying\u00a0\u201cF**k\u00a0Trump\u201d near a school bus stop and then a sign attacking his wife, Alito said. The justice\u00a0told Fox News the Alitos got into an argument with the neighbor, who used the term\u00a0\u201cc**t\u201d\u00a0at one point. His wife then flew the inverted flag. The upside-down flag was a symbol for former President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters who falsely claimed widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. The Times then reported Wednesday that a flag that was on display during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol was seen flying outside the Alitos\u2019 vacation home in New Jersey last summer.\u00a0The\u00a0\u201cAppeal\u00a0to Heaven\u201d flag, which dates to the Revolutionary War, has become a symbol for supporters of Trump. The revelations about the flags have drawn criticism in Washington, including from\u00a0key GOP senators and from Democrats, who have called on the justice to recuse himself from cases involving Trump and the 2021 attack on the Capitol. Senate Republican Whip John Thune, one of the contenders vying to replace retiring Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, told CNN the flag was a \u201cbad decision.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how you explain that,\u201d the South Dakota Republican said. The news has also reenergized calls on the left for Congress to enact ethics rules for the Supreme Court, an effort has been stalled for months. Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, who has been a frequent critic of conservative justices, told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan on Thursday that it\u00a0\u201craises\u00a0a serious question\u201d for someone on the nation\u2019s highest court to fly such flags at his properties. Some Republican lawmakers have defended Alito, with Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas telling CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on Wednesday that the\u00a0\u201centire\u00a0hoopla is greatly overstated\u201d and accusing Senate Democrats of trying to delegitimize the court.

Last\u00a0summer, blockbusters \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d\u00a0combined added nearly a billion dollars to the domestic box office, according to Comscore data. But this year, studios are betting on a large slate of mid-range sequels and prequels, as well as family-focused animated films to fill the Barbenheimer-shaped hole, including \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga,\u201d \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2.\u201d Coupled with production delays \u2014 the aftershocks of the multi-month-long Writers Guild and SAG-AFTRA strikes that are still reverberating across studios \u2014 the season that has historically drawn the biggest movie theater audiences is off to a rocky start, potentially hurting the yearly box office totals for 2024. \u201cSummer is the most important moviegoing season of the year, accounting on average for nearly 40% of the total domestic annual revenue, so as goes the summer so goes the year,\u201d Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, told CNN. \u201cBarring some major overperformances, this summer looks like it\u2019ll be down 20% to 25% in box office grosses between May and August from last year,\u201d said analyst Shawn Robbins, founder and owner of Box Office Theory. The elusive $100-million opening weekend Until 2020, the period between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day Monday could be counted on to bring in upwards of $4 billion in domestic revenue, according to Comscore data. Summer 2023 saw the first post-pandemic $4-billion summer. Propelled by the success of \u201cSound of Freedom,\u201d \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d and the record-breaking $155 million \u201cBarbie\u201d opening weekend, summer 2023 grossed $4.09 billion, a 19.2% jump from the year prior. \u201cBarbie\u201d was distributed by Warner Bros., which is owned by CNN\u2019s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery. An opening weekend north of $100 million is typically only seen in intellectual property-driven action films like Star Wars movies and superhero flicks, as well as animated family fare like \u201cThe Incredibles 2\u201d and \u201cFinding Dory.\u201d So far this year, no movie has crossed that threshold. \u201cSans a Marvel movie to provide a $100-million-plus opening weekend to get the momentum going, this summer will have to make up ground in June and July,\u201d said Dergarabedian, adding that this summer has so far been a \u201clate bloomer.\u201d Disney offerings could make or break the summer box office Two movies that analysts say could cross the $100 million threshold this summer are \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d both of which are distributed by Walt Disney Studios. The studio\u2019s first wide release of 2024 under its flagship \u201cDisney\u201d banner is set to be \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d an anomaly for the company and the movie business, according to Daniel Loria, editorial director at Box Office Pro, which collects sales and showtimes data from thousands of movie theaters across the United States. (Disney-owned 20th Century Entertainment released its first movie of the year, \u201cThe First Omen,\u201d in April.) \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other year where a studio as vital to this industry sits out the entire first half of the year,\u201d Loria told CNN, adding that this is in large part due to production delays and schedule shifts caused by months of back and forth between studios, the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, the actors\u2019 union. \u201cWe tend to overemphasize the effect of Hollywood\u2019s 2023 labor strikes at the box office, but it\u2019s hard not to cite it when you look at the number of releases to have hit theaters from major studios in the first half of the year.\u201d Disney has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Loria also emphasized that Disney\u2019s summer offerings, both from its Pixar and Marvel divisions, will be critical to how the 2024 box office performs overall. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d is forecast to open anywhere between $80 million and $100 million, according to Box Office Pro pre-sales data. Pixar\u2019s offerings in recent years have fallen flat; 2022\u2019s \u201cLightyear\u201d debuted at $50.5 million domestically, while 2023\u2019s \u201cElemental\u201d made $29.6 million its opening weekend. Meanwhile, \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d the only Marvel property release this summer, is expected to reinvigorate audience enthusiasm after \u201cThe Marvels\u201d disappointed last November with a $47 million opening weekend. Last week, ticket seller Fandango announced that \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d had broken the company\u2019s 2024 record for best first-day ticket presales, beating out \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d The film also had the best first day of ticket sales for an R-rated film in Fandango\u2019s 24-year history, the company told CNN. \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine has the potential to be the second movie (after 2021\u2019s \u201cSpiderman: No Way Home\u201d) to earn a $200 million opening weekend of the post-pandemic era,\u201d said Loria. \u201cWe are still two months out, but if pre-sales and awareness continue at this pace, we believe the film can open between $170 million and $210 million.\u201d \u201cDespicable Me 4\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2\u201d \u201clook particularly strong, and \u2018Deadpool & Wolverine\u2019 will hands down be the top film of the summer,\u201d said Dergarabedian. Studios still trying to find their footing Industry experts agree that the 2024 box office has been sluggish so far, but remain hopeful that the box office can rebound by the end of the year and beyond. \u201cBox office earnings have been down largely because of staggered gaps between widely appealing releases in the first half of the year,\u201d said Robbins. \u201cThat\u2019s been the status quo in the post-pandemic era for many reasons, mostly outside the control of theatrical exhibition. The industry had only a brief period between the impact of COVID production delays followed by the writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strikes last year.\u201d Robbins added that there\u2019s still time for strong titles in the second half of the year to fill the gap, including September\u2019s \u201cBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\u201d and \u201cTransformers One,\u201d and October\u2019s \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.\u201d \u201cMoviegoing habits have changed drastically since the\u00a0pandemic, but we continue to see significant enthusiasm when it comes to the theatrical experience,\u201d said Loria. \u201cThe data clearly shows that audiences can still support the studio tentpole model \u2014 but identifying the movies that will become those blockbuster hits continues to be as difficult to predict as ever before.\u201d Box Office Pro projects that the 2024 box office will gross $8.2 billion, about 10% lower than last year\u2019s $9 billion. The domestic earnings for 2023 were the highest since the pandemic, but still fell roughly $2 billion short of pre-pandemic yearly sales, according to Comscore.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/business/summer-2024-box-office-earnings-forecast/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "us"}}

In a statement, Schwarzman said, \u201cThe dramatic rise of antisemitism has led me to focus on the consequences of upcoming elections with greater urgency. I share the concern of most Americans that our economic, immigration and foreign policies are taking the country in the wrong direction. For these reasons, I am planning to vote for change and support Donald Trump for President. In addition, I will be supporting Republican Senate candidates and other Republicans up and down the ticket.\u201d The move represents a decided shift for Schwarzman, the CEO of the private equity firm Blackstone, who made comments critical of Trump in the wake of the 2020 election and suggested in 2022 that the Republican Party needed to seek a \u201cnew generation\u201d of leaders. But that new crop of leaders did not materialize. Schwarzman declined to back Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in May 2023 after a meeting with the Republican presidential hopeful left Schwarzman uninspired. Schwarzman supported Trump in the 2016 election and became a trusted adviser once Trump took office. The private equity mogul chaired a prominent business advisory council that weighed in on economic and trade issues and projected a public image of support from corporate America. But the group disbanded after Trump said that a violent Charlottesville white nationalist rally had good people \u201con both sides.\u201d \u201cBigotry, hatred and extremism are an affront to core American values and have no place in this country,\u201d Schwarzman said at the time. Other top executives at Blackstone, which manages $1 trillion, have backed Democrats. Jon Gray, the firm\u2019s chief operating officer, supported Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020.

{"id": "2024_05_23_us_tennessee-medicaid-free-diapers", "text": "Tennessee\u2019s Medicaid program will in a few months provide free diapers for covered children under the age of 2 \u2013 the first state Medicaid program to do so, the program said Tuesday.  On Friday, the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services approved an amendment to Tennessee\u2019s Medicaid waiver, TennCare III, according to a\u00a0news release\u00a0from TennCare. The amendment will allow TennCare to cover the cost of up to 100 diapers a month for children under the age of 2 who are enrolled in TennCare or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (known in the state as CoverKids), starting in August. \u201cThese new initiatives will ease financial burdens for families and ensure the well-being of TennCare\u2019s youngest members,\u201d the release said. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recently approved a\u00a0similar Medicaid program in Delaware\u00a0that will provide up to 80 diapers per week and up to one pack of baby wipes to parents for the first 12 weeks after giving birth. Other state Medicaid programs may cover diapers for older children when it is deemed medically necessary for incontinence issues. TennCare already covers diapers and other incontinence products for people with \u201cillnesses or conditions that impact their ability to control their bladder or bowels,\u201d according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Under TennCare\u2019s new program for infants and 1-year-olds, parents and legal guardians can collect diapers directly through participating pharmacies in TennCare\u2019s network. That will help in \u201cpreventing avoidable health care use and improving overall infant health,\u201d according to the federal agency. \u201cA key benefit to adequate diaper supply is preventing diaper dermatitis, otherwise known as diaper rash, and urinary tract infections,\u201d the federal agency said. A study from the National Diaper Bank Network found that 47% of families reported diaper need in 2023, a jump from the approximately 33% who reported it in 2010. Infants require up to 12 diapers per day, at a cost of $80 to $100 or more per month per baby, according to the network. Diapers can cost 8% of a person\u2019s total income if they are making federal minimum wage, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The National Diaper Bank Network, an advocacy group, says more states can ease the burden on new parents by removing sales taxes on diapers. Those taxes are charged on diapers in 26 states, the network says. Some states recently added themselves to the list of those that have no sales taxes on diapers, providing some relief for families as recent spikes in inflation have made diapers even more expensive. Another way to address diaper need is through investing in diaper banks, which 10 states do and four others did previously, the network says. A few states, namely California,\u00a0New York and\u00a0Washington, provide assistance to families to help make diapers more affordable, according to the network.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/us/tennessee-medicaid-free-diapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_business_nissan-suv-driveway-explosion", "text": "In the early morning of May 14, Vicki Hill was startled awake by the sound of explosions outside her home in Bethesda, Maryland. The loud bangs, she learned later, had come from the airbags of the family\u2019s SUV, a 2015 Nissan Murano that was parked in the driveway. It was on fire. \u201cI thought someone was trying to get into our house with a sledgehammer and I woke my husband up and I said something\u2019s wrong,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAnd he ran downstairs and shouted up, \u2018Call 911, the car\u2019s on fire!\u2019\u201d Video from the home\u2019s doorbell camera,\u00a0which the family provided to CNN,\u00a0shows smoke before the fire erupts and then\u00a0engulfs the car. The cause of the fire in the Murano remains unknown. The fire is\u00a0under investigation\u00a0by Nissan. The National Highway Traffic Administration is gathering information\u00a0on the fire, as well. \u201cThe safety and security of our customers is our primary concern,\u201d a Nissan spokesperson said in a statement in response to an email asking about the fire. \u201cWe have opened an investigation into this incident.\u201d The\u00a0Hills\u2019 Murano was recalled by Nissan\u00a0in 2016 and 2019, to fix a problem that could allow brake fluid to leak and start a fire, even while the vehicle is parked. At the time, owners were warned to park their vehicles outside and away from buildings until the issue was repaired because of fire risks. A search on NHTSA\u2019s website indicated there was an outstanding unrepaired recall on the Hills\u2019 Murano. The couple said a local fire investigator suggested the unrepaired recall could have caused the fire. But the Hills remember getting the work done and provided CNN with a photograph of the receipt from a local Nissan dealership that showed the repair was made. CNN has not confirmed whether the receipt is authentic. The Hills said that because the recall work had been done, the possibility of a fire wasn\u2019t something that crossed their minds. Philip Hill had been fixing the garage, so the couple\u2019s two cars were parked in the driveway. Otherwise, the Murano would have been parked inside the garage adjoining the house. \u201cAs you can see from the video, that vehicle is so close to the house,\u201d Philip Hill told CNN. \u201cMinutes later, the house could have gone up.\u201d As it was, the garage door melted from the flames, they said. The Hills credit a neighbor\u2019s dog with saving them and their three children. The neighbor was able to call 911 before the Hills, after being alerted by her dog. The intense flames from the burning Nissan also damaged the side of the family\u2019s other car, a 2012 Mercedes C-class, leaving it unusable. Initially, the Hills were concerned they might have been victims of vandalism. But\u00a0they said\u00a0the video footage from their Nest doorbell camera\u00a0clearly\u00a0showed the vehicle spontaneously combusting. Nissan took possession of the Murano on Wednesday to study it more closely, the Hills said. As surprising as the Hills\u2019 situation may seem, vehicle fires are not uncommon. In 2022, an estimated 188,500 car and truck fires blazed in the United States, an average of more than 500 a day, according to the National Fire Protection Association. Vehicle fires caused 610 civilian deaths that year, according the NFPA.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/business/nissan-suv-driveway-explosion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_us_ethan-crumbleys-parents-refuse-help-appeal", "text": "A Michigan judge on Wednesday denied Ethan Crumbley\u2019s request for his parents\u2019 pre-sentence investigation reports to help him appeal his life without parole sentence. Ethan was sentenced in December after pleading guilty to gunning down four classmates and wounding six others and a teacher at Michigan\u2019s Oxford High School in 2021. He was 15 at the time. His parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, were each sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison earlier this year following manslaughter convictions. As part of the appeal of his sentence, Ethan asked a state court for the confidential pre-sentence reports used in the trial of his parents, arguing his family and home environment are relevant to his appeal. On Wednesday, Oakland County Circuit Judge Cheryl Matthews sided with the parents and denied the request for the pre-sentence reports, according to Ashley Williams, a member of Matthews\u2019 legal staff. The sentencing court was required to consider his family background, including his home environment, because he was under the age of 18 at the time of the offenses, Ethan\u2019s attorneys wrote in a motion earlier this month. In response, prosecutors did not take a position on the matter and noted the parents\u2019 pre-sentence reports were not created until months after Ethan was sentenced. Alona Sharon, an attorney for Ethan\u2019s father, wrote in response to the motion that Ethan is \u201cable bodied\u201d and \u201ccapable of advising his counsel about his childhood, his parents and his home environment. Counsel has failed to explain to this Honorable Court why they cannot learn this evidence from Ethan directly.\u201d An attorney for Ethan\u2019s mother wrote in a court filing that the documents are \u201cprivileged and confidential\u201d and she had \u201cnot waived her statutory privilege allowing the disclosure of her pre-sentence report.\u201d Jennifer Crumbley\u2019s attorney wrote that in a bid to show that her son\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective, Ethan \u201cis simply attempting to engage in a fishing expedition for information that (he) hopes will prove helpful.\u201d Her attorney wrote Ethan should be able to provide his attorney with any information about his \u201cfamily and home environment\u201d that may be relevant under the law. The Crumbleys are the first parents to be held criminally responsible for a mass school shooting committed by their children\u00a0as the nation continues to grapple with\u00a0the scourge of gunfire on campuses. Attorneys for Ethan and his parents did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. Ethan was sentenced last year after pleading guilty to\u00a0terrorism\u00a0causing death, four counts of murder and 19 other related charges. He\u00a0did not testify in his parents\u2019 trials. Ethan admitted in court that on November 30, 2021, he took a gun from an unlocked container in his home, hid it in his backpack and took it out in a bathroom before opening fire on his schoolmates. He killed Madisyn Baldwin, 17; Justin Shilling, 17; Hana St. Juliana, 14; and Tate Myre, 16. At the parents\u2019 trials, prosecutors used testimony from shooting survivors, police investigators and school employees to show James and Jennifer Crumbley were \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d in allowing their teenage son to have access to the gun and ignoring signs of his spiraling mental health. In pre-sentence investigation reports included in the prosecution\u2019s sentencing memos, the parents continued to defend their actions. \u201cI am wrongly accused, and now wrongly convicted of Involuntary Manslaughter. My actions were that of any other parent,\u201d James Crumbley wrote. He also said he \u201chad no knowledge of what (my son) was going to do, or presented with ANY warning signs,\u201d and he defended his gun safety efforts. \u201cI followed the law and took gun safety to the point as needed.\u201d In her report, Jennifer Crumbley sought to clarify her testimony, saying she would not have done anything differently. \u201cWith the information I have now, of course my answer would be hugely different. There are so many things that I would change if I could go back in time,\u201d she said. \u201cI never imagined he would hurt other people in the way that he did.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/us/ethan-crumbleys-parents-refuse-help-appeal/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "us"}}

The monument\u00a0in Tyrrell County, North Carolina, features a Confederate soldier on top of a pedestal with the inscription \u201cIn appreciation of our faithful slaves\u201d written underneath. The lawsuit, filed in the Eastern District of North Carolina, was brought by\u00a0a group called\u00a0The Concerned Citizens of Tyrrell County. The plaintiffs\u00a0claim the public monument is in violation of\u00a0the\u00a0Equal\u00a0Protection\u00a0Clause of the 14th\u00a0Amendment\u00a0because it \u201cexpresses a racially discriminatory message.\u201d The inscription on the statue promotes a \u201cpro-slavery message\u00a0and a pro-Confederate\u00a0message,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Jaelyn Miller, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told CNN she feels county commissioners have a responsibility to ensure that racist messages are not being displayed to the Black community. \u201cThis is sort of the only monument in the country on public land that textually\u00a0endorses slavery,\u201d Miller said. Ian Mance, another attorney for the plaintiffs, said the historical record is clear that the monument was meant to send a message. \u201cIt was put up in the front yard of what was soon to be the\u00a0Tyrrell\u00a0County Courthouse, which opened a few months later, to communicate to people that members of the Black community could not expect to get justice inside of that courthouse,\u201d he said. The lawsuit alleges the construction of the monument and the county\u2019s continued maintenance \u201ccommunicates, on behalf of local government, the idea that Tyrrell\u2019s institutions regard Black people\u2019s rightful place as one of subservience and obedience\u201d and that \u201cBlack people who were enslaved in Tyrrell County preferred their slavery to freedom.\u201d The lawsuit also claims that the county\u2019s display of the message has \u201cincite(d) racial hostility\u201d and endangers the plaintiffs\u2019 safety. The monument has been standing since 1902 and\u00a0the lawsuit\u00a0is the latest move in a decades-long battle to have it removed\u00a0from courthouse grounds. Mance said\u00a0the\u00a0plaintiffs have been attending commission meetings since the 1990s and holding demonstrations since 2019. \u201cLitigation was our last resort,\u201d Sherryreed\u00a0Robinson, one of the plaintiffs said in a\u00a0news release announcing the suit.\u00a0\u201cWe have peacefully voiced our objections for years.

{"id": "2024_05_25_us_harrison-butker-speech-response", "text": "In his first public comments following a controversial speech at a recent college commencement, Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker defended his address and emphasized his Catholic faith. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t clear that the timeless Catholic values are hated by many, it is now,\u201d Butker said during a speech at the \u201cCourage Under Fire\u201d gala in Nashville on Friday night. The Nashville speech was\u00a0posted to X by right-wing media outlet The Daily Wire. This is the first time the three-time Super Bowl champion\u00a0has spoken publicly about his commencement address at Benedictine College, a small Catholic college in Kansas, on May 11. During his address, Butker made comments interpreted by many as homophobic and sexist, including calling Pride Month a \u201cdeadly sin\u201d and saying that a woman\u2019s accomplishments in the home are more valuable than any academic or professional goals, among other things. Friday night\u2019s gala was hosted by\u00a0Regina Caeli Academy \u2013 a hybrid campus/homeschool Catholic school group with several locations across the country. The gala boasted several other speakers including right-wing media personality and host at the Daily Wire, Matt Walsh. \u201cOver the past few days, my beliefs, or what people think I believe, have been the focus of countless discussions around the globe,\u201d Butker, who is on the school\u2019s\u00a0board of directors, said. Regina Caeli Academy\u00a0did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. \u201cAt the outset, many people expressed a shocking level of hate. But as the days went on, even those who disagreed with my viewpoints shared their support for my freedom of religion,\u201d Butker said Friday. Butker reaffirmed his commitment to his Catholic faith, saying, \u201cOur love for Jesus and thus our desire to speak out should never be outweighed by the longing of our fallen nature to be loved by the world.\u201d During his speech, Butker referred to Saint Daniel, the biblical prophet who was thrown into a lion\u2019s den for committing to prayer to God, despite a law that condemned worshipers to death. \u201cI can\u2019t help but tremble at the thought of the courage many saints have shown in their lives,\u201d Butker said. Daniel was spared by God due to his commitment to faith, according to the Old Testament. \u201cWould I be so bold if the repercussion was what Daniel faced in being fed to lions? In reality, any courage I\u2019ve shown will lead to some small suffering. And it will lead to some people maybe never liking me, but that could be God\u2019s will,\u201d the Chiefs kicker said. The NFL issued a statement earlier this month, saying Butker\u2019s comments don\u2019t reflect the views of the league. Butker\u2019s May 11 speech sparked criticism from LGBT advocacy organization GLAAD, which called his comments \u201ca clear miss\u201d and \u201cwoefully out of step with Americans about Pride, LGBTQ people and women.\u201d The sisters of Mount St. Scholastica monastery, a\u00a0founding institution\u00a0and sponsor of Benedictine College, also distanced themselves from Butker\u2019s message. \u201cThe sisters of Mount St. Scholastica do not believe that Harrison Butker\u2019s comments in his 2024 Benedictine College commencement address represent the Catholic, Benedictine, liberal arts college that our founders envisioned and in which we have been so invested,\u201d they said\u00a0in a statement. \u201cInstead of promoting unity in our church, our nation, and the world, his comments seem to have fostered division.\u201d Fellow Chiefs star, Travis Kelce, recently responded to the commencement address, saying\u00a0he does not agree with \u201cjust about any\u201d of Butker\u2019s views but values him as a teammate. \u201cI cherish him as a teammate. I think Pat (Mahomes) said it best where he is every bit of a great person and a great teammate,\u201d\u00a0Kelce said on the latest episode of the \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast he hosts with his brother, Jason.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/us/harrison-butker-speech-response/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_us_norfolk-southern-settlement-ohio-train-derailment", "text": "The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Justice have reached a $310 million settlement agreement with Norfolk Southern after last year\u2019s train derailment that spilled more than a million pounds of hazardous chemicals into the soil, water and air in Ohio. \u201cIf the settlement is approved by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Norfolk Southern will be required to take measures to improve rail safety, pay for health monitoring and mental health services for the surrounding communities, fund long-term environmental monitoring, pay a $15 million civil penalty, and take other actions to protect nearby waterways and drinking water resources,\u201d the EPA said Thursday. The\u00a0February 2023\u00a0derailment ignited a dayslong inferno, spewed poisonous fumes into the air,\u00a0killed thousands of fish\u00a0and left residents wondering if it\u2019s safe to live in East Palestine. In the weeks following the disaster, officials said tests showed the air quality and municipal water were safe. But some residents reported a variety of health problems after the derailment, including rashes, nausea, bloody noses and trouble breathing. Thursday\u2019s announcement stems from a civil lawsuit filed in March 2023. The DOJ sued Norfolk Southern on behalf of the EPA, alleging violations of the Clean Water Act from the discharge of pollutants and hazardous materials into waters. Norfolk Southern issued a statement Thursday saying it has reached an agreement with the DOJ, the EPA and the US Department of the Interior \u201cto resolve all their claims and investigations arising from the derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.\u201d The agreement, which is subject to court approval, \u201cbuilds on the significant financial commitments that the company has already made,\u201d Norfolk Southern said. In fact, Norfolk Southern said the costs associated with the agreement \u201chave either been previously estimated \u2026 or are included as part of the company\u2019s ongoing financial outlook.\u201d When asked whether the $15 million civil penalty is enough, EPA Administrator Michael Regan told reporters Norfolk Southern is \u201cgoing above and beyond and actually doing things they had not planned to do,\u201d and \u201cso I think it is a strong step forward.\u201d What Norfolk Southern must do Under the settlement, the EPA said, Norfolk Southern has agreed to: \u2022 Spend an estimated $235 million for past and future costs to help ensure the company \u2013 not taxpayers \u2013 is on the hook for all cleanup costs \u2022 Pay a $15 million civil penalty to resolve the alleged violations of the Clean Water Act \u2022 Pay $25 million for a 20-year community health program that includes medical monitoring for qualified individuals, mental health services for those living in affected counties as well as first responders who worked at the site, and a community facilitation plan to help community members in using the benefits of the program \u2022 Spend about $15 million to implement long-term monitoring of groundwater and surface water for a period of 10 years \u2022 Pay $15 million for a private drinking water monitoring fund that will continue the existing private drinking water well monitoring program for 10 years \u2022 Implement a \u201cwaterways remediation plan,\u201d with an estimated budget of $6 million, for projects in Leslie Run and Sulphur Run that will prioritize addressing historical pollution, reduce non-point source pollution through infrastructure upgrades and stormwater management projects, and restore aquatic and riparian habitat \u2022 Pay $175,000 for natural resource damages to restore, rehabilitate, replace, or acquire the equivalent of the natural resources injured as a result of the derailment \u2022 Undertake projects to improve the safety of transporting hazardous materials by rail, including the installation of \u201cadditional devices to detect overheated wheel bearings early enough to prevent derailments like the one that happened in East Palestine,\u201d the EPA said. Company reaches $600M agreement for residents In addition to the federal civil lawsuit, Norfolk Southern has reached a tentative, $600 million settlement agreement that would resolve all lawsuits covering thousands of residents within 20 miles of the site of the derailment. The agreement, which needs final approval from a judge, would also resolve personal injury claims within a 10-mile radius from the derailment, Norfolk Southern said last month. \u201cIndividuals and businesses will be able to use compensation from the settlement in any manner they see fit to address potential adverse impacts from the derailment,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis could include healthcare needs and medical monitoring, property restoration and diminution, and compensation for any net business loss.\u201d But the settlement agreement does not \u201cconstitute any admission of liability, wrongdoing, or fault,\u201d Norfolk Southern said. This week, a judge gave preliminary approval for that settlement agreement. Now, lawyers for the plaintiffs will meet residents in the coming weeks to answer questions about the settlement and how residents can submit claims for compensation. Residents and businesses within 20 miles of the derailment should expect to hear from Kroll Settlement Administration, a third party hired to execute the paymentsr. Residents and businesses that want to file a claim must do so by August 22. A hearing for final approval of the settlement is scheduled for September 25. What caused the disaster, and what\u2019s next? The National Transportation Safety Board has been investigating the cause of the derailment and has posted hundreds of pages of reports, interview transcripts and other information related to the probe. So far, the investigation has focused on a failing, flaming wheel bearing. A preliminary NTSB report said sensors detected a wheel bearing heating up miles before it eventually failed and caused the train to derail. But the detectors didn\u2019t alert the crew until it was too late. NTSB board members will return to East Palestine next month to hold a public meeting and vote on the final findings, probable cause and recommendations. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to focus on the immediate wheel bearing issue\u201d at the June 25 meeting, NTSB\u00a0Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told CNN in February. \u201cWe\u2019re going to look at hazmat impacts to the community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make safety-critical recommendations to make sure communities don\u2019t have to live through that again.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_05_24_us_american-missionary-couple-haiti", "text": "Three missionaries, including a married couple from the US, were killed in Haiti\u2019s capital, Port-au-Prince, on\u00a0Thursday evening. Davy and Natalie Lloyd \u201cwere attacked by gangs this evening and were both killed,\u201d\u00a0Natalie Lloyd\u2019s father, Missouri state Rep. Ben Baker, said in a Facebook post. \u201cThey went to Heaven together.\u201d \u201cPlease pray for my family we desperately need strength. And please pray for the Lloyd family as well,\u201d Baker said. Mission director Jude Montis, 45, was also killed. All three worked for Missions in Haiti, Inc., which has been operated by Davy Lloyd\u2019s parents for more than\u00a0two decades, according to\u00a0the group\u2019s website. Davy Lloyd, 23, had a \u201clove for Haiti,\u201d his father David Lloyd told CNN. \u201cHis first language was Creole. He used to tell us when he was little that someday he was going to be a missionary in Haiti.\u201d He and Natalie Lloyd, 21, were ambushed as they left church in Port-au-Prince on Thursday evening, according to David Lloyd. \u201cDavy was taken to the house tied up and beat. The gang then took our trucks and loaded everything up they wanted and left,\u201d a post on Missions in Haiti\u2019s\u00a0Facebook page said. Three hours later, the organization\u00a0posted\u00a0that the three missionaries \u201cwere shot and killed by the gang about 9 o\u2019clock this evening. We all are\u00a0devastated.\u201d It\u2019s still unclear how exactly the missionaries were killed. The investigation into the killings is ongoing, and Haitian police have not yet released any details on them. Local emergency response service Haitian Emergency Response Operations (HERO) assisted in coordinating and managing the operation to retrieve the bodies and transport the remains of the American couple to a hospital morgue. \u201cCurrently, we are working to retrieve the bodies of Natalie and Davy,\u201d Baker said on social media Friday night, adding that the effort will involve obtaining a waiver. \u201cAfter that, we have to find an airline that will be willing to do the transport. Prayers that this will all go smoothly.\u201d He remembered the couple as people who put others before themselves, telling CNN Friday evening that he commends their bravery. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can find a better example of people who truly had a deep love for the people of Haiti and had a vision to help them in anyway that they could and made such an impact there among the different ministries they were involved in,\u201d Baker told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on \u201cThe Source.\u201d \u2018Our last call\u2019 David Lloyd told CNN that he was on the phone with his son during the attacks. The mission and church across the street have two security guards, but when the 23-year-old came out of the church around 6 p.m., \u201cthree pick-up trucks full of guys with guns overwhelmed them immediately,\u201d he said. The armed men dragged Davy Lloyd to the house, tied him up, and started looting the compound, according to his father, who said children from the orphanage were in the compound at the time. After the gang left with its haul, Davy Lloyd called his father. \u201cHe was injured, and he was hurt. He was nervous, and very very scared,\u201d David Lloyd said. \u201cHe was begging me to find someone to get in there and help him, and I did all I could but I couldn\u2019t locate anybody.\u201d Then more armed men arrived, he said. \u201cHe told me, \u2018I have to go down, something else is going down. I gotta go see what it is,\u2019\u201d David Lloyd recalled. \u201cThat was basically our last call.\u201d Around that time, someone shot one of the newly arrived gang members, sparking a violent backlash, he said. \u201cDavy went in and barricaded himself in my personal home with his wife and (mission director) Jude Montis. The gang shot that place up until they got the door busted down and shot them, and set Davy and Jude on fire.\u201d HERO, the ambulance service, confirmed to CNN that Davy Lloyd\u2019s body was found burned at the scene. Haitian police will work with international law enforcement to investigate the killings, police spokesperson Gary Desrosiers told CNN on Friday. \u201cThis is an open investigation but we are sure we will arrest those involved. For now, we\u2019re working on protecting the public and the community while actively searching for the perpetrators,\u201d he said. On Missions in Haiti\u2019s website, Davy Lloyd can be seen talking about growing up in the Caribbean nation and doing manual labor on the mission compound. He previously survived a kidnapping in Port-au-Prince in 2005, when he was just 5 years old, his father said. According to a report that year by the Tulsa World newspaper, Davy Lloyd, his sister and foster sister were abducted in a carjacking on their way home from school. But police were able to locate the kidnappers, rescue the children and quickly return them to their parents, according to the report. \u201cWe got them back 21 hours later,\u201d David Lloyd recalled. \u2018The security situation in Haiti cannot wait\u2019 In a statement to CNN Friday, the White House said it was aware of the reports and expressed condolences while urging for the expedited deployment of UN Security Council-approved international police force to the region. \u201cWe are aware of the reports of the deaths of U.S. citizens in Haiti.\u00a0Our hearts go out to the families of those killed as they experience unimaginable grief,\u201d a national security spokesperson told CNN. \u201cThe security situation in Haiti cannot wait. That is why yesterday, President Biden reiterated our commitment to support the expedited the deployment of the Multinational Security Support (MSS) Mission to bolster the Haitian National Police\u2019s capabilities to protect civilians, restore the rule of law, and pave the way to democratic governance.\u201d Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Parson also mourned the couple\u2019s loss on X Friday morning, calling it \u201cabsolutely heartbreaking news.\u201d Until now, the area around the Missions in Haiti compound had felt largely safe despite the violence in the rest of the city, according to David Lloyd, who was in the country until a few days ago. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really heard any gunshots in any of this. Our school\u2019s been open, the church has been functioning, the bakery\u2019s been selling bread every day,\u201d he said. When flights resumed last week to Port-au-Prince\u2019s Toussaint Louverture International Airport, Lloyd said he asked his son and daughter-in-law if they would like to leave Haiti, but they declined. \u201cWe know Haiti is a very volatile situation, we know that it\u2019s dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we had a good rapport with the groups in our area, and they\u2019d left us alone. But from what I understand this was an outside group that came in initially from about a mile away, that started it all.\u201d Natalie Lloyd\u2019s father told CNN the couple didn\u2019t leave even when they had the opportunity to do so because of the children they were taking care of. \u201cThey made the decision to remain even when it got worse because they felt like if they left, then those kids would have no where to go,\u201d Baker said on \u201cThe Source.\u201d He believes the initial gang attack was just intended as a robbery, with the gangs trying to take what they can before the UN\u2019s Multinational Security Support mission arrives. \u201cWe have a pretty large mission compound, lots of stuff. With the international military force that\u2019s supposed to be coming in any day, I think the gangs are trying to get all they can get because they realize their times may be coming to an end,\u201d he said. In a joint news conference with Kenyan President William Ruto on Thursday, Biden defended the decision not to deploy US troops to Haiti, telling reporters doing so\u00a0could raise \u201call kinds of questions that can be easily misrepresented by what we\u2019re trying to do, and be able to be used by those who disagree with us and against the interests of Haiti and the United States,\u201d while pointing to material support, including equipment and training, the US has already provided to address the crisis. The Facebook feed of\u00a0Missions in Haiti\u00a0has told the story of the increasing dire conditions in the country this year. \u201cThe gangs are still fighting for more control and chaos rules,\u201d the organization\u00a0posted\u00a0April 23. \u201cIt seems the world has turned their backs on Haiti and it is going to be left in complete gang control.\u201d This story and headline have been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_05_23_us_scottie-scheffler-arrest-update-louisville", "text": "Louisville police released two videos Thursday showing some of the arrest of star golfer Scottie Scheffler last week and announced the detective who arrested him was disciplined for not turning on his body-worn camera at the time. One video from a fixed pole camera positioned across the street shows portions of the interaction between Scheffler and police. In the video, a vehicle turns left and an officer wearing reflective gear runs toward the vehicle, which then stops. Police then take the driver out of the car and a group of three people walk across the street. A second video from a police vehicle\u2019s dashcam shows two officers walking with a handcuffed Scheffler. The videos were released a week after Scheffler was arrested, charged with felony assault, released from jail and then made his tee time in a whirlwind few hours at the PGA Championship, one of golf\u2019s four major tournaments. The world no. 1 golfer was attempting to drive to the Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville for the second round of the tournament at about 6 a.m. when he came to the scene of a fatal crash. He allegedly injured a police officer who was directing traffic and was arrested, according to police. Scheffler, 27, a new father with a sterling reputation, was charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer, along with lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, according to Jefferson County court records. After taking a mug shot and warming up in a jail cell, he was released and made it to his tee time at the golf club. He then shot 5-under that day on his way to finishing the tournament in a tie for 8th place. Scheffler described the incident as a \u201cbig misunderstanding\u201d during a \u201cchaotic situation.\u201d After the news conference Thursday, Scheffler\u2019s attorney, Steve Romines, reiterated the golfer still plans to plead not guilty to the charges. \u201cIt won\u2019t impact my case at all. Our position is the same as it was last Friday: Scottie Scheffler didn\u2019t do anything wrong. We\u2019re not interested in settling the case. We will either try it or it\u2019ll be dismissed. It\u2019s very simple,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the evidence that continues to come out just continues to support what Scottie said all along, this was a chaotic situation and a miscommunication and he didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d High-ranking police officials in Louisville have privately voiced concerns a felony charge against Scheffler is excessive, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN. Prosecutors said Thursday they continue to investigate the case. \u201cThe Jefferson County Attorney\u2019s office has continued to receive evidence and has yet to conduct final interviews with investigators regarding the charges filed by LMPD against Mr. Scheffler,\u201d said Josh Abner, a spokesman for the office. \u201cAs we have stated previously, no decisions have been made and our review continues.\u201d Scheffler, meanwhile, teed off for his first round at the Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth, Texas, on Thursday afternoon. Police discipline detective for not activating body-worn camera At a news conference Thursday, Louisville\u2019s mayor and police chief announced an internal investigation of the case led to discipline for the arresting officer, Detective Bryan Gillis. \u201cDetective Gillis should have turned on his body-worn camera, but did not,\u201d Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. \u201cHis failure to do so is a violation of the LMPD policy on uniforms and equipment, subject category body-worn camera.\u201d The police chief said Gillis did not have his body-worn camera \u201coperationally ready\u201d as required. The detective has received \u201ccorrective action,\u201d said the chief, who did not provide specifics about the discipline at the news conference. A Louisville police memo the department subsequently released Thursday said the detective \u201cwas counseled by a member of his command on May 22, 2024, and a performance observation was completed.\u201d The memo was among documents released related to the detective\u2019s failure to activate his body-worn camera. In one, Gillis explained he \u201cnever powered up\u201d the camera and described his own version of what happened. \u201cWhile directing traffic in front of Gate 1 the PGA personnel stopped a bus from entering Gate 1,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI observed a vehicle traveling in the opposing lanes coming at me. I stopped the driver and advised him he could not proceed because of the bus. He demanded to be let in, and proceeded forward against my directions. I was dragged/knocked down by the driver. I then proceeded to arrest the driver.\u201d Neither Mayor Craig Greenberg nor the police chief took questions from the media at Thursday\u2019s news conference. \u201cActivating body-worn cameras is critically important for our police department to have evidence, to maintain community trust, to be transparent,\u201d Greenberg said. Documents obtained by CNN show Gillis has a history of both reprimands and suspensions within the police department. Gillis, who began his service in 2007,\u00a0has received six reprimands throughout his time with Louisville police, a disciplinary history report shows.\u00a0He has also been suspended on five separate occasions. None of Gillis\u2019 prior suspensions involved failing to turn on his body-worn camera. Records also show Gillis has received several commendations during his career, including back-to-back Meritorious Unit Citations in 2019. The detective\u2019s longest suspension at five days stems from a 2012 incident in which\u00a0Gillis allegedly drove an \u201cintoxicated civilian\u201d in his police vehicle while doing \u201cdonuts\u201d in a business parking lot while his emergency lights were illuminated, according to a 2013 LMPD document. More recently, in 2021, Gillis received a written reprimand for pursuing \u201ca vehicle that did not commit a violent felony or wanted on a warrant,\u201d\u00a0documents show. Additionally, Gillis did not tell dispatchers he was engaging in a vehicle pursuit at the time, according to LMPD documents. The year prior, in 2012, he faced a four-day suspension for failing to appear in court on multiple occasions between 2010 and 2011. Documents show Gillis was also found \u201cat fault\u201d for three crashes, for which he received reprimands and mandatory driver\u2019s training. CNN has reached out to the Louisville Police Department for comment and was told \u201cas this matter is before the courts, commenting further on the participants (defendants, witnesses, and victims alike) is not appropriate for us to do.\u201d Gillis did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment Friday. CNN has also reached out to\u00a0the River City Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 614, the union representing LMPD detectives, for comment on Gillis\u2019 past conduct. What we know about the arrest According to a Louisville Metro Police report, Scheffler was trying to drive into the golf course when he was stopped by an officer wearing a full police uniform and a yellow reflective rain jacket. The officer, identified as Gillis, stopped Scheffler and \u201cattempted to give instructions,\u201d the report states. \u201cSubject refused to comply and accelerated forward, dragging Detective Gillis to the ground,\u201d according to the report. The detective suffered pain, swelling and abrasions to his left wrist and knee and was taken to the hospital for further treatment, the report states. His uniform pants, valued at about $80, \u201cwere damaged beyond repair,\u201d the report adds. Romines, Scheffler\u2019s attorney, said the golfer was headed to the course early to prepare to play. \u201cDue to the combination of event traffic and a traffic fatality in the area, it was a very chaotic situation. He was proceeding as directed by another traffic officer and driving a marked player\u2019s vehicle with credentials visible,\u201d Romines said in a statement. \u201cIn the confusion, Scottie is alleged to have disregarded a different officer\u2019s traffic signals resulting in these charges.\u201d Multiple eyewitnesses have said Scheffler \u201cdid not do anything wrong\u201d but drove as directed, according to Romines. \u201cHe stopped immediately upon being directed to and never at any point assaulted any officer with his vehicle,\u201d the statement reads. ESPN\u2019s Jeff Darlington witnessed the encounter and filmed part of it. When Scheffler arrived in a marked player courtesy vehicle, he tried to drive around the crash scene on a median, according to ESPN. Darlington wrote on social media Scheffler \u201ccontinued to drive about 10 to 20 yards toward the entrance\u201d before stopping. \u201cThe police officer attempted to attach himself to Scheffler\u2019s car, and Scheffler then stopped his vehicle at the entrance to Valhalla,\u201d Darlington\u00a0wrote on X. \u201cThe police officer then began to scream at Scheffler to get out of the car. When Scheffler exited the vehicle, the officer shoved Scheffler against the car and immediately placed him in handcuffs.\u201d Police escorted a handcuffed Scheffler into a police vehicle, Darlington\u2019s video shows. \u201cRight now he\u2019s going to jail,\u201d an officer at the scene says in the video. Scheffler\u2019s arraignment was originally scheduled for Tuesday but was delayed to June due to his attorney\u2019s scheduling issue.

{"id": "2024_05_22_us_ms-rachel-gaza-social-media-cec", "text": "In her videos, Ms Rachel\u2019s whimsical voice is like a balm for many unyielding toddlers. \u201cHiiii, heeeello,\u201d she chirps while waving cheerfully in social media clips that feature upbeat nursery rhymes, dances and language lessons for preschool children. But last week, her message to her\u00a0more than\u00a06.5 million combined followers on Instagram and TikTok was anything but. Instead of her usual smiling, clapping and cheering, the popular social media creator, whose full name is Rachel Griffin Accurso, was in tears. \u201cThe bullying is so bad. It\u2019s so bad. But I can handle this,\u201d she said in\u00a0a video\u00a0posted to her accounts last\u00a0Thursday. It showed a closeup of an emotional Accurso in a dark room, wiping her eyes. \u201cThat is who I am. I love my neighbor. I love every child,\u201d she added. \u201cImagining for one second what a mom is going through unable to feed her child or give her child clean water or keep her child safe.\u201d The backlash had started\u00a0four\u00a0days earlier, after Accurso announced a campaign to raise money for children in several war-torn parts of the world, including Gaza.\u00a0She began receiving\u00a0angry comments on her posts, asking why she wasn\u2019t also trying to help victims of Hamas\u2019 deadly October 7 attack on Israel. \u201cYou should be for all children not just the children in gaza. Do you not care what hamas did to all the innocent jewish children october 7th???\u201d\u00a0one Instagram\u00a0comment said. \u201cYou mention the children of Gaza in your video \u2026 how about the children held hostage? Do you care about all children?\u201d another commenter posted on TikTok. In the caption on her tearful May 16 video, Accurso reiterated her concern for all the world\u2019s children. \u201cPalestinian children, Israeli children, children in the US \u2013 Muslim, Jewish, Christian children \u2013 all children, in every country,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. \u201cNot one is excluded.\u201d Her clarification was not enough to quell backlash from commenters who accused her of disregarding the pain of Israeli children. CNN has reached out to Accurso for comment. Between the polarizing Israel-Hamas war and fiery recent protests on US college campuses, some social media influencers have felt pressure to speak up. But the Ms Rachel episode is a reminder that even the most innocuous influencers can\u00a0face pushback\u00a0when they wade into a thorny issue like the Middle East. She raised $50,000 within hours for children affected by war Accurso is an educator who uses videos filled with songs and games to help toddlers and parents navigate the early childhood years. Her series, \u201cSongs for Littles,\u201d features catchy, educational tunes that are popular with both parents and young children. Her videos are a hit with 9.8 million subscribers\u00a0on YouTube, and span a myriad of topics, including learning how to talk and read. She announced her fundraising campaign\u00a0in a video\u00a0posted May 12 to her TikTok and Instagram accounts, offering to make Cameos \u2014 paid personalized video messages that a celebrity can film on request. Accurso said her earnings from the videos will go to Save the Children\u2019s emergency fund for kids affected by war and mentioned Gaza along with Sudan, Ukraine, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \u201cHopefully I can make little ones smile by giving them a personal video and then the money will go to help more children living in unimaginable circumstances,\u201d she said in the video. \u201cChildren should never experience the horrors of war. These are grave violations of their human rights. Children should be protected.\u201d A day later, she posted another message on the horrifying effects of war. \u201cWe should be ashamed of how children around the world are suffering,\u201d she wrote. Cameo requests and money flooded in. Within hours, she\u2019d raised\u00a0$50,000 from 500 requests\u00a0for personal videos, she said. \u201cEvery penny on my end will go to [Save the Children] to help children facing unimaginable circumstances,\u201d she wrote.\u00a0CNN has reached out to Save the Children for comment. Accurso then paused the\u00a0Cameo requests,\u00a0saying she needed time to film the 500 personalized videos before she could accept\u00a0any\u00a0more. Then came the backlash. A few days later, she posted the tearful video, with the comments turned off\u00a0on Instagram. Instead of her trademark pink T-shirt and denim dungarees, she was barely visible in dim lighting and clutching what appeared to be a blanket. She did not go into details about the bullying she said she\u2019s received and has disabled comments on YouTube and\u00a0some\u00a0Instagram posts. She also received supportive messages. \u201cThis is a moral litmus test and you\u2019re on the right side,\u201d one commenter posted on her TikTok. \u201cStay strong.\u201d Another added: \u201cYou are the Mr. Rogers to our babies\u2019 generation. Thank you for using your platform in such an influential way.\u201d Divisive issues can be tricky for social media influencers, expert says Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel on October 7 and took some 250 hostages into Gaza. In response, Israel launched a war on Hamas in Gaza that continues seven months later. More than 14,000 children have been killed in Gaza since the war started in October,\u00a0according to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. About 12,000 more children have been wounded and thousands remain missing, it says. \u201cRafah is a city of children,\u201d UNICEF\u00a0spokesperson James Elder said\u00a0this month, referring to the Palestinian city in southern Gaza. \u201cIf we define safety \u2014 as international humanitarian law says we must \u2014 as freedom from bombardment, as well as access to safe water, sufficient food, shelter and medicine \u2014 then there is nowhere safe on the Gaza Strip to go to.\u201d Accurso is one of a number of\u00a0social media influencers\u00a0who have used their platforms to raise funds as the humanitarian crisis unfolds in Gaza.\u00a0She describes herself as an ambassador for\u00a0Save the Children. Giselle Ugarte, an online performance and personal branding coach, says joining conversations on such a divisive issue can be tricky for a social media influencer like Accurso, whose brand is built around kids. \u201cMs Rachel is someone who is looked at as an educational resource for young children, a neutral force and a safe place, separated from any of the dangers of the outside world,\u201d she said. \u201cParents want to feel that they can step away from the screen and not have to worry about their children consuming content outside of her traditional programming.\u201d Ugarte said she advises influencers to assess whether wading into a polarizing issue aligns with their mission and brand, and to first \u201crecognize the potential backlash, consequences or perhaps even physical dangers.\u201d Accurso\u00a0has\u00a0said she plans to resume\u00a0her Cameo fundraising campaign.\u00a0And she\u2019s back to pleading for help for the children of Gaza. \u201cI saw a picture of two babies in Gaza and their thighs are like this small,\u201d she said in\u00a0a post Tuesday, choking back tears and making a circle with her thumb and forefinger. \u201cWe can\u2019t let children starve. That is not who we are.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/us/ms-rachel-gaza-social-media-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_us_new-england-white-sharks-memorial-day-trnd", "text": "Beachgoers may be flocking to the shorelines this Memorial Day weekend \u2013 but so might white sharks, which have been spotted recently in New England, scientists in Massachusetts have warned. The New England Aquarium in Boston urged the public to be on the lookout for sharks while enjoying the water as the unofficial start of summer gets underway, the non-profit shared in a news release Thursday. The aquarium\u2019s scientists said multiple marine mammals were discovered with shark bites recently off the Massachusetts coast, according to the release. White sharks are drawn to New England\u2019s inshore waters to prey on seals and other marine life through summer and into fall when activity peaks, the aquarium said in a Facebook post, and scientists expect to see a rise in sharks with the rise in warmer temperatures. \u201cAlthough scientists and fishers have not photographed a white shark yet this season, we know that they are here,\u201d New England Aquarium said on Facebook. Aquarium officials added hundreds of seals were recently sighted along area beaches and two white sharks were briefly spotted from an aerial survey off Monomoy Island in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Depending on the time of year, more than 15 shark species live in New England\u2019s waters, the New England Aquarium said. \u201cWe had a white shark eat a seal in front of some whale watchers this time last year,\u201d John Chisholm, an adjunct scientist in the aquarium\u2019s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life, told CNN via email. \u201cMay is when white shark activity typically picks up, so it\u2019s nothing out of the norm,\u201d he said. A fishing charter company reported a minke whale with a shark bite earlier this week off Chatham, Massachusetts, and Chisholm took photos showing a freshly shark-bitten seal in Plymouth, Massachusetts, according to the aquarium. \u201cWith beach weather in the forecast \u2026 this is a good reminder for people to review shark safety guidelines and be shark smart,\u201d Chisholm said in the release. Cape Cod National Seashore officials reported sharks are active in the park waters of each of its beaches, according to the National Park Service. The aquarium reported four confirmed white whale sightings so far this season as of Saturday, according to Chisholm. The New England Aquarium urged people to be aware of sharks swimming in shallow waters, avoiding spots where schools of fish or seals are visible, and remaining close to the shoreline so emergency responders can help if necessary, according to the release. People who spot sharks can report sightings through the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy\u2019s Sharktivity app, according to the conservancy and the aquarium. A 2023 study found a superpopulation size of around 800 white sharks in the Cape Cod area between 2015 and 2018. While the total number of unprovoked shark bites reported globally remains \u201cextremely low,\u201d according to the Florida Museum of Natural History\u2019s International Shark Attack File, unprovoked shark bite deaths rose over the past year with most of the deaths caused by white shark bites. Three of those deaths occurred in Australia and one person was killed in California, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/us/new-england-white-sharks-memorial-day-trnd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "us"}}

Park officials said they received a report on Sunday about \u201ca 35-year-old male visitor from Massachusetts who was seriously injured by a bear in the area of the Signal Mountain Summit Road,\u201d the National Park Service said in a news release Monday. Following an investigation, park officials have determined \u201cthe incident was a surprise encounter with two grizzly bears.\u201d The earlier bear attack occurred in the Canadian Rockies. The man, who was airlifted by helicopter to a nearby ambulance, is in stable condition, according to the park service, and expected to make a full recovery. With news of the attack still fresh, the park has closed both Signal Mountain Summit Road and Signal Mountain Trail to the general public. On Thursday, a grizzly bear was found dead in Elkford, British Columbia, after inflicting \u201csignificant injuries\u201d on a 36-year-old man who used a firearm to defend himself. \u201cOfficers are confident that they located the bear involved in the attack.

{"id": "2024_05_23_us_unc-dei-policy-vote-reaj", "text": "The Board of Governors for the University of North Carolina System  voted Thursday to repeal and replace its existing diversity and inclusion policy that applies to the 17 schools the board oversees. The new policy reverses one that was adopted in 2019 that sought to \u201cfoster an inclusive environment\u201d\u00a0and required each school to submit diversity and inclusion reports to the board of trustees every year. The new policy now requires UNC schools to \u201censure equality of all persons & viewpoints,\u201d and promote \u201cnondiscrimination in employment practices.\u201d It also mandates that all UNC schools comply with a series of amendments passed by the North Carolina General Assembly in the past year that limit what can be discussed or taught about race, racism and sex in government institutions. The policy passed with two board members \u2013 Joel Ford and Sonja Phillips Nichols \u2013 voting no. Both Ford and Nichols are Black. As the meeting convened, dozens of protestors gathered outside to rally against the proposed changes to the DEI policy. Andy Wallace, director of media relations for the UNC system, confirmed to CNN that two people were arrested outside the meeting Thursday morning. Ahead of the vote, board secretary Pearl Burris-Floyd and board member Gene Davis discussed their support for the new policy. Burris-Floyd said she retired from the field of DEI and believes there have been flaws in the way DEI has been taught. \u201cAnd that has hurt the fabric and ability to carry things forward, but it does not mean that we stop,\u201d Burris-Floyd said. The new policy, she said, will \u201cmake that path forward clearer for all people.\u201d Davis acknowledged that DEI has helped marginalized groups feel more welcomed on campus and ensures that schools are reflection of the state\u2019s diversity. Still, Davis said he had concerns. \u201cI have been made aware of things that have been done in the name of DEI that make me uncomfortable and that I believe actually result in our university communities being less welcoming to all,\u201d Davis said. He did not provide examples of the instances that made him \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d Davis said the commitments in the new policy are \u201cheartfelt by the members of this board and by the university leadership.\u201d But some students felt outraged over the board\u2019s decision, and what it signals for the future of diversity and inclusion in the UNC system. Pragya Upreti, a rising junior at UNC Chapel Hill, told CNN she attended the student press conference, as well as the protest outside the UNC Board of Governors meeting on Thursday morning. She told CNN she believes the decision to repeal the DEI policy sends a message that the board doesn\u2019t value Black and brown students. \u201cTruly this administration has failed us, and it will continue to fail generations of students who saw opportunity in diversity, equity, and inclusion,\u201d Upreti said. Chantal Stevens, executive director of the ACLU of North Carolina, called the Board\u2019s vote \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d in a statement and she asked the board to reconsider. \u201cOur university campuses must be environments where students feel included and are able to fully engage academically, and DEI programs serve an important role in achieving this,\u201d Stevens wrote in the statement. \u201cPulling funding from these programs undermines these efforts and sends a worrying message about how committed our universities are to protecting the rights of students to be free from discrimination on the basis of their\u00a0race, ethnicity, disability, or other protected classes.\u201d The vote by the 24-member UNC System Board Thursday comes as diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at public universities and corporations across the country are facing a string of attacks from critics and conservative lawmakers. The new policy follows similar moves by state governments in Florida and Texas to ban DEI efforts from public colleges and universities. Schools in the UNC System are required to comply with the new policy by September 1. The proposal does not indicate how many DEI jobs might be impacted. Earlier this month, the Board of Trustees for the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill\u00a0passed a separate proposal to divert $2.3 million from DEI programs to public safety. One trustee pointed to recent protests on campus as part of the reason the Board voted to advance the proposal to shift funding to public safety measures. \u201cWe talk about peaceful protest, but when you destroy property, or you take down the US flag, and you have to put up gates around it costs money, or deploy officers to do that,\u201d Marty Kotis the vice chair of the board\u2019s budget and finance committee said. \u201cNorth Carolinians are watching all of this and they are not happy. And\u00a0[I] think it\u2019s imperative that we have the proper resources for our law enforcement to protect the campus, and that means our property and that means our flag as well.\u201d Major universities including the University of Florida and University of Texas at Austin have been forced to dismantle their DEI offices and programs and cut jobs to comply with state laws and regulations. Since 2023, 14\u00a0anti-DEI bills that\u00a0target programs at colleges have been signed into law,\u00a0according to a tally by the Chronicle of Higher\u00a0Education. North Carolina lawmakers passed a bill last year that bans diversity statements from state agencies, the University of North Carolina system, and community colleges. \u2018You will be able to feel the difference\u2019 The anti-DEI proposals at both the system-wide level and UNC at Chapel Hill\u2019s campus have left students worried about the future of diversity programs on campus if they are enacted. Ahead of the meeting, UNC System students gathered in Raleigh to speak out against the proposed changes.\u00a0 \u201cTo gut the DEI policy is to deny students both present and future of their right to a high-quality education,\u201d one student said, according to CNN affiliate WRAL. \u201cDiversity and equity and inclusion are foundational to education.\u201d\u00a0 Another student said she attends UNC Ashville and is concerned that enrollment will decline at UNC System schools because DEI programs are banned.\u00a0 \u201cPassing this anti-DEI policy will be a kiss of death for some of these systems and institutions,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd will be monumentally detrimental to future student interest to apply for and much less attend these UNC System Schools\u2026. We will all suffer.\u201d Toby Posel, co-policy chair for UNC Chapel Hill\u2019s Affirmative Action Coalition and a co-founder of the student organization TransparUNCy, said he was \u201cextremely disgusted and disappointed\u201d at both the UNC System and UNC board members for going against DEI. Posel said he is\u00a0concerned that the UNC system\u2019s anti-DEI policy leaves room for interpretation and it is unknown how jobs, programs and offices might be impacted. But regardless, Posel said the absence of DEI will make the campuses unwelcoming for people of color, LGBTQ+ students and first-generation college students. \u201cYou will be able to feel the difference,\u201d Posel said. \u201cIt will be significantly less welcoming, less safe, less supportive. Their academic lives are going to suffer, social lives are going suffer. This is a very clear statement from the highest level of university governance in North Carolina that (they) don\u2019t care about those students.\u201d Julian Taylor, executive board member of the Affirmative Action Coalition and a co-founder of TransparUNCy,\u00a0said he believes both boards are taking a political stance against DEI that aligns with a conservative movement instead of being neutral. The UNC Board of Governors is made up of 24 members who are elected by the Republican-led North Carolina General Assembly. The UNC Chapel Hill Board of Trustees has 15 members, including eight elected by the Board of Governors, six appointed by the General Assembly and one spot for the president of student government. Taylor said DEI initiatives have allowed UNC Chapel Hill to reckon with its history of slavery on campus. He worries that cutting DEI programs will impact curriculum and prevent this history from being taught. \u201cDEI is a small step in serving racial justice,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut a lot of this is about the larger, overarching debate about what we do to try to rectify past injustices. And this is a pretty clear answer from UNC and the UNC Board of Trustees saying that the answer to that question is \u2018absolutely nothing.\u2019\u201d CNN\u2019s Devon M.

Alexander Yuk Ching Ma, 71, of Honolulu, who served as a CIA officer over a seven-year period in the 1980s, worked with an unnamed co-conspirator in 2001 to provide Chinese intelligence \u201cwith a large volume of classified U.S. national defense information\u201d in exchange for tens of thousands of dollars, DOJ said, citing the plea agreement.

{"id": "2024_05_24_business_russian-frozen-assets-g7-ukraine", "text": "Money generated by Russian financial assets frozen in Europe will soon start flowing to Ukraine, giving Kyiv a boost as it struggles to counter an advance by Moscow\u2019s troops. Now, the West is trying to turn that trickle of cash into a flood. Finance officials from the G7 economies met in Stresa, Italy to discuss\u00a0new ways of using the proceeds from some \u20ac260 billion ($282 billion) of Russia\u2019s foreign currency reserves that were frozen by Western countries after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. \u201cProgress has been made \u2026 as far as the main issues are concerned,\u201d Italian Economy Minister\u00a0Giancarlo\u00a0Giorgetti\u00a0said Saturday during a press conference after the meeting, adding that there are some legal technical issues that still have to be resolved. There is \u201cstrong positioning in terms of a political stance by all the G7 countries,\u201d Giorgetti said. The G7 meeting comes just weeks after Russia mounted a surprise assault in Ukraine\u2019s northern Kharkiv region. As Russia\u2019s attacks intensify, Western leaders are coming under increasing pressure to deliver military aid to Kyiv\u2019s stretched armed forces. It is \u201cvital and urgent that we collectively find a way forward to unlock the value of Russian sovereign assets immobilized in our jurisdictions for the benefit of Ukraine,\u201d US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said during a speech Tuesday in Frankfurt, Germany. The proposal that reportedly has the broadest backing among US and EU officials involves lending as much as $50 billion to Ukraine, using the future windfall profits from Russian assets held in the European Union as collateral. The plan \u201cwould essentially bring forward that flow of interest proceeds from the assets\u2026 (through a loan) given to Ukraine,\u201d Yellen told broadcaster Sky News in an interview this week. \u201cUkraine has substantial needs, and being able to marshal significant resources to help Ukraine is important,\u201d she said. G7 finance ministers hope to agree on a way forward that can be signed off when President Joe Biden and other leaders meet for a summit in Italy next month. The plan stops short of seizing the assets outright. The EU is worried that such a move would discourage other countries from keeping their assets in the bloc. Most of the frozen Russian money is held in Europe, and the euro is the world\u2019s second-most important currency after the US dollar. The proposal \u201cis a halfway house to full seizure,\u201d Lee Buccheit, a veteran sovereign debt expert and honorary professor at the University of Edinburgh Law School, told CNN. From $3 billion to $50 billion? Around two-thirds of Russia\u2019s immobilized assets, or some \u20ac210 billion ($228 billion), sits in the EU, mostly at Euroclear, a Belgium-based financial institution that keeps assets safe for banks, exchanges and investors. Following months of discussions, the EU formally adopted an agreement Tuesday that taps the windfall profits Euroclear makes by reinvesting the cash generated by those assets \u2014 such as coupon payments on bonds. Western sanctions mean coupon payments and maturing assets cannot be sent to Russia. Under the EU agreement, between \u20ac2.5 and \u20ac3 billion ($2.7-3.3 billion) of these profits will be sent annually to Kyiv. The first payment will be made in July, with 90% earmarked for arms and military equipment. The split of funds will be reviewed each year starting in January 2025, with the option to shift spending toward rebuilding Ukraine\u2019s war-torn economy as its needs change. \u201cThe EU has chosen a way forward that is legally sound, and flexible so that support can adjust to Ukraine\u2019s most pressing needs,\u201d European Commissioner for Trade Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement Tuesday. Unlike the drip feed of funding agreed by the EU, the proposal under discussion by the G7 could deliver a much bigger lump sum, immediately.  Reuters reported Yellen as saying Thursday that a figure of $50 billion had been discussed by G7 ministers but there was no agreement yet on how big the collateralized loan should be. An even bigger check? Apart from seizing the stash of assets, or lending Kyiv money backed by the interest they earn, there\u2019s a third option the West might consider \u2014 a so-called reparations loan. Under this approach, Ukraine would borrow money from a syndicate of allies, including G7 members, and pledge as collateral its claim for reparations \u2014 or compensation \u2014 against Russia. This would give Kyiv access to a much larger amount of money than using future or current windfall profits from Russian assets. \u201cUkraine has a claim against Russia for reparations \u2014 legally, that is indubitable \u2014 and it would in effect be monetizing a portion of that claim by pledging it to secure this loan from the G7,\u201d Buchheit, the debt expert, said. If Russia failed to pay reparations, then the G7 would be in a position to draw on the pool of frozen assets to recover the value of its loan to Ukraine, he added. This mechanism also ensures that Russia foots part of the colossal bill for rebuilding Ukraine, which the World Bank has put at $486 billion over the next decade. \u201cShort of a regime change in Russia, Putin is never going to pay reparations,\u201d said Buccheit. \u201cThis $300 billion is probably the only contribution Russia will ever make for paying reparations for what it has done to Ukraine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/business/russian-frozen-assets-g7-ukraine/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_us_uvalde-shooting-victims-lawsuit", "text": "Nineteen families of the students and teachers killed or injured at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, announced Wednesday they have settled a lawsuit with the city for $2 million, and announced they are suing 92 officers with Texas Department of Public Safety, the school district and individual employees. \u201cIt has been an unbearable two years,\u201d Javier Cazares, the father of 9-year-old victim Jacklyn Cazares, said at a news conference. \u201cWe all know who took our children\u2019s lives, but there was an obvious systemic failure out there on May 24. The whole world saw that. \u201cNo amount of money is worth the lives of our children. Justice and accountability has always been my main concern. We\u2019ve been let down so many times, that time has come to do the right thing,\u201d he said. The city confirmed the settlement in a statement. \u201cToday, we are thankful to join the victims\u2019 families in arriving at an agreement that will allow us to remember the Robb Elementary tragedy while moving forward together as a community to bring healing and restoration to all those affected,\u201d the city said. \u201cWe will forever be grateful to the victims\u2019 families for working with us over the past year to cultivate an environment of community-wide healing that honors the lives and memories of those we tragically lost. May 24th is our community\u2019s greatest tragedy.\u201d The announcement of the settlement and the latest legal action come just before the two-year anniversary of\u00a0the mass shooting in which an 18-year-old stormed into the elementary school, killed 19 children and two teachers and barricaded himself in a classroom. A total of 376 law enforcement officers from across the region rushed to the school to respond, but ultimately none of them breached the door to the classroom to confront the shooter for 77 minutes. The slow response was at odds with law enforcement active shooter protocols, widely accepted after the Columbine school shooting in 1999, to stop the threat immediately. As part of the settlement, Uvalde will pay the families a total of $2 million from its insurance coverage, according to a statement from attorneys Josh Koskoff and Erin Rogiers. In addition, the city pledged to institute several policy changes to the police department, such as a new \u201cfitness for duty\u201d standard for police officers. The city will also establish May 24 as an annual Day of Remembrance, will create a committee to coordinate designing a permanent memorial and will support mental health services for the families, survivors and community, the attorneys said. The terms of the settlement were reached through a \u201crestorative justice process\u201d between impacted families and the city, the attorneys said. Pursuing further legal action against Uvalde could have bankrupted the city, a result that none of the families wanted, they added. In a statement, Koskoff called the settlement a step in the healing process, and the mother of a student who was killed said it reflected a \u201cgood faith effort.\u201d \u201cFor two long years, we have languished in pain and without any accountability from the law enforcement agencies and officers who allowed our families to be destroyed that day. This settlement reflects a first good faith effort by the City of Uvalde to begin rebuilding trust in the systems that failed to protect us,\u201d Veronica Luevanos, whose daughter\u00a0Jailah and nephew Jayce were killed, said in a statement. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t just Uvalde officers who failed us that day. Nearly 100 officers from the Texas Department of Public Safety have yet to face a shred of accountability for cowering in fear while my daughter and nephew bled to death in their classroom.\u201d Delayed law enforcement response widely criticized Also Wednesday, the attorneys announced they are suing 92 individual Texas DPS officers, the school district and several employees for their alleged failures responding to the shooting. \u201cLaw enforcement\u2019s inaction that day was a complete and absolute betrayal of these families and the sons, daughters and mothers they lost,\u201d Rogiers said in the statement. \u201cTXDPS had the resources, training and firepower to respond appropriately, and they ignored all of it and failed on every level. These families have not only the right but also the responsibility to demand justice, both for their own loss and to prevent other families from suffering the same fate.\u201d A spokesperson for the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District said the district \u201cremains committed to supporting our community throughout this process\u201d but declined to comment on the specifics of the case, citing the ongoing litigation. \u201cThe District continues to be open to exploring a resolution involving all the families and individuals impacted by this tragedy,\u201d said Anne Marie Espinoza, the district\u2019s executive director of communications and marketing. CNN has reached out to the Texas Department of Public Safety and the DPS Officers Association for a response. The disastrous police response has been criticized in a series of government investigative reports, although no one has faced criminal repercussions. A scathing US Department of Justice report in January blamed the failed response on \u201ccascading failures of leadership, decision-making, tactics, policy, and training\u201d on the part of law enforcement officials and said lives would have been saved if police had followed generally accepted practices. Uvalde school district police chief Pete Arredondo was fired in August 2022 for his role in the failed response to the mass shooting. His replacement, Joshua Gutierrez, has submitted his resignation and his last day on the job is set for June, according to a school official\u2019s statement. The lawsuit announced Wednesday is just the latest civil action related to the mass shooting. Previously, the family of Eliahna Torres, a 10-year-old victim, filed a lawsuit in November 2022 against nearly two dozen people and entities, including the gun manufacturer and store that provided the rifle used in the attack and law enforcement officials who responded to the scene. In addition, survivors of the shooting filed a $27 billion class action lawsuit in federal court in December 2022 against multiple Texas law enforcement agencies. A trial date has not been set in either lawsuit. Officials have said the shooter legally purchased the guns in the days after his 18th birthday.

{"id": "2024_05_25_business_why-do-we-eat-popcorn-at-the-movies", "text": "Even before the house lights dim, the cinema experience is well under way, with one concession-stand food holding top billing. Its roasty, buttery aroma fills the lobby, a smell that\u2019s both unmistakable and, often, core memory-inducing. A kernel smacks the side of a stainless steel kettle, a hint of the percussive symphony to come. As a white, fluffy wave boils up, the contents are scooped into a tub and drizzled \u2014 if you are lucky \u2014 with real melted butter. And as you slide into a cushioned seat, the delicate puffs give way to a soft crunch. It\u2019s Memorial Day weekend, the traditional start to the summer blockbuster movie season, and for 90-plus years and through generation after generation, the salty and buttery treat\u2019s symbiotic relationship with the cinema has remained. \u201cPopcorn and the movies are as inextricably linked as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, peanut butter and chocolate; and, as such, represent perhaps one of the greatest duos in modern history,\u201d Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore, told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more perfect combination and one that has become part of the culture in such a profound and ubiquitous way.\u201d The nation\u2019s largest movie chain, AMC Theaters, pops enough popcorn to fill 222 Olympic-sized swimming pools every year, according to the company. But the perfect (and very profitable) pairing of today wasn\u2019t always the case: For many years, movie theaters wanted nothing to do with the snack. A match made in oil and butter There\u2019s plenty of lore packed in to popcorn\u2019s origin story and a fair bit of drama involved in its \u201cshotgun wedding\u201d with the movies, according to Andrew F. Smith\u2019s \u201cPopped Culture: A Social History of Popcorn in America.\u201d Smith, in cataloging popcorn\u2019s rise, debunked most of the long-ingrained fables behind the snack. It was not a \u201cfirst Thanksgiving\u201d side dish but rather landed in New England in the early half of the 19th century, likely brought there by American sailors returning from South America. Popping corn became a popular recreational activity by the 1840s, after \u201cwire-on-the-fire\u201d poppers and popping apparatuses were invented. In the following decades, popcorn vendors proliferated at fairs, circuses and on city streets. More commercial operations emerged, Cracker Jack became a ballpark staple and a slow courtship with the movie exhibition business began. That business, saved by the advent of the \u201ctalkie,\u201d blossomed during the early 20th century. By 1930, a stunning 90 million people were going to the movies on a weekly basis, Smith wrote. The crowd appeared ripe for the picking to popcorn salesmen, but theater owners balked. \u201cTo some owners, vending all concessions was an unnecessary nuisance or \u2018beneath their dignity,\u2019\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cIn the rowdy, burlesque days, hawkers went through the aisles with baskets selling Cracker Jack and popcorn. Much of the popcorn was tossed in the air or strewn on the floors.\u201d In cinemas, the scattered popcorn bits would muck up the valuable carpet that was meant to emulate the grand theater lobbies. But cinema owners changed their tune, and popcorn\u2019s boom came during one of the unlikeliest of economic periods: The Great Depression. \u201cAt five or 10 cents a bag, popcorn was an affordable luxury for most Americans,\u201d Smith wrote. The popcorn-making initially took place outside of the theaters, where operators leased space to vendors as it was seen as too costly to outfit the buildings with vents. But once competitors started popping up and tales of \u201cpopcorn wealth\u201d spread like wildfire, the concession was brought in-house. \u201cPopcorn sold so well because of its aroma \u2014 the same smell that some theater owners had reportedly despised earlier,\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cThe aroma was maximized during the popping process. As soon as the machines were placed in the lobbies, business picked up.\u201d A national pastime On a recent Sunday morning here in South Minneapolis, a decades-long father-son tradition continued at the Riverview Theater, a single-screen cinema nestled among century-old bungalows. Ever since John Aitkin, 44, was a kid, he and his father, John Sr., have been catching movies at the Riverview. As they awaited the start of \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes,\u201d they were accompanied by other longstanding members of the monthly custom: a bucket of popcorn and a couple of soda pops. \u201c(Popcorn\u2019s) a pastime,\u201d the younger Aitkin said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m eating it, it makes everything feel OK. It\u2019s just \u2018popcorn and a movie,\u2019 and you can disappear from the anxiety of daily living.\u201d It\u2019s also an affordable escape. The medium bucket ran Aitkin a cool $2.50, half the price of his ticket that day. (This is the exception: In some regions, popcorn can easily run three or four times that.) The Riverview popcorn\u2019s fame and popularity extends beyond the walls of the 75-year-old building. For years, the neighborhood cinema has sold it to-go, an offering that helped the theater navigate 2020, said Loren Williams, the Riverview\u2019s owner. \u201cWhen the pandemic came, that was all we had,\u201d he told CNN of the community support. The post-pandemic picture After the pandemic reopenings, people were not only buying premium tickets, but also spending more on concessions, said Alicia Reese, an analyst who covers the media and entertainment industry for Wedbush. \u201cWe thought that there was just pent-up demand for going out and [people] treating themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this trend has persisted. It has not declined, and it\u2019s still growing.\u201d That\u2019s good news for theater operators at a time when attendance hasn\u2019t yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. That\u2019s because, at their heart, cinemas are mostly food service and real estate operations, said Ricard Gil, an associate professor who specializes in organizational economics at Queen\u2019s University in Canada. Generally, the ticket revenue is split 50-50 between the theater operators and the movie studios, said Gil, who previously researched why movie theater concessions come at steep prices. For the exhibitors, that half (or, oftentimes, less) isn\u2019t enough to recoup all the other costs. Concessions account for about one-third of overall domestic sales at the largest US chains of AMC and Cinemark, Wedbush\u2019s Reese said. \u201cOver 80% of that revenue is going to profit, which is substantial and unlike most other businesses,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reason for that is that most of the concession sales are popcorn, where the cost is quite low.\u201d Droids and sandworms filled with popcorn In 2023, AMC Theatres\u2019 food and beverage business totaled $1.67 billion in revenue, financial filings show. (By comparison, that\u2019s more than the annual revenue of restaurant chains like BJ\u2019s, Waffle House and Red Robin). \u201cThe sun rises and sets on our concession business,\u201d Nels Storm, AMC Theatres\u2019 vice president of food and beverage product strategy, said in an interview. And popcorn, he said, remains the \u201cvenerable force\u201d behind that business. But, given external threats to the industry, such as at-home entertainment and more options competing for consumers\u2019 almighty dollar, popcorn has to evolve with the times. For AMC, that\u2019s included launching a line of microwave and ready-to-eat popcorn for sale at retailers like Walmart and Kroger, offering unique or movie-themed flavors and leaning heavily into merchandising. Popular movies often bring collectible cups and popcorn buckets, or, in industry-speak, Collectible Concession Vehicles (CCVs). At AMC, these have included R2-D2 popcorn buckets; Ghostbusters\u2019 Ecto 1; the infamous Dune: Part Two sandworm; and, coming in June, a \u201cGarfield\u201d CCV that includes a plush doll \u2014 a fitting throwback to the days when stuffed versions of the lasagna-loving tabby were suctioned-cupped to car windows. For years, cinemas have broadened their concessions, with some taking it to the next level of dine-in theaters. Alamo Drafthouse, which got its start in 1997, offers a full menu and bar (complete with servers). Despite the full menu, popcorn remains the most frequently purchased food item, said Heather Morgan, Alamo\u2019s chief of staff and strategy. Alamo is quick to experiment with its popcorn and other concessions by tying them in to various theme nights, she said, noting that the chain created a berbere-spiced popcorn for \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d \u201cWe can see an uptick in sales, because people want to try the new and different flavors,\u201d she said. Chocolate popcorn and homegrown flavors Those unique takes extend to smaller theaters, as well. In Brooklyn, New York, Nitehawk Cinema is known for its truffle popcorn.  In Iowa City, Iowa, the nonprofit FilmScene cinema uses a recipe handed down from the University of Iowa\u2019s student cinema group. \u201cWe don\u2019t offer butter, and we promise you don\u2019t need it,\u201d Andrew Sherburne, FilmScene\u2019s executive director and co-founder, wrote via email to CNN. In Seattle, Emerald City film-lovers rejoiced when the iconic Cinerama theater was resurrected after a pandemic closure and its famed chocolate popcorn returned. At Cinelounge Cinemas in California, founder Christian Meoli crafted a line of eight artisan popcorns to be sold onsite, online and in stores. The movie-themed offerings \u2014 featuring flavors such as cinnamon churro, bourbon caramel and rosemary \u2014 also serve as a vehicle to spur investment in the film community: The proceeds help fund grants, screenings and equipment for aspiring filmmakers, he said. The cinema business will continue to evolve, but one thing will remain constant, said Gil of Queen\u2019s University. \u201cThe only economics of movie theaters that has changed is the romanticism of showing movies has gone away a little bit, and movie theater companies have realized that they are real estate companies, and they have capacity, and they need to fill the capacity, and they\u2019ll do whatever (it takes) to actually do that,\u201d Gil said. \u201cTheaters will stop playing movies before they will actually stop selling popcorn.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/business/why-do-we-eat-popcorn-at-the-movies/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_us_marilyn-mosby-baltimore-sentencing", "text": "A federal judge has sentenced Baltimore\u2019s former top prosecutor Marilyn Mosby to time served and 12 months of home confinement \u2013 to be served concurrently with 3 years of supervised release \u2013 for mortgage fraud and perjury. In addition, Mosby was ordered to complete 100 hours of community service, according to the judgment. Mosby, who gained national prominence for charging six police officers in connection with the 2015 death of Freddie Gray in a police van, was convicted in two trials of making a false mortgage application and perjury. US prosecutors had asked the court to sentence Mosby, 44, to 20 months in prison, followed by a supervised release, according to a May 9 sentencing memorandum. That sentence, the memo says, would \u201cmake clear that those who break the law, including those in positions of public trust, will be held accountable.\u201d Mosby has claimed she is innocent and the charges against her are politically motivated. Her attorneys\u00a0argued in a May 16 response she \u201chas been punished enough,\u201d asking for a sentence of time served with one year of supervised release. US District Court Judge Lydia Griggsby said she took into account that two juries found Mosby did something wrong and \u201cbreached a public trust,\u201d according to CNN affiliate WBAL-TV, which had a reporter in court. The judge also said the fact that Mosby is a mother of two weighed heavily on the court, according to the news station. In addition to Thursday\u2019s sentence, Griggsby ordered Mosby to forfeit 90% of her interests in the Longboat Key, Florida, condo connected to her conviction on making a false mortgage application. A preliminary order filed Thursday authorized the government to seize the property. Once sold, Mosby could receive up to $47,600 plus 10% of the home\u2019s appreciation value. Mosby walked out of court with her two daughters and alongside a group of supporters, including civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who chanted, \u201cJustice for Marilyn.\u201d Mosby told the crowd she was \u201ceternally grateful\u201d for all her supporters and advocates. \u201cThis is not over,\u201d she said. \u201cBut God was here today and I know he\u2019s with me, he touched the heart of this judge and has allowed me to go home to my babies.\u201d In a statement sent to CNN after the sentencing, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Maryland said, \u201cAs always, we respect the judgment of the court.\u201d Where the convictions stem from Mosby\u2019s trials, convictions and sentence mark\u00a0a remarkable undoing for a prosecutor who took office just months before\u00a0Gray died\u00a0from spinal injuries suffered while in police custody in the back of a van. Three officers were acquitted, leading Mosby to\u00a0drop the charges\u00a0against the rest. Her\u00a0sentencing follows Mosby\u2019s conviction on three charges across two trials. Mosby was first found guilty in November of two counts of perjury after prosecutors accused her of falsely claiming in 2020 she experienced \u201cadverse financial consequences\u201d as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic to withdraw $90,000 in retirement funds. At the time, she earned a gross salary of $247,955.58, the indictment said, and her pay was never reduced. Mosby then was found guilty in February of making a false mortgage application stemming from the purchase of a Florida condo, the Justice Department said. At trial, prosecutors presented evidence showing Mosby falsely stated she had gotten a $5,000 gift from her husband to be applied to the purchase of the property to get a lower interest rate. In fact, the Justice Department said, Mosby sent her husband $5,000, which he then transferred back to her. The jury in that trial acquitted Mosby of a second charge of making a false mortgage application stemming from the purchase of another Florida home.

The search for the errant animal stretched on for a second day Saturday. The Colleton County Sheriff\u2019s Office advised residents in a Facebook post on Friday that a primate is loose somewhere in the Walterboro area, 48 miles west of Charleston. Authorities didn\u2019t specify what kind of primate, though in a post on X, the sheriff\u2019s office labeled the missing animal as a \u201cprimate/ape.\u201d According to the sheriff\u2019s office, the animal\u2019s owner \u201cis attempting to capture it and has called in assistance.\u201d An image taken by Walterboro resident Tiffany Edenfield seems to show the primate standing in the grass. It has a red face, similar to some species of baboon and macaque monkeys. One Walterboro resident, Kordell Brabham, didn\u2019t believe his grandmother at first when she said she had spotted a \u201cmonkey\u201d in the yard. Brabham said he told her, \u201cNana, I think you need to go inside, it may be a little too hot out here for you.\u201d But soon after, he spotted the animal his grandmother was talking about. In a video shared with CNN, the escapee can be seen walking on top of a shed. Brabham was shocked and said the first thought running through his mind was, \u201cdon\u2019t get too close, that\u2019s a monkey.\u201d Brabham said the animal eventually climbed down from the shed and went into a nearby yard. Residents in the area are advised not to approach the primate, which the sheriff\u2019s office said \u201ccould be stressed,\u201d and only to report sightings. \u201cPlease monitor your pets while they are outside as a precaution,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office added. The sheriff\u2019s office received a report of the primate \u201cattempting to attack a resident\u2019s dog in a yard,\u201d according to South Carolina news station WLTX. It\u2019s unclear how the animal got loose or came to live in Walterboro, a city of over 5,000 people. South Carolina law says that it\u2019s illegal to purchase or possess great apes \u2013 chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. But it is legal to keep other wild animals as pets, according to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.

{"id": "2024_05_24_us_sahana-ramesh-lawsuit-seattle-reaj", "text": "A 16-year-old in Bothell, Washington, suffered from a severe allergic reaction to medication\u00a0for months before\u00a0she collapsed and died in front of her parents. Her family alleges discrimination and negligence contributed to her death. The family of Sahana Ramesh filed a lawsuit\u00a0in Washington\u2019s King County Superior Court against Seattle Children\u2019s hospital, Children\u2019s University Medical Group and\u00a0several unnamed healthcare workers. Sahana\u00a0died from eosinophilic\u00a0myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle,\u00a0in February 2021, according to the complaint. The lawsuit was first filed in 2022 by Sahana\u2019s parents Nalini and Anapathur Ramesh and their son,\u00a0Karthik,\u00a0and alleged negligence but was amended to include racial discrimination allegations,\u00a0according to court documents. Last week, King County Superior Court Judge Elizabeth Berns declined a motion brought by the hospital to dismiss the discrimination claim, court documents show. In her order, Berns wrote the family have \u201cplausibly alleged harm, including dignitary harm, resulting from unlawful discrimination \u2013 not from healthcare.\u201d In August\u00a02020, the family of South Asian descent sought medical treatment at Seattle Children\u2019s\u00a0because Sahana had recurring seizures, which led to a hospital neurologist\u00a0prescribing her lamotrigine, a drug used to prevent or control seizures, the suit says. Sahana\u2019s dosage was doubled shortly after she began taking it and increased by 50 percent that November. She then developed a\u00a0rash on several parts of her body including her hands, stomach, feet and face, the suit says. Within days, the rash worsened, and she was taken to the emergency department of Seattle Children\u2019s,\u00a0where she was diagnosed with a syndrome known as Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms or DRESS, according to the lawsuit. DRESS is a drug allergy that causes fever, rash, facial swelling, enlarged lymph nodes, kidney or liver injury, and in some cases inflammation of organs, according to the\u00a0American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Sahana was discharged after the diagnosis, but her symptoms didn\u2019t improve, her family claims in the suit. Over nearly three months, the family sought medical care from the defendants more than a dozen\u00a0times. During that time, her lab results also showed issues with her liver and organ function, the lawsuit says. But\u00a0the \u201cdefendants assured plaintiffs that Sahana could safely be cared for at home,\u201d according to the lawsuit. A spokesperson for Seattle Children\u2019s told CNN, \u201cOur hearts go out to any family mourning the loss of a child and we take our responsibility to provide equitable, high-quality care seriously, but cannot comment on this specific case due to pending litigation.\u201d CNN has reached out to Children\u2019s University Medical Group for comment. Steve Berman, an attorney for the Ramesh family, described Sahana\u2019s death as her family\u2019s \u201cultimate loss\u201d that could have been avoided. \u201cWe believe this was an avoidable tragedy that evidence shows was directly caused by negligence and lack of informed consent, rooted in widespread racism at the hospital,\u201d Berman said in a statement. The lawsuit points to several racial discrimination allegations made against the hospital, including claims that led to\u00a0a 2021 independent review\u00a0of equity, diversity and inclusion policies and practices. The review\u00a0concluded that allegations that a physician called another physician a racist epithet in 2009\u00a0were not adequately investigated by the hospital, and that there was a lack of action to minimize racial disparities in security calls, among other findings, according to a\u00a0summary made public by the hospital. In the lawsuit, attorneys for the family said their clients felt\u00a0ignored and dismissed during their interactions with medical staff and felt \u201cthat they were not welcome, accepted, desired, or solicited at SCH.\u201d The family also alleges in the lawsuit that hospital staff didn\u2019t monitor Sahana\u2019s heart and failed to inform them of the risk of cardiac failure related to DRESS.

The 36-year-old victim had non-life-threatening injuries and was transported to a local hospital, a news release from the police department said. Just before noon on Wednesday, the man was in the parking lot of the Alhikma Islamic Center in south Minneapolis retrieving items from his car when a minivan drove toward him at a high speed, police said. He attempted to run when the driver of the minivan swerved and struck him, according to police. \u201cBased on the information gathered by our investigators so far, I am concerned that this crime may have been motivated by bias,\u201d Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara said. \u201cWe won\u2019t tolerate any crime in our city. But hate crimes and crimes against our houses of worship are particularly troubling because of the very real widespread fear they generate and the potential division they create among our residents.\u201d The hit-and-run comes amid a surge in reported anti-Muslim bias incidents across the US in recent months \u2013 an increase the Council on American-Islamic Relations has called \u201cunprecedented.\u201d Last month, CAIR said it received 8,061 complaints of\u00a0anti-Muslim bias\u00a0incidents in 2023 \u2013 the highest number in the 28 years CAIR has tracked hate. Officers are working to locate the suspect and the van, according to the release. Police patrols have also been increased to protect those who enter and leave from the house of worship. Police department leadership is in communication with the imam and staff at the mosque, as well as community leaders, according to O\u2019Hara. Investigators are familiar with the suspect, O\u2019Hara said, as he has a \u201chistory of trespassing and acting erratically at the mosque and in the neighborhood.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Minneapolis Police Department for more information. The Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations says the victim is one of its staffers who was targeted by a man who CAIR alleges has harassed the mosque and worshipers many times in the past three years. \u201cThis apparently intentional attack outside a religious institution must be investigated as a possible hate crime,\u201d\u00a0said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR-Minnesota. \u201cWe urge stepped-up security and increased vigilance at Islamic institutions statewide.\u201d The department describes the suspect as \u201ca light complected, black male in his late 30s wearing a brown shirt and black glasses\u201d and driving a 2002 Silver Windstar minivan. The department has asked for tips from the public. The hit-and-run comes just over a year after a man allegedly set\u00a0fires at two Minneapolis mosques. The damage likely totaled tens of thousands of dollars, an affidavit against him said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/us/minneapolis-police-hit-and-run-mosque/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_24_us_alec-baldwin-rust-shooting-case", "text": "A judge in New Mexico denied Alec Baldwin\u2019s motion to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter indictment against him in the \u201cRust\u201d fatal shooting case, connected to the 2021 death of the film\u2019s cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins. Baldwin\u2019s attorneys had accused prosecutors of misconduct during the grand jury process and sought to have the case dismissed. In January, Baldwin pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the shooting. Hutchins was fatally shot and director Joel Souza was injured after a gun Baldwin was holding discharged a live round during a scene rehearsal on the New Mexico set of the western movie. It was the second time the actor pleaded not guilty to charges related to the shooting. Involuntary manslaughter charges were dropped against Baldwin in 2023, with prosecutors saying in a statement at the time that they could not \u201cproceed under the current time constraints and on the facts and evidence turned over by law enforcement in its existing form\u201d due to \u201cnew facts\u201d in the case. He was charged for a second time and indicted in January. Baldwin\u2019s lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the indictment in March. They accused prosecutors of engaging in misconduct and said prosecutors \u201cpublicly dragged Baldwin through the cesspool created by their improprieties \u2013 without any regard for the fact that serious criminal charges have been hanging over his head for two and a half years.\u201d Baldwin\u2019s lawyers claimed the prosecution presented false and inaccurate testimony to the grand jury, withheld exculpatory evidence from the grand jury, and gave them improper and prejudicial instructions. In response to Baldwin\u2019s team\u2019s March motion to dismiss the indictment, special prosecutors in New Mexico defended their case, saying Baldwin\u2019s behavior on the \u201cRust\u201d movie set contributed to \u201csafety compromises\u201d that led to the fatal shooting. In the order to deny Baldwin\u2019s motion to dismiss, the judge said despite the defense\u2019s claims,there was no prosecutorial bad faith, as Baldwin\u2019s legal team had claimed, and proper procedures were followed in the grand jury process. In the ruling, the judge said \u201cafter review of transcripts from the January 18, 2024 and January 19, 2024 grand jury presentations, the Court does not find that the \u2018prosecuting attorney assisting the grand jury\u2019 engaged in \u2018intentional misconduct\u2019 reflecting \u2018dishonesty of belief, purpose, or motive\u2019 in the course of the attorney\u2019s \u2018presentation of evidence to the grand jury.\u2019\u201d The film\u2019s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez Reed, who was responsible for firearm safety and storage on the movie\u2019s set, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in March. She was sentenced in April to 18 months in prison and is appealing. In a short statement to CNN following a judge\u2019s refusal to dismiss charges against Baldwin, Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro from the actor\u2019s legal team said: \u201cWe look forward to our day in court.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/us/alec-baldwin-rust-shooting-case/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/26/2024", "section": "us"}}
