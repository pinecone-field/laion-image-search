{"id": "2024_07_14_us_trump-rally-gunman-thomas-crooks-invs", "text": "This November, Thomas Matthew Crooks was set to reach a political milestone: The first presidential election he was old enough to vote in. A 20-year-old living in a crucial swing state, Crooks had already shown potential signs of interest in politics, making a small political donation as a teenager and registering to vote just a week after he turned 18. But instead of casting his ballot this year, according to law enforcement, Crooks traveled an hour north of his home, climbed to the roof of a building, and opened fire on former President Donald Trump during a campaign rally \u2014 leaving him bloodied and coming inches away from killing him. Crooks\u2019 attack, which killed one spectator and critically injured two others, rocked American politics to its core, with elected officials from both sides of the aisle condemning the violence and warning of the dangers of the country\u2019s deep polarization. So far, investigators haven\u2019t found any evidence on social media or other writings by Crooks that might help identify his motive for the attempted assassination, law enforcement officials say. But CNN interviews with more than a half-dozen former classmates and neighbors of Crooks painted him as quiet, with classmates remembering him as a good student and something of a misfit in high school. And a review of public records suggests he may have had divergent political leanings, with Crooks registering to vote as a Republican but making a small donation to a Democratic-leaning group. Crooks lived in the Pittsburgh suburb of Bethel Park, about an hour\u2019s drive south of the Trump rally where law enforcement officials say he fired at the former president. Crooks graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022, according to a local media report and a video of the school\u2019s graduation ceremony. Jason Kohler, 21, who went to the same high school, told CNN that Crooks was bullied by other students and seemed to be a loner. Crooks had \u201cno facial expression\u201d when he walked through the school hallways, Kohler said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t, like, with the clique, so he always had, I guess, a target on his back.\u201d Another former student at the school, Sarah D\u2019Angelo, remembered Crooks as \u201ca quiet kid, not obviously political or violent in any way.\u201d She said the only time he spoke with her was when their class was waiting for their graduation ceremony to start. A third classmate, who asked not to be named, said that Crooks was very smart, took honors classes, and was shy. She said that he had a group of friends who were fairly conservative, some of whom would wear Trump hats. \u201cThere was definitely chatter about him just looking a little different,\u201d the classmate said of Crooks. \u201cAlmost a retro nerd vibe.\u201d Crooks\u2019 high school experience was interrupted by the pandemic, with students being out of school for months in 2020 and allowed to study remotely after that, the classmate said \u2013 and she added that she didn\u2019t recall seeing him much during their sophomore or junior years. When she heard that Crooks was identified as the Trump rally shooter, the classmate said, \u201cI was just, like, shocked \u2014 I just couldn\u2019t believe he did something that bold, considering he was such a quiet and kept-to-himself kind of person.\u201d FBI agents \u2014 like Crooks\u2019 former classmates \u2014 were still trying to piece together his motives on Sunday. Kevin Rojek, the special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Pittsburgh field office, said the FBI was working to gain access to Crooks\u2019 phone. Investigators believe he acted alone, Rojek said, adding that they had not seen any indication Crooks had mental health issues. \u201cWe are working hard to determine the sequence of events related to the subject and his movements in the hours, days and weeks prior to the shooting,\u201d Rojek said, while noting that \u201cwe\u2019re still very early in this investigation.\u201d The gun Crooks used was a legally purchased AR-style weapon, Rojek confirmed. According to law enforcement officials, the gun was traced to Crooks\u2019 father, which helped to determine the gunman\u2019s identity because he was not carrying identification. When reached by CNN late Saturday night, Crooks\u2019 father, Matthew Crooks, said he was trying to figure out \u201cwhat the hell is going on\u201d but would \u201cwait until I talk to law enforcement\u201d before speaking about his son. He could not be reached again on Sunday. Federal Election Commission records show that a donor listed as Thomas Crooks with the gunman\u2019s street address gave $15 to Progressive Turnout Project, a Democratic-aligned political action committee, on Inauguration Day in January 2021, when Crooks was 17. A spokesperson for Progressive Turnout Project said in an email that the group had received the donation \u201cin response to an email about tuning into the inauguration\u201d and that \u201cthe email address associated with the contribution only made the one contribution and was unsubscribed from our lists 2 years ago.\u201d \u201cWe unequivocally condemn political violence in all of its forms, and we denounce anyone who chooses violence over peaceful political action,\u201d the spokesperson wrote. Later that year, a week after turning 18, Crooks registered to vote as a Republican, according to a listing in Pennsylvania\u2019s voter database that matched his name, age and address. Crooks only cast a ballot once, in the 2022 midterm general election, an Allegheny County spokesperson told CNN. Both of Crooks\u2019 parents worked as social workers, according to state license records. His father is registered to vote as a Libertarian and his mother is registered as a Democrat, state voter records show. Crooks fired on Trump while perched on a nearby building rooftop outside the rally\u2019s security perimeter, before being killed by Secret Service agents, according to law enforcement officials. Law enforcement descended on Crooks\u2019 family home on a quiet street in Bethel Park on Saturday night. Explosive material was found in his residence, as well as in his car, law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation told CNN. A brief video posted on Facebook by Crooks\u2019 school district in 2022 showed Crooks participating in a computer coding course and explaining a coding concept to a fellow student. Crooks can also be spotted sitting at the front of an economics class in a TV ad for the investment firm BlackRock that was filmed at his high school. The teachers featured in both the videos declined to comment. A spokesperson for the social media platform Discord said in a statement that it had identified an account that appears to be linked to Crooks. The account \u201cwas rarely utilized and we have found no evidence that it was used to plan this incident or discuss his political views,\u201d the spokesperson wrote. Crooks worked\u00a0as a dietary aide at\u00a0Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, a nursing home less than a mile from his family\u2019s home,\u00a0according to Marcie Grimm, the center\u2019s administrator. \u201cWe are shocked and saddened to learn of his involvement as Thomas Matthew Crooks performed his job without concern and his background check was clean,\u201d Grimm said in a statement. A colleague who worked with Crooks at the nursing home and who asked not to be named described him in an interview as \u201cthe sweetest guy.\u201d Just this week, the colleague said, the two of them worked together to find an easier way for nursing home residents to open ranch dressing packets, an act the colleague said was indicative of how caring Crooks was. \u201cThese stupid ranch packets in the kitchen \u2014 no one can ever open them,\u201d said the colleague, who also went to high school with Crooks. \u201cEarlier this week he was helping me with a bunch of sick old ladies (to) put ranch on their salads.\u201d Crooks, the colleague said, never expressed political views at work and wasn\u2019t \u201ca radical.\u201d They added: \u201cIt\u2019s hard seeing everything that\u2019s going on online because he was a really, really good person that did a really bad thing, and I just wish I knew why.\u201d Bethel Park is a predominantly white suburb that is wealthier than the surrounding Pittsburgh metro area. Dan Grzybek, a county council representative whose district includes Bethel Park, described it as politically mixed \u2014 according to county election records, President Joe Biden won the precinct that includes the Crooks\u2019 house with just 52% of the vote. Grzybek, who lives nearby, said he had had a \u201cvery pleasant\u201d conversation with the gunman\u2019s parents while canvassing for votes before he was elected last year. He described the community as \u201cincredibly safe\u201d and \u201cclose-knit,\u201d and said he hoped that the shooting was not \u201cwhat Bethel Park is remembered for.\u201d \u201cAll things like this do is increase the already extreme political polarization we experience, and increase the risk of future violence in retaliation,\u201d Grzybek said. Andrew Bianco, who lives two houses down the street from the Crooks family, agreed that the area was politically diverse, with some residents flying Trump flags and others displaying Biden ones. But he said he doesn\u2019t remember ever seeing political signage outside the Crooks\u2019 residence, and only saw the gunman\u2019s father when he stepped outside to mow the lawn. \u201cIf anything, you\u2019d be like, \u2018Does someone live there?\u2019\u201d Bianco said.

{"id": "2024_07_15_us_terrell-davis-united-airlines-flight-incident", "text": "Pro Football Hall of Famer Terrell Davis says he was wrongfully handcuffed and taken off a United Airlines plane over the weekend after he tapped a flight attendant\u2019s arm to ask for a cup of ice \u2013 and the airline says it has removed the attendant from duty while it reviews the incident and has reached out to Davis to apologize. The former Denver Broncos running back said authorities let him go after they determined the attendant made inaccurate accusations stemming from their interaction on Saturday\u2019s flight from Denver to California\u2019s Orange County. Davis said the incident left him feeling \u201chumiliated, embarrassed, powerless and angry\u201d and is calling for a \u201cthorough and proper investigation.\u201d \u201cI refuse to stand by without speaking out on this disgusting display of injustice and deplorable treatment,\u201d Davis wrote in a Monday Instagram post, the contents of which also appeared in a release from a law firm representing him. Davis, 51, was flying with his wife, two sons and daughter when one of the sons asked for a cup of ice during beverage service, Davis wrote. A flight attendant \u201ceither didn\u2019t hear or ignored his request and continued past our row,\u201d the post read. \u201cI calmly reached behind me and lightly tapped (the attendant\u2019s) arm to get his attention to again ask for a cup of ice for my son,\u201d Davis wrote. \u201cHis response and the events that followed should stun all of us. \u201cHe shouted, \u2018Don\u2019t hit me,\u2019 and left the cart to hurriedly approach the front of the plane. I was confused, as were the passengers in front of me who witnessed the exchange. I thought nothing of it other than this particular employee was incredibly rude and blatantly wrong in his accusations of me hitting him.\u201d Davis did not see or interact with the attendant for the rest of the flight, he wrote. After the plane landed in Orange County, the pilot asked passengers to remain seated, and FBI and law enforcement agents went to Davis\u2019s seat, put him in handcuffs and took him off the plane \u2013 with the scene \u201crecorded by multiple passengers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDuring questioning, it was rightfully determined by the agents that this flight attendant was inaccurate in his accusations and the agents profusely apologized,\u201d Davis wrote. \u201cThe traumatizing experience of my two sons, my daughter and my wife watching me being placed in handcuffs \u2013 without due process or any explanation \u2013 cannot be undone,\u201d Davis wrote. The FBI\u2019s Los Angeles field office acknowledged on Monday that agents and law enforcement partners respond to a report of an incident with a flight that landed Saturday at Orange County\u2019s John Wayne Airport. A person who was detained for questioning \u201cwas cooperative with law enforcement and was released to continue his travels,\u201d the FBI office said. The FBI does not provide details of incidents or names of people who might have been interviewed unless charges are filed publicly, FBI field office spokesperson Laura Eimiller said. United Airlines has \u201cremoved the flight attendant from duty while we closely review this matter,\u201d the company said in an email to CNN on Monday evening. \u201cThis is clearly not the kind of travel experience we strive to provide, and we have reached out to Mr. Davis\u2019 team to apologize,\u201d United Airlines\u2019 email read. What happened on the flight \u201cis appalling and disturbing to say the least,\u201d Parker Stinar, managing partner of the Chicago-based law firm representing Davis, wrote in an email to CNN. \u201cWe plan on fully investigating\u00a0the events that took place and are actively contacting United Airlines in this matter,\u201d Stinar wrote. One of only eight running backs to have rushed more than 2,000 yards in an NFL season, Davis played seven seasons in the NFL \u2013 all with the Broncos \u2013 from 1995 to 2001, and helped the Broncos win two Super Bowls in January 1998 and January 1999. He was named MVP of that first title game, rushing for 157 yards and scoring three touchdowns in the Broncos\u2019 31-24 win over the Green Bay Packers. The three-time Pro Bowler was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/us/terrell-davis-united-airlines-flight-incident/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_joe-biden-tests-positive-covid-19", "text": "President Joe Biden tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday, disrupting a key campaign event meant to shore up support with Latino voters at a critical juncture in the election. Biden, 81, was experiencing mild symptoms and has received his first dose of the antiviral drug Paxlovid, according to his doctor. \u201cI feel good,\u201d Biden, who is fully vaccinated and boosted, told reporters Wednesday in Las Vegas, flashing a thumbs-up before boarding Air Force One to head to his Delaware residence. The president will self-isolate there in line with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. Biden and his aides have repeatedly cited recent stops on the campaign trail as a demonstration of his vigor as the presumptive Democratic nominee, an attempt to tamp down growing anxieties within the party. Wednesday\u2019s event in Las Vegas \u2013 where he was expected to speak at the UnidosUS annual conference \u2013 was billed as an example of that direct engagement, in this case with a diverse coalition. The UnidosUS event, however, came to a screeching halt with the news that the president had tested positive for Covid-19 following an active day participating in an interview and meeting voters at a local supermarket. \u201cI was just on the phone with President Biden. And he shared his deep disappointment at not being able to join us this afternoon. The president has been at many events as we all know and he just tested positive for Covid,\u201d\u00a0UnidosUS President and CEO Janet Murgu\u00eda told attendees, to audible gasps, after Biden was an hour and a half late to his scheduled appearance onstage. It\u2019s unclear where and when the president contracted Covid-19. But the sudden diagnosis will place him behind closed doors at a time when Democratic lawmakers have been clamoring to see him out front. The CDC recommends staying home until the infected person has been without a fever \u2013 with no fever-reducing medicine \u2013 for at least 24 hours and symptoms have been improving for 24 hours. It then recommends wearing a mask for five days after. As for Biden\u2019s schedule in the coming days and his ability to stay engaged, a White House official told CNN that the president has had Covid-19 before and gotten through those periods by doing a lot of video calls. Something similar should be expected in the days ahead, the official said. A campaign source separately told CNN that the Biden campaign will readjust and do as much as possible remotely. Biden was at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, residence last weekend as well, making calls to key groups of lawmakers, some of whom continue to harbor deep concerns about his viability as a candidate. The attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump appeared to put public calls for Biden to step aside as the party\u2019s presumptive nominee on pause. But they returned as Biden hit the campaign trail again this week. Just hours before the White House announced Biden\u2019s Covid-19 diagnosis, California Rep. Adam Schiff, a Senate candidate and former House Intelligence chairman, became the most prominent elected Democrat to\u00a0publicly call on the president to drop out of the race. As Trump is set to formally accept the GOP nomination for president at\u00a0this week\u2019s Republican National Convention\u00a0in Milwaukee, Democratic fears persist that Biden cannot defeat him and risks taking down Democrats in down-ballot races with him in November. But even though anger and panic has been steadily rising inside the Democratic Party after Biden\u2019s alarming debate performance in Atlanta nearly three weeks ago, the White House and the Biden campaign are in a new place, multiple Democratic officials told CNN. \u201cThe private conversations with the Hill are continuing,\u201d a senior Democratic adviser tells CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating the campaign and the White House. \u201cHe\u2019s being receptive. Not as defiant as he is publicly.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s gone from saying, \u2018Kamala can\u2019t win,\u2019 to \u2018Do you think Kamala can win?\u201d the adviser said. \u201cIt\u2019s still unclear where he\u2019s going to land but seems to be listening. Despite Biden\u2019s diagnosis, Vice President Kamala Harris was set to keep her Thursday appearance at a campaign event in Fayetteville, North Carolina, as planned, an administration staffer said Wednesday evening. Harris\u2019 husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, tested positive for Covid-19\u00a0earlier this month \u2013 though the vice president tested negative for the virus at the time. Biden, who was spotted not wearing a mask Wednesday before boarding Air Force One, was wearing one in the car and wore one aboard the aircraft to Delaware, a White House official said. Biden had \u201cupper respiratory symptoms, to include rhinorhea (runny nose) and non-productive cough, with general mailaise,\u201d a note from his doctor provided by White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. \u201cHe felt okay for his first event of the day, but given that he was not feeling better, point of care testing for COVID-19 was conducted, and the results were positive for the COVID-19 virus,\u201d the note continued. The president first\u00a0tested positive\u00a0for Covid-19 in July 2022 and suffered\u00a0a second, so-called rebound case in the days after. Biden has received multiple Covid-19 vaccine booster shots, most recently in September 2023,\u00a0according to a memo from his physician. During his first bout with the disease, he experienced mild symptoms, including runny nose, fatigue, high temperature and a cough and was treated with Paxlovid. Covid-19 levels across the country have\u00a0risen in recent weeks, according to the CDC. The most recent data shows that during the week ending July 6, there was a 23.5% increase in emergency visits for Covid-19 compared with the previous week. The CDC also reports that the viral activity level for Covid-19 in wastewater is high nationally as of July 6. This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_07_16_us_trump-rally-security-errors-list", "text": "Security errors, lapses and missed opportunities to stop a gunman led to the first shooting of a US president or former president in more than a generation. Here are several issues and problems identified by CNN that could or should have been addressed before the attack on former President Donald Trump. In addition, CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller provided his analysis of some of the issues and their importance. Unsecured rooftop in range of the stage and with clear line of sight The building used by the gunman was outside the \u201chard perimeter\u201d set by the United States Secret Service inside which every person is screened. But less than 500 feet from the stage, the building was within shooting range and had a clear line of sight to where the former president stood to address the crowd. Building access not controlled No one stopped the shooter from reaching the roof of the American Glass Research building. Potential confusion about law enforcement presence Snipers from the Butler County Emergency Services Unit were in the same complex, a source familiar with the ongoing investigation told CNN, but were not aware of the gunman on the roof. They were positioned on the second floor, watching the rally crowd, the source said. Agencies initially blamed each other The Secret Service was \u201csolely responsible\u201d for implementation of security at the rally, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle told CNN\u2019s Whitney Wild. \u201cAt that particular site, we divided up areas of responsibility, but the Secret Service is totally responsible for the design and implementation and the execution of the site,\u201d she told CNN Tuesday evening. But Cheatle earlier told ABC News her agents only \u201cshared support\u201d for the building used for the shooting. \u201cWe sought assistance from our local counterparts for the outer perimeter,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was local police in that building \u2013 there was local police in the area that were responsible for the outer perimeter of the building.\u201d Cheatle said in the same interview that protection for Trump was the responsibility of the Secret Service and \u201cthe buck stops with me.\u201d Crowd flagged gunman on roof almost 2 minutes before shooting Attendees in the crowd noticed the gunman on the roof nearly two minutes before the shots were fired, according to a CNN analysis of witness video and the official video feed of Trump\u2019s speech. As Trump questioned if Biden \u201cwas doing the job,\u201d someone on the video said, \u201cLook they\u2019re all pointing.\u201d One minute and 57 seconds later, gunfire can be heard. \u201cMy wife ran up to law enforcement and was trying to tell them where he was,\u201d Mike DiFrischia, a witness who took video of the shooting, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. \u201cBut they couldn\u2019t seem to see him because they weren\u2019t in the right spot to see him on the roof. They were too close to the building.\u201d Shooter was apparently seen acting suspiciously early by security cordon The shooter was spotted by local law enforcement who thought he might have been acting suspiciously near the magnetometers on Saturday, according to a senior law enforcement official. They put it out over their radio to keep an eye on him \u2013 and that information was passed to Secret Service as well, according to the source. When the shooter left the area of the magnetometers, he apparently wasn\u2019t seen again until people alerted law enforcement in a field outside the event that he was on the rooftop. About an hour before the incident, a person wearing clothing resembling the gunman\u2019s was also captured on video in front of the building whose roof the shooter later climbed, according to footage obtained by CNN affiliate WTAE. Pennsylvania State Police told WTAE they are looking into the video as a part of the investigation. CNN has reached out\u00a0to the state police for more information. Local officer unable to tackle gunman before he fired at stage Butler Township police officers were alerted to calls about a suspicious person near the rally on Saturday, the head of another law enforcement agency told CNN. They discovered the man on the roof and one local officer hoisted another to get up to the ledge, Butler County Sheriff Michael T. Slupe said. The shooter turned around, saw the officer peering over and pointed his gun at him. The officer let go of the ledge to \u201ctake cover\u201d and save his life. The gunman then started firing from the rooftop.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/us/trump-rally-security-errors-list/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "us"}}

The suspect refused commands to drop the knives and charged the other man, and five officers opened fire, killing the assailant, according to the chief. \u201cSomeone\u2019s life was in danger,\u201d Norman said at the news conference. \u201cThese officers, who are not from this area, took (it) upon themselves to act to save someone\u2019s life today.\u201d Two knives were recovered at the scene, Norman said. Authorities believe the initial altercation was not related to the convention. The shooting came a day after the start of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and just days after former President Donald Trump was injured in an attempted assassination. Law enforcement officials have set up extensive security measures around the convention at the Fiserv Forum. The shooting happened on the convention\u2019s outer security perimeter, within the zone where their officers were assigned, Columbus Division of Police Chief Elaine Bryant said in a statement. The chief released video from the body-worn camera of one officer involved in the shooting. The 31-second video, which begins partially blurred, starts with the officers engaged in a briefing before turning their attention to an altercation involving two men nearby. \u201cHe\u2019s got a knife. Yes he does,\u201d one officer says in the video. They immediately draw their weapons and run toward the altercation, yelling at the armed man, \u201cDrop the knife!\u201d the video shows. As the officers come near, one man holding something in each hand appears to move toward the other man, the video shows. The officers then shoot at the moving man, and he falls to the ground, the video shows. Man identified as Samuel Sharpe Jr. Samuel Sharpe Jr., 43,\u00a0is the man fatally shot by police on Tuesday, his sister Angelique Sharpe told CNN. She said her brother lived in a tent across the street from where the shooting happened. Although she\u2019s not sure what led to Tuesday\u2019s altercation, she said on Saturday and Tuesday her brother had told his family that\u00a0some other men had been threatening to kill him and his dog. \u201cI saw the bodycam\u00a0video. If they were concerned about him having a knife, then tase the guy and take away the knife and figure out what\u2019s happening,\u201d Angelique Sharpe said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a physical altercation and you\u2019re fighting for your life, you\u2019re in that moment. They didn\u2019t even give my brother time to react to their commands.\u201d Sharpe\u2019s sister, who lives in Milwaukee and is a small business owner, told CNN her brother was a devout Bible reader who\u00a0lived with his mother until January, when he moved out with his dog to live among\u00a0unhoused people and spread his faith. \u201cHe wanted to move down there to read the Bible and share with them that God hasn\u2019t forgotten about them, and he wanted to let them know that even though society has forgotten about them, God hasn\u2019t forgotten about them,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cHe was a really loving and compassionate person. When he would get money, he would give it away to other people. He was a chill guy who loved God.\u201d Sharpe is survived by his mother and sister. Mayor and activists react to police shooting Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said the shooting was a tragedy that appears to be justified. \u201cAny officer in that same situation where they witness somebody who\u2019s going to cause death or serious bodily harm to somebody with a gun or, in this case, with a knife \u2013 not just one knife, but two knives \u2013 would have taken the exact same action to preserve life,\u201d Johnson told CNN\u2019s Ryan Young. The force from Columbus is in Milwaukee to assist with security for the Republican National Convention, but Johnson said the incident had no connection to the convention. Johnson, a Democrat who has endorsed President Joe Biden for the upcoming election, said Trump called him Tuesday to express appreciation for the city\u2019s public safety efforts hosting the convention. Last year, the US Department of Justice released recommendations for reform of the Columbus Division of Police following a nearly two-year review of its policies. The division requested the review after facing multiple controversies, including criticism over its management of racial justice protests in 2020 and deadly police shootings, including those of\u00a0Andre Hill\u00a0and\u00a0Ma\u2019Khia Bryant. The recommendations were aimed at strengthening the police department\u2019s relationship with the community and included longer training periods for officers and technology improvements. The fatal shooting sparked anger and criticism by local activists. At an evening news conference held by people calling for police accountability, activist Alan Chavoya said, \u201cWe\u2019re not even two days into this RNC and we have a casualty. How is that possible? And guess what, as always, no answers from the MPD. No transparency, no accountability.\u201d \u201cWe want answers, we want to know why was there an out-of-state police officer in this area in the first place,\u201d Pastor Radontae Ashford of the Infinite Church said at the news conference. \u201cThere\u2019s only two reasons \u2026 that any of us that even live in Milwaukee would even be in this area, either for something helpful or something harmful.\u201d In a statement, the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin called for a \u201cfull and transparent\u201d investigation into what led up to the shooting. \u201cMore than 4,000 additional law enforcement officials are in Milwaukee for the RNC, and we\u2019ve long feared how this heavy police presence could increase the risk of deadly police encounters, especially by out-of-state officers who don\u2019t know and aren\u2019t accountable to our community,\u201d the statement from Executive Director Melinda Brennan read. \u201cWe offer our condolences to the friends and family of the person killed.\u201d CNN\u2019s Andy Rose and Eric Levenson contributed to this story.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/us/police-fatally-shoot-man-near-republican-national-convention/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_fact-check-night-3-republican-national-convention", "text": "Night\u00a0three of the Republican National Convention has kicked off in Milwaukee. CNN\u2019s Facts First team is fact checking the convention and will update this page throughout the\u00a0night. Newt Gingrich on the war in Afghanistan under Trump Former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich claimed that \u201cPresident Trump orchestrated an orderly end to the Afghanistan war with no American killed in nearly two years.\u201d Facts first: Both of these claims are false. Although Trump oversaw a deal with the Taliban aimed at the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, the war did not end under his presidency. The last US troops left Afghanistan in August 2021 under the Biden administration. Moreover, there is no period of \u201cnearly two years\u201d under Trump\u2019s presidency where no American service member was killed. During his four years in office, there were 45 US service member hostile deaths, according to the Defense Casualty Analysis System. The longest stretch without combat deaths was at the end of his presidency, from March 2020 until he left office in January 2021 \u2013 less than a year. From CNN\u2019s Jennifer Hansler Former Trump intel chief misleadingly says \u2018Taliban is back\u2019 Richard Grenell, who served as the acting Director of National Intelligence in 2020, said Wednesday night that under President Joe Biden \u201cthe Taliban is back.\u201d \u201c[A]fter four years of Joe Biden, wars are back, the Taliban is back and members of ISIS have slipped through America\u2019s broken southern border,\u201d Grenell said. Facts first: The claim that the \u201cTaliban is back\u201d is misleading, as\u00a0it insinuates the Taliban ever left.  While it\u2019s true that the Taliban returned to power after the United States\u2019 2021 withdrawal, the Taliban remained present in Afghanistan throughout former President Donald Trump\u2019s time in office. The US, under the Trump administration, and the Taliban signed a historic agreement in 2020 that set into motion the US\u2019 withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. Officials within the Trump administration also met with Taliban representatives \u201crepeatedly\u201d in Doha for nearly a year, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction said in a 2019 report. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky Rep. Ronny Jackson\u2019s false claim of \u2018record-high inflation\u2019 Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas claimed in his Republican National Convention speech on Wednesday that there has been \u201crecord-high inflation\u201d under the Biden administration. Facts First: This is false. The record for US inflation, set in 1920, is 23.7%; the Biden-era peak was 9.1% in June 2022. Jackson could fairly say there was a four-decade high under Biden \u2013 that June 2022 figure was the highest since late 1981 \u2013 but there was nothing close to a new record. In addition, Jackson didn\u2019t mention that inflation has fallen sharply since the Biden-era peak two years ago. The current inflation rate, for June 2024, is 3%. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale RNC chairman\u2019s false claim about Russia\u2019s nuclear missiles near Cuba RNC Chairman Michael Whatley claimed in his opening speech on Wednesday evening that Russia has \u201cparked a nuclear missile capable boat\u201d in Cuba. \u201cWhere are we today? Russia has invaded Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve parked a nuclear missile capable boat 90 miles off our shore in Havana, Cuba.\u201d Facts first: This claim about the status of a Russian boat is false. While Russia did have a nuclear-powered submarine visiting Cuba in June along with other Russian Navy vessels, all of the vessels \u2013 including the submarine \u2013 have since left.  A group of four Russian Navy vessels arrived in Cuba on June 12 as part of what Pentagon and State Department officials stressed is a routine activity and noted that Cuba has hosted Russian ships every year between 2013 and 2020. A Pentagon spokesperson, Maj. Charlie Dietz, said in June that \u201cgiven Russia\u2019s long history of\u00a0Cuban port calls, these are considered routine naval visits, especially in the context of increased US support to Ukraine and NATO exercises.\u201d The nuclear-powered submarine, the Kazan, was the first of the vessels to leave Havana on June 17. From CNN\u2019s Haley Britzky RNC video falsely claims there was peace in the Middle East under Trump A video played early in the Republican National Convention proceedings on Wednesday night claimed that the \u201cstrength\u201d of President Donald Trump kept \u201cthe Middle East at peace.\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley had similarly claimed in his convention speech on Monday that the Middle East was \u201cat peace\u201d four years ago under Trump. Facts First:\u00a0The claim that there was peace in the Middle East under Trump is false. Whatever the merits of the Abraham Accords that Trump\u2019s administration helped to negotiate, in which Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates\u00a0agreed in 2020 to normalize relations with Israel\u00a0(Morocco and Sudan followed), there was still lots of unresolved armed conflict around the Middle East when Trump left office in early 2021. The list notably included\u00a0the civil war in Yemen;\u00a0the civil war in Syria; and the conflicts between Israel and Palestinians in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0and\u00a0the West Bank, between Israel and\u00a0Hezbollah on its border with Lebanon,\u00a0between Israel and Syria, and what former State Department official\u00a0Aaron David Miller called \u201cthe war between the wars\u00a0between Israel and Iran on air, land and sea.\u201d\u00a0Also,\u00a0the US, its allies and civilians\u00a0continued to be attacked\u00a0in an unstable Iraq. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly inaccurate statement,\u201d Miller, who worked on Mideast peace negotiations while in government and is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said last fall, when Trump himself made a similar claim about having achieved peace in the Middle East. Dana El Kurd, senior nonresident fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC think tank, also called that claim \u201cfalse\u201d when Trump made it. She said in a November email: \u201cThe Abraham Accords did not achieve peace in the Middle East. In fact, violence escalated in Israel-Palestine in the aftermath of the Accords (using any metric you can think of \u2013 death tolls, settlement violence, etc).\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale RNC video cites right-wing think tank without mentioning it was doing so A video played at the beginning of Republican National Convention proceedings on Wednesday evening attacked President Joe Biden\u2019s handling of foreign policy \u2013 and featured a narrator saying, \u201cThe Defense News reports today that the US military is in decline and threats from China are formidable.\u201d Facts First: This claim is misleading. Defense News, an independent publication covering national security, did not itself assert that the US military is in decline. Rather, the publication reported that the right-wing Heritage Foundation think tank had made that assertion. A Defense News article in October 2022 was headlined, \u201cUS military in decline, threats from China \u2018formidable,\u2019 report says.\u201d\u00a0The article explained that these assertions came from \u201ca new\u00a0report\u00a0by the\u00a0Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that each year analyzes the strength of the armed forces and the threats to America.\u201d From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/fact-check-night-3-republican-national-convention/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "us"}}

The refinery, know as ExxonMobil\u2019s Joliet Refinery, is located in neighboring Channahon, Illinois. Channahon Fire Chief John Petrakis told CNN Wednesday that the tornado was just on the other side of Interstate 55 from the refinery. Gasoline futures for the Chicago region jumped about 11 cents a gallon in trading Tuesday, Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates, told CNN. That came even as other gasoline future prices fell slightly nationwide. The power outage at the refinery \u201cis a significant event,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are three refineries in the Chicagoland area: BP (in Whiting Indiana) with a capacity of 440,000 barrels per day, ExxonMobil Joliet at 275,000 and Citgo in Lemont Illinois at 194,000,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen one of these refineries shuts, there is little to no cushion of extra supply in the area.\u201d Wholesale futures for Chicago were up another 4 cents a gallon in Wednesday trading, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the OPIS. He said that oil prices have been relatively weak this summer nationally, with even Hurricane Beryl\u2019s hit on the Houston area not being enough to lift prices. But this refinery is major enough to have a impact on local prices. The line of storms that hit the area Monday night produced 11 tornadoes in the greater Chicago area, including the one that hit Channahon, according to the National Weather Service. It will take a few days to return the Joliet refinery to normal production, assuming no damage occurred beyond the power outage, Lipow said. ExxonMobil has yet to reply to questions about damage or its operational plans. If damage delays a return of production, gasoline will need to be shipped up from the Gulf Coast via pipeline which will take a couple of weeks to get to the Chicago market, Lipow said. Lipow said he expects prices will start to rise at Chicago stations almost immediately. The the Chicago area is already at $4.07 a gallon, according to AAA, but that average price, based on Tuesday\u2019s prices, was down 1 cent from the previous day.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/business/chicago-gasoline-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_us_nassau-county-transgender-ban-lawsuits", "text": "New York\u2019s attorney general and the local affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union are both separately suing a New York county after it again banned transgender women from playing on female sports teams. The new legislation affecting Nassau County facilities takes the place of an executive order recently struck down in a New York court after it was put in place in February. The Nassau County Legislature voted 12 to 5 to pass the new law\u00a0in June. Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman said he was disappointed New York Attorney General Leticia James was suing the county. \u201cI am very disappointed that the Attorney General would attempt to frustrate Nassau County\u2019s desire to protect the integrity of women\u2019s sports, ensure the safety of its participants and provide a safe environment for girls and women to compete,\u201d Blakeman said Monday in a statement. James\u2019 suit says the Nassau County law violates New York State\u2019s Human Rights Law\u00a0and Civil Rights Law, in addition to violating Section 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law. In a Monday news release, the attorney general said the new law mirrors the February executive order. \u201cHere in New York, every person has the right to be exactly who they are free from discrimination, and my office will always protect that right,\u201d James said in the release. According\u00a0to the New York Civil Liberties Union, these laws provide \u201clocal governments with the power to adopt local laws so long as those local laws are \u2018not inconsistent with any general law\u2019 of the state.\u201d There are more than 100 county-owned athletic facilities in the Long Island county and in order to comply with the new law, those who want to participate or run leagues and teams \u201cwill be forced to make invasive inquiries about cis women and trans women\u2019s gender identities alike, intrude upon their privacy and bodily autonomy, and \u2018out\u2019 people as transgender,\u201d the civil liberties organization said\u00a0in a news release Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re suing Nassau County \u2013 again \u2013 for their discriminatory law banning trans girls and women from participating in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports at county-run facilities,\u201d the group posted on X. \u201cThe law is nearly identical to the County Executive\u2019s order, which our lawsuit recently struck down.\u201d Judge struck down 1st order in May In February, Blakeman signed an executive order that banned transgender women and girls\u00a0from competing on female sports teams and leagues on county-owned facilities. The New York Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in March\u00a0on behalf of Long Island Roller Rebels, a women\u2019s flat track roller derby league from Nassau County, arguing the county\u2019s February executive order violated New York\u2019s human rights law and civil rights law. Nassau County Supreme Court Judge\u00a0Francis Ricigliano struck down the order in May, saying\u00a0Blakeman did not have the authority to issue it, according to court filings. \u201cNYCLU and the Long Island Roller Rebels won their first lawsuit and County Executive Blakeman\u2019s transphobic executive order was struck down because it was blatantly illegal,\u201d James said\u00a0in her Monday release.\u00a0\u201cNow this discriminatory law must be as well.\u201d \u201cSports should be about challenging yourself and finding joy through movement,\u201d\u00a0Curly Fry, president of Long Island Roller Rebels said. \u201cTrans people belong everywhere including in sports. Much like we defeated the transphobic executive order, we will fight this new law and ensure all community members can join a sports team and feel welcome.\u201d New York is among 25 states \u2013 including California,  Georgia and New Jersey, that do not have statewide laws banning transgender students from competing on sports teams that align with their gender identities, according to data\u00a0from Movement Advancement Project,\u00a0a nonprofit think tank.

{"id": "2024_07_16_us_hannah-gutierrez-reed-rust-dismissal", "text": "Attorneys for \u201cRust\u201d movie armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed \u2013 convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the 2021 on-set fatal shooting of a cinematographer \u2013 have filed a motion for a new trial or to have her case thrown out after the related case against actor Alec Baldwin was dismissed in dramatic fashion last week. The attorneys filed the motion Tuesday in New Mexico\u2019s Santa Fe First Judicial District Court, citing \u201cegregious prosecutorial misconduct\u201d and multiple\u00a0allegations of \u201csevere and ongoing discovery violations by the state.\u201d Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorneys ask the court to order her prison release and to remove Kari Morrissey as the case\u2019s special prosecutor \u201cfor the misconduct that has been found, and the violations committed in Ms. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s case.\u201d On Friday, the involuntary manslaughter\u00a0case against Baldwin \u2013 who authorities said held the prop gun that fired the shot that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in October 2021 \u2013 was dismissed\u00a0after the judge overseeing the case ruled prosecutors did not properly turn over evidence to the defense. Legal experts had said the collapse of the actor\u2019s case could result in Gutierrez Reed being freed from the New Mexico state prison, where she\u2019s serving an 18-month sentence following her March conviction. In Tuesday\u2019s filing, Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorneys argue that her case should be thrown out or retried in part because of the judge\u2019s determination of withheld evidence in Baldwin\u2019s case; what they assert was Morrissey lying in court about the evidence on Friday; and what they say were other instances of suppressed evidence in the armorer\u2019s case. In a statement Wednesday to CNN, Morrissey said she would respond \u201cin writing\u201d to the defense motions. \u201cI have always been the subject of personal attacks from Mr. Bowles (Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorney) and Mr. Baldwin\u2019s legal team, so nothing new there,\u201d Morrissey said. The shooting, and defense attorneys\u2019 allegations The shooting happened October 21, 2021. Baldwin was on the set at a ranch outside Santa Fe practicing a \u201ccross draw\u201d with a prop gun \u2013 pulling it from a holster on the opposite side of his body from his draw hand \u2013 when it fired a live round, killing Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza. As the armorer, Gutierrez Reed was responsible for firearm safety and storage. At her\u00a0trial, prosecutors argued she repeatedly violated safety protocol and acted without caution in performing her duties, ultimately leading to Hutchins\u2019 death. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s defense attorney argued she has been scapegoated for the safety failures of film set management and other crew members. The evidence that imploded Baldwin\u2019s trial came to light last week, when a crime scene technician testified that a man had delivered a box of ammunition to the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office in March right after Gutierrez Reed\u2019s conviction. The man, Troy Teske, a retired police officer and friend of the armorer\u2019s father, told investigators he obtained the ammunition from prop supplier Seth Kenney, and believed the ammunition could be associated with the \u201cRust\u201d incident, the technician testified. However, the technician testified the items were catalogued separately from Baldwin\u2019s case and were not included in the \u201cRust\u201d case inventory or tested to see if they matched the lethal round. Baldwin\u2019s attorneys, in a filing last week asking for the case to be dismissed, claimed that this could point to \u201can external source of the live ammunition (prop supplier\u00a0Seth Kenney)\u201d on set. The Baldwin team\u2019s filing alleged prosecutors didn\u2019t disclose the evidence because it \u201cwould be favorable to Baldwin,\u201d last week\u2019s filing shows. Baldwin was unaware of the risk live ammunition had been brought to the \u201cRust\u201d set, and for prosecutors to establish a link between Baldwin and the live ammunition source, they would have to show Gutierrez Reed, the armorer, had brought the rounds to set, according to the motion filed last week. \u201cEvidence that the live rounds came from Kenney is therefore favorable to Baldwin, which is why the state buried it,\u201d last week\u2019s document states. During a chaotic, hourslong hearing Friday, investigators testified they and Morrissey determined the ammo was not relevant to the \u201cRust\u201d case and so did not turn it over to the defense. Morrissey also testified, saying investigators had determined the ammunition was not a match to those found on the \u201cRust\u201d set and had no evidentiary value. The lead investigator, however, testified the rounds looked \u201csimilar\u201d to the dummy rounds on the film\u2019s set. Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer ruled prosecutors did not properly turn over evidence to the defense. She dismissed Baldwin\u2019s case with prejudice, meaning it cannot be brought again. In Tuesday\u2019s filing, Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorneys said prosecutors \u2013 and even Gutierrez Reed\u2019s defense team itself \u2013 was aware of the ammunition Teske had before he gave it to the sheriff\u2019s office in March. Her attorneys wrote an email to Morrissey in January saying it was \u201cimportant to compare the powder of the Teske rounds to the powder in the powder in the live rounds found on the Rust set,\u201d Tuesday\u2019s filing reads. Morrissey wrote back that she didn\u2019t plan to retrieve or test the rounds, because she found them visually dissimilar and not relevant, Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorneys said in Tuesday\u2019s filing. But on Friday during Baldwin\u2019s trial, Morrissey claimed that Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorneys did not want rounds that Teske had because they incriminated their client, Tuesday\u2019s filing reads. \u201cThat is an absolute falsehood. \u2026 Far from distancing (themselves) from the Teske rounds, defense counsel recognized their potential exculpatory value had the state tested them,\u201d the court filing said. Teske had turned the rounds over to the sheriff\u2019s office in March, hoping that it would test the rounds \u201cwhile Gutierrez Reed pursued her appeal,\u201d Tuesday\u2019s filing says. \u201cInstead, the state placed them in a separate case file and attempted to hide them,\u201d Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorneys wrote in Tuesday\u2019s filing. In Tuesday\u2019s court filing, the attorneys claimed an interview with Kenney, the prop supplier, was suppressed \u2013 and that the attorneys would have used his statements in cross examination in Gutierrez Reed\u2019s trial had they known about them. In that interview, Kenney spoke about her experience and had not heard allegations that she was unsafe, among other things, the attorneys wrote. A report conducted by state firearms experts was likewise not made available to Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorneys, and the state revealed it to Baldwin\u2019s defense team only after Gutierrez Reed was convicted, Tuesday\u2019s filing says. The report said the gun used on the \u201cRust\u201d set had \u201cunexplained toolmarks on critical surfaces of the trigger and sear,\u201d Tuesday\u2019s filing says. Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorneys previously made that argument in a separate court filing, which Reuters reported on last month, asking that a court release her from prison. The firearms experts\u2019 finding is evidence that the gun could have accidentally fired and could have led to her not being found guilty in the case, Gutierrez Reed\u2019s attorney Jason Bowles said last month, according to Reuters.

{"id": "2024_07_17_us_navy-exonerates-black-sailors-port-explosion", "text": "The US Navy has exonerated 256 Black sailors who were found to be unjustly punished in 1944 following a horrific port explosion that killed hundreds of service members and exposed racist double standards among the then-segregated ranks. On July 17, 1944, munitions being loaded onto a cargo ship detonated, causing secondary blasts that ignited 5,000 tons of explosives at Port Chicago naval weapons station near San Francisco. The explosion killed 320 sailors and civilians, nearly 75% of whom were Black, and injured another 400 personnel. Surviving Black sailors had to pick up the human remains and clear the blast site while White officers were granted leave to recuperate. The pier was a critical ammunition supply site for forces in the Pacific during World War II, and the job of loading those ships was left primarily to Black enlisted sailors overseen by White officers. Before the explosion, the Black sailors working the dock had expressed concerns about the loading operations. Shortly after the blast, they were ordered to return to loading ships even though no changes had been made to improve their safety. The sailors refused, saying they needed training on how to more safely handle the bombs before they returned. What followed affected the rest of their lives, including punishments that kept them from receiving honorable discharges even as the vast majority returned to work at the pier under immense pressure and served throughout the war. Fifty sailors who held fast to their demands for safety and training were tried as a group on charges of conspiracy to commit mutiny and were convicted and sent to prison. The whole episode was unjust, and none of the sailors received the legal due process they were owed, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said in an interview with The Associated Press. It was \u201ca horrific situation for those Black sailors that remained,\u201d Del Toro said. The Navy\u2019s office of general counsel reviewed the military judicial proceedings used to punish the sailors and found \u201cthere were so many inconsistencies and so many legal violations that came to the forefront,\u201d he said. Thurgood Marshall, who was then a defense attorney for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, defended the 50 sailors who were convicted of mutiny. Marshall went on to become the first Black justice on the Supreme Court. On Wednesday, the 80th anniversary of the Port Chicago disaster, Del Toro signed paperwork officially clearing the sailors, who are now deceased. Del Toro handed the first pen to Thurgood Marshall Jr., the late justice\u2019s son. The exonerations \u201care deeply moving,\u201d Marshall Jr. said. \u201cThey, of course, are all gone, and that\u2019s a painful aspect of it. But so many fought for so long for that kind of fairness and recognition.\u201d President Joe Biden said the decision to exonerate is \u201crighting a historic wrong.\u201d In the appeal of their courts martial convictions, then-NAACP attorney Marshall wrote that \u201cjustice can only be done in this case by a complete reversal of findings,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cWith this action, we are answering that call.\u201d The events have stung surviving family members for decades, but an earlier effort in the 1990s to pardon the sailors fell short. Two additional sailors were previously cleared \u2013 one was found mentally incompetent to stand trial, and one was cleared on insufficient evidence. Wednesday\u2019s action goes beyond a pardon and vacates the military judicial proceedings carried out in 1944 against all of the men. \u201cThis decision clears their names and restores their honor and acknowledges the courage that they displayed in the face of immense danger,\u201d Del Toro said. The racism\u00a0that the Black sailors faced reflected the military\u2019s views at the time \u2013 ranks were segregated, and the Navy had only reluctantly opened some positions it considered less desirable to Black service members. The official court of inquiry looking into why the explosion occurred cleared all the White officers and praised them for the \u201cgreat effort\u201d they had to exert to run the dock. It left open the suggestion that the Black sailors were to blame for the accident. Del Toro\u2019s action converts the discharges to honorable unless there other circumstances surrounded them. After the Navy upgrades the discharges, surviving family members can work with the Department of Veterans Affairs on past benefits that may be owed, the Navy said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/us/navy-exonerates-black-sailors-port-explosion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_16_us_act-college-entrance-test-changes", "text": "Major changes are coming to the ACT college admissions exam in the spring, the CEO of ACT announced Monday. The exam will be evolving to \u201cmeet the challenges students and educators face\u201d \u2013 and that will include shortening the core test and making the science section optional, chief executive Janet Godwin said in a\u00a0post on the non-profit\u2019s website. The changes will begin with national online tests in spring 2025 and be rolled out for school-day testing in spring 2026, Godwin said in the post. The decision to alter the ACT follows changes made to the SAT earlier this year by the College Board, the non-profit organization that develops and administers that test. The SAT was shortened by a third and went fully digital. Science is being removed from the ACT\u2019s core sections, leaving English, reading and math as the portions that will result in a college-reportable composite score ranging from 1 to 36, Godwin wrote. The science section, like the ACT\u2019s writing section already was, will be optional. \u201cThis means students can choose to take the ACT, the ACT plus science, the ACT plus writing, or the ACT plus science and writing,\u201d Godwin wrote. \u201cWith this flexibility, students can focus on their strengths and showcase their abilities in the best possible way.\u201d Students who choose to take the science section will receive a standalone score for that section in addition to a STEM score that combines the math and science sections. Similarly, the optional writing section already yielded its own score. The\u00a0core ACT\u00a0exam will\u00a0be significantly shorter, down from about three hours to two hours, Godwin wrote. \u201cTo achieve this, the test will include shorter passages on the reading and English sections and fewer questions in each section \u2013 44 fewer questions in all \u2013 allowing students more time to answer each question thoughtfully,\u201d Godwin wrote. \u201cThis change is designed to make the testing experience more manageable for students, enabling them to perform at their best without the fatigue that often accompanies longer exams,\u201d she said. The cost of the exam will also go down, Godwin told CNN in an email. Approximately 60% of students who graduated in 2023 took the ACT exam at least once,\u00a0according to the organization. Last fall, the non-profit reported students\u2019 average scores had dropped for a sixth consecutive year. The class of 2023 had an average composite score of 19.5, down from 19.8 by the 2022 graduating class. And about 20.8% met all four benchmarks in English, reading, math and science in 2023, down from 22.1% in 2022, the non-profit said. Benchmarks are what the organization considers minimum scores to indicate a student\u2019s high chance of success in first-year college courses. According to a\u00a0report from Common App, 43% of college students submitted ACT or SAT scores in 2022, following a movement by colleges to make college entrance exams optional. However, some schools have reversed course, requiring students to\u00a0submit their scores again. \u201cAs ACT continues to innovate and adapt, our dedication to providing accessible, reliable, and forward-thinking readiness solutions remains steadfast, ensuring every learner has the opportunity to succeed,\u201d Godwin said in the online post. This year, the company began offering a\u00a0digital version of the exam, though students still can opt to take the ACT with paper and pencil. It also launched \u201cEncourage,\u201d which is a free college and career program. \u201cThrough this change we will provide an avenue for students to demonstrate what they know, not how fast they can tell us what they know,\u201d Godwin told CNN in an email.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/us/act-college-entrance-test-changes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_us_terrell-davis-united-flight-attendant", "text": "Terrell Davis and his family were looking forward to vacationing in California when the NFL Hall of Famer was handcuffed and removed from a United Airlines plane \u2013 for no apparent reason. \u201cI was stripped of my dignity. I was powerless. I couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d the two-time Super Bowl champion told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Wednesday. The incident happened Saturday at the end of a flight from Denver to Orange County, California. Davis, 51, was flying with his wife, two sons and daughter when one of the sons asked for a cup of ice during beverage service, Davis wrote on Instagram. A flight attendant \u201ceither didn\u2019t hear or ignored his request and continued past our row,\u201d the post read. \u201cI calmly reached behind me and lightly tapped (the attendant\u2019s) arm to get his attention to again ask for a cup of ice for my son,\u201d Davis wrote.  \u201cHe shouted, \u2018Don\u2019t hit me,\u2019 and left the cart to hurriedly approach the front of the plane. I was confused, as were the passengers in front of me who witnessed the exchange. I thought nothing of it other than this particular employee was incredibly rude and blatantly wrong in his accusations of me hitting him.\u201d Davis said he did not see or interact with the attendant for the rest of the flight. After the plane landed in Orange County, the pilot asked passengers to remain seated, and FBI and law enforcement agents went to Davis\u2019s seat, put him in handcuffs and took him off the plane \u2013 with the scene \u201crecorded by multiple passengers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy boys were there. And my daughter was there. And my wife is there,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m wondering what\u2019s going on. They didn\u2019t ask me any questions. I had no chance to even explain.\u201d Davis\u2019 wife, Tamiko Davis, said she knew her husband couldn\u2019t even question why he was being handcuffed and taken away. \u201cTerrell knows better. Unfortunately, historically, in these situations, interaction with law enforcement as a Black man \u2026 you can\u2019t ask,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cSo thank God my husband has the wherewithal, the class, the understanding to know, in that moment, all he could do was sit there and comply and be humiliated in front of his sons and the 200 \u2026 however many people were on that plane. They didn\u2019t give him any other options.\u201d Wife and kids were left \u2018to fend for ourselves\u2019 Davis said he strives to be a positive role model for his kids and teach them to do the right thing \u2013 which makes the sight of him getting taken away in handcuffs even more heartbreaking. \u201cWe did the right thing. We didn\u2019t do anything. Yet I found myself with handcuffs, being paraded off a plane and being treated like a convict,\u201d Davis said. After Davis was taken off the plane, \u201cWe were just left to fend for ourselves on a flight with everyone staring at us,\u201d his wife said told ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d earlier Wednesday. Later, \u201cDuring questioning, it was rightfully determined by the agents that this flight attendant was inaccurate in his accusations and the agents profusely apologized,\u201d Davis wrote. United Airlines has \u201cremoved the flight attendant from duty while we closely review this matter,\u201d the company said in an email to CNN Monday evening. \u201cThis is clearly not the kind of travel experience we strive to provide, and we have reached out to Mr. Davis\u2019 team to apologize,\u201d United Airlines\u2019 email read. Davis is still waiting for a direct apology from United Airlines, he told \u201cGMA\u201d Wednesday morning. \u201cThey have not reached out to me to apologize,\u201d he told ABC. \u201cThey have reached out to my attorney, but I have not heard from them directly. And so that, to me, is a problem.\u201d CNN reached out to United Airlines for comment after Davis\u2019 remarks Wednesday. \u201cWe have nothing new to share,\u201d United\u2019s media relations department said. \u2018We are held to a different standard\u2019 The Davises said they\u2019re not certain what race the flight attendant is. But they said Black men are often treated differently \u2013 and they\u2019re raising their sons to beware of that cruel reality. \u201cThe traumatizing experience of my two sons, my daughter and my wife watching me being placed in handcuffs \u2013 without due process or any explanation \u2013 cannot be undone,\u201d Davis wrote on Instagram. \u201cI certainly felt like that wouldn\u2019t have happened if I were a White person,\u201d Davis told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s what I felt. Whether that\u2019s true or not, that\u2019s a different conversation.\u201d The FBI\u2019s Los Angeles field office acknowledged Monday that agents and law enforcement partners respond to a report of an incident with a flight that landed Saturday at Orange County\u2019s John Wayne Airport. A person who was detained for questioning \u201cwas cooperative with law enforcement and was released to continue his travels,\u201d the FBI office said. The FBI does not provide details of incidents or names of people who might have been interviewed unless charges are filed publicly, FBI field office spokesperson Laura Eimiller said. What happened on the flight \u201cis appalling and disturbing to say the least,\u201d Parker Stinar, managing partner of the Chicago-based law firm representing Davis told CNN this week. \u201cWe plan on fully investigating\u00a0the events that took place and are actively contacting United Airlines in this matter,\u201d Stinar wrote. Now, instead of vacationing with his children, Davis is using his clout to raise awareness about mistreatment and hopefully \u201caffect change,\u201d he told \u201cGMA.\u201d As one of only eight running backs to have rushed more than 2,000 yards in an NFL season, Davis played seven seasons in the NFL \u2013 all with the Broncos \u2013 from 1995 to 2001, and helped the Broncos win two Super Bowls in January 1998 and January 1999. He was named MVP of that first title game, rushing for 157 yards and scoring three touchdowns in the Broncos\u2019 31-24 win over the Green Bay Packers. The three-time Pro Bowler was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017. But despite his fame, Davis said he and other Black men are often treated differently. He wants his sons to keep an open mind if they feel they\u2019re being perceived differently \u2013 \u201cI always try to go through a checklist of things that it could be, and I always try to use race as like the last sort of possible thing,\u201d Davis told CNN. \u201cBut I always tell them: What applies to everybody else doesn\u2019t apply to you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re always trying to teach them that there\u2019s consequences, but we are held to a different standard.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jason Hanna, Raja Razek, Cindy Von Quednow and Kelly McCleary contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_07_16_us_tuskegee-syphilis-study-whistleblower-peter-buxtun-death", "text": "New York (AP) \u2014 Peter Buxtun, the whistleblower who revealed that the US government allowed hundreds of Black men in rural Alabama to go untreated for syphilis in what became known as the Tuskegee study, has died. He was 86. Buxtun died May 18 of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in Rocklin, California, according to his attorney, Minna Fernan. Buxtun is revered as a hero to public health scholars and ethicists for his role in bringing to light the\u00a0most notorious medical research scandal\u00a0in US history. Documents that Buxtun provided to The Associated Press, and its subsequent investigation and reporting, led to a public outcry that ended the study in 1972. Forty years earlier, in 1932, federal scientists began studying 400 Black men in Tuskegee, Alabama, who were infected with syphilis. When antibiotics became available in the 1940s that could treat the disease, federal health officials ordered that the drugs be withheld. The study became an observation of how the disease ravaged the body over time. In the mid-1960s, Buxtun was a federal public health employee working in San Francisco when he overheard a co-worker talking about the study. The research wasn\u2019t exactly a secret \u2014 about a dozen medical journal articles about it had been published in the previous 20 years. But hardly anyone had raised any concerns about how the experiment was being conducted. \u201cThis study was completely accepted by the American medical community,\u201d said Ted Pestorius of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, speaking at a 2022 program marking the 50th anniversary of the end of the study. Buxtun had a different reaction. After learning more about the study, he raised ethical concerns in a 1966 letter to officials at the CDC. In 1967, he was summoned to a meeting in Atlanta, where he was chewed out by agency officials for what they deemed to be impertinence. Repeatedly, agency leaders rejected his complaints and his call for the men in Tuskegee to be treated. He left the US Public Health Service and attended law school, but the study ate at him. In 1972, he provided documents about the research to Edith Lederer, an AP reporter he had met in San Francisco. Lederer passed the documents to AP investigative reporter Jean Heller, telling her colleague, \u201cI think there might be something here.\u201d Heller\u2019s story was published on July 25, 1972, leading to congressional hearings, a class-action lawsuit that resulted in a $10 million\u00a0settlement\u00a0and the study\u2019s termination about four months later. In 1997, President Bill Clinton formally\u00a0apologized\u00a0for the study, calling it \u201cshameful.\u201d The leader of a group dedicated to the memory of the study participants said Monday they are grateful to Buxtun for exposing the experiment. \u201cWe are thankful for his honesty and his courage,\u201d said Lille Tyson Head, whose father was in the study. Buxtun was born in Prague in 1937. His father was Jewish, and his family immigrated to the US in 1939 from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, eventually settling in Irish Bend, Oregon, on the Columbia River. In his complaints to federal health officials, he drew comparisons between the Tuskegee study and medical experiments Nazi doctors had conducted on Jews and other prisoners. Federal scientists didn\u2019t believe they were guilty of the same kind of moral and ethical sins, but after the Tuskegee study was exposed, the\u00a0government put in place new rules\u00a0about how it conducts medical research. Today, the study is often blamed for the unwillingness of some African Americans to participate in medical research. \u201cPeter\u2019s life experiences led him to immediately identify the study as morally indefensible and to seek justice in the form of treatment for the men. Ultimately, he could not relent,\u201d said the CDC\u2019s Pestorius. Buxtun attended the University of Oregon, served in the US Army as a combat medic and psychiatric social worker and joined the federal health service in 1965. Buxtun went on to write, give presentations and win awards for his involvement in the Tuskegee study. A global traveler, he collected and sold antiques, especially military weapons and swords and gambling equipment from California\u2019s Gold Rush era. He also spent more than 20 years trying to recover his family\u2019s properties confiscated by the Nazis and was partly successful. \u201cPeter was wise, witty, classy and unceasingly generous,\u201d said David M. Golden, a close friend of Buxtun\u2019s for over 25 years. \u201cHe was a staunch advocate for personal freedoms and spoke often against prohibition, whether it be drugs, prostitution or firearms.\u201d Another longtime friend, Angie Bailie, said she attended many of Buxtun\u2019s presentations about Tuskegee. \u201cPeter never ended a single talk without fighting back tears,\u201d she said Buxtun himself could be self-effacing about his actions, saying he did not anticipate the vitriolic reaction of some health officials when he started questioning the study\u2019s ethics. At a Johns Hopkins University forum in 2018, Buxtun was asked where he got the moral strength to blow the whistle. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t strength,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was stupidity.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/us/tuskegee-syphilis-study-whistleblower-peter-buxtun-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_us_thomas-crooks-trump-rally-shooting-invs", "text": "In the 48 hours before he opened fire on former President Donald Trump, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks made a series of stops in and around his suburban Pittsburgh hometown. On Friday, he went to a shooting range where he was a member, and practiced firing, a law enforcement official told CNN. The next morning, Crooks went to a Home Depot, where he bought a five-foot ladder, and a gun store, where he purchased 50 rounds of ammunition, the official said. Then, Crooks drove his Hyundai Sonata about an hour north, joining thousands of people from around the region who flocked to Trump\u2019s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. He parked the car outside the rally, with an improvised explosive device hidden in the trunk that was wired to a transmitter he carried, the official said. Then, investigators believe, he used his newly-bought ladder to scale a nearby building, and opened fire on the former president. As investigators continue to search for a motive behind the attempted assassination, they are scrutinizing Crooks\u2019 movements before the attack and trying to piece together a timeline of his actions leading up to it. Yet nearly 48 hours after the shooting, investigators are struck by the lack of leads they\u2019re finding about Crooks\u2019 mindset\u00a0and possible motives. Even after successfully breaking into his phone and\u00a0searching\u00a0his computer, scouring his search history and bedroom, and interviewing his family and friends, agents still haven\u2019t found\u00a0evidence\u00a0that would suggest\u00a0political or ideological\u00a0impetus for the shooting, law enforcement sources told CNN. Instead, the evidence they have found appears\u00a0to\u00a0show typical online activities including an interest in computer coding and gaming, the sources said\u00a0\u2014 and\u00a0that\u00a0has raised more questions. In a sign that his attack could have been even more destructive, Crooks had a remote control detonator on his body, and his car\u2019s trunk contained a metal box of explosives that was connected with wires to a receiver, the law enforcement source said. That suggests the gunman may have been planning to set off an explosion remotely, and investigators are considering the theory that he may have been planning a distraction during the shooting. It\u2019s unclear how Crooks assembled the explosive\u00a0devices found\u00a0in his car. Investigators parsing through his online search history haven\u2019t found any indication of him researching how to make home-made explosives, law enforcement officials said. The AR-style rifle Crooks used to fire on Trump was legally purchased by his father, Matthew Crooks. It was one of more than 20 firearms registered to the elder Crooks, which were kept at the family\u2019s home, according to Pennsylvania State Police records reviewed by investigators, the official said. All of the guns were legally purchased. The gunman and his father were members of Clairton Sportsmen\u2019s Club, a gun club about a 25-minute drive from his house, and enjoyed going shooting there together, according to law enforcement officials. Rob Bootay, a lawyer for the club, confirmed in a statement that the younger Crooks was a member. The club, which has about 2,000 members, features a rifle shooting range that is roughly 200 yards long, according to a CNN analysis of satellite images \u2013 longer than the distance between Crooks and Trump when he fired at the former president while perched on a nearby rooftop. The range is tucked into 180 acres of woodlands in the hills south of Pittsburgh. \u201cThe Club fully admonishes the senseless act of violence that occurred,\u201d Bootay said, adding that he could not \u201cmake any additional commentary in relation to this matter in light of pending law enforcement investigations.\u201d Crooks purchased the 50 rounds of ammunition on the morning of the attack at Allegheny Arms and Gun Works, a local gun store in his hometown of Bethel Park, a senior law enforcement official told CNN. Bruce Piendl, the store\u2019s owner, said in a statement that \u201cwe are thankful that President Trump was not assassinated and our hearts and prayers go out to all victims of this horrible incident.\u201d A spokesperson for Home Depot, where Crooks bought the ladder, said in a statement that \u201cwe condemn the violence against former President Trump, and our thoughts are with him, the other victims of Saturday\u2019s horrific events, and their families.\u201d It\u2019s not clear whether Crooks used the ammunition or the ladder that he bought on Saturday during his attack later that day. Matthew Crooks did not respond to requests for comment from CNN on Sunday and Monday. On Saturday evening, before officials had publicly confirmed his son\u2019s role in the attack, he told CNN that he was trying to figure out \u201cwhat the hell is going on\u201d but would \u201cwait until I talk to law enforcement\u201d before speaking about his son. FBI investigators succeeded in accessing the younger Crooks\u2019 cell phone, the agency said Monday afternoon. While investigators had hoped that breakthough would help them understand what drove him to attempt to assassinate Trump, they\u2019re still struggling to make sense of it, law enforcement officials said. The shooter\u2019s parents, who have been cooperating with law enforcement since the shooting, have told investigators that Crooks did not appear to have friends and did not appear to have any political leanings, a law enforcement official told CNN. But they didn\u2019t seem to know much about what was going on in his life recently, law enforcement sources said.

{"id": "2024_07_14_us_texas-houston-hurricane-beryl-damage", "text": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott threatened to issue an executive order forcing electricity provider CenterPoint Energy to improve the reliability of its equipment and its level of storm preparedness if the company fails to address his concerns in the wake of deadly Hurricane Beryl. If CenterPoint does not comply with his request or provide sufficient information by July 31, the governor would \u201cimpose my own requirements on CenterPoint that are geared to keep power on through hurricane season until the next legislative session,\u201d Abbott said at a Sunday news conference. Power was knocked out in Houston and areas along the Texas Gulf Coast last Monday after the Category 1 hurricane, which left at least 10 dead. A week later, thousands are still waiting for power to be restored. People in southeast Texas have endured several days of hot weather without air conditioning as many look for safe drinking water, food and cool shelters. A 71-year-old woman near Crystal Beach died after her oxygen machine ran out of battery power and her generator shut down. Two deaths in the Houston area were attributed to carbon monoxide poisoning, and fire departments received more than 200 carbon monoxide poisoning calls, local officials said, warning residents to use generators safely amid the outages. The Public Utilities Commission of Texas will investigate CenterPoint Energy\u2019s response to the power outages, according to Chairman Thomas Gleeson. The power company\u2019s ability to maintain its infrastructure and its communication with customers has been called into question, Gleeson said at a Monday news conference. \u201cI\u2019ve also committed that we will bring to the legislature and the governor more long-term fixes to address these issues that will probably need statutory change,\u201d he said. CNN has reached out to CenterPoint officials for comment on the governor\u2019s statement and the new state investigation. Hundreds of thousands still without power More than 151,000 homes and businesses were without power across Texas Monday night, and more than 135,000 of those are CenterPoint customers, according to PowerOutage.us. As of Monday night, CenterPoint said it had restored power to 2.1 million customers since Beryl hit, according to its website. The company expects to have electricity back by Friday for all people who can receive power, it said in a Monday update that added the company had restored 92% of customers so far. \u201cWe are grateful to our crews who have restored power to our customers at a stronger pace than we have been able to in any hurricane in our history, despite the difficult conditions,\u201d Lynnae Wilson, the utility\u2019s senior vice president of electric business, said in the update. The governor called power companies\u2019 failure to provide their customers with power \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d The governor singled out CenterPoint as having \u201crepeatedly failed to deliver power to customers for extended periods.\u201d \u201cI will work with legislators to craft laws to improve power reliability, but, and here\u2019s the important part, we are still in hurricane season right now, and solutions cannot wait until the next session,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cThey are needed now to minimize power disruptions as we respond to tropical weather for the remainder of the summer and this fall, to help avoid more power outages during the remainder of hurricane season.\u201d \u201cAlso, if CenterPoint does not comply, I will demand that the Public Utilities Commission reject CenterPoint\u2019s request to recover a profit and pending request before the public utilities commission,\u201d the governor added. Abbott also noted the utility admitted many of the outages caused by the hurricane were related to trees falling on power lines. \u201cCenterPoint is responsible for eliminating the vegetation before a hurricane hits,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cSome reports show that CenterPoint spends far less per customer on vegetation removal than some other power providers.\u201d The governor demanded the utility company eliminate all vegetation issues by the end of August. Abbott also noted the company claimed to have assembled thousands of additional lineman and other personnel to speed up the recovery process. However, he said some reports said many of those workers were slow to respond for various reasons. \u201cOne was training workers after the hurricane hit, rather than training those workers before the hurricane hit,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cAnother was positioning workers days after the hurricane was gone, rather than positioning those workers immediately after the hurricane left.\u201d He said the commission could reconsider the size of CenterPoint\u2019s territorial region if the company can\u2019t fix its ongoing issues. \u201cMaybe they have too large of an area for them to be able to manage adequately. It\u2019s time to reevaluate whether or not CenterPoint should have such a large territory,\u201d Abbott said. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick also criticized the utility company at Sunday\u2019s news conference, saying the jobs of any CenterPoint employee, \u201cwhether you\u2019re at the top or any part of management who oversaw this response or preparation,\u201d would be on the line. \u201cI know everyone at CenterPoint who\u2019s in an air-conditioned office is watching; a freight train\u2019s coming. You just heard it. You better be prepared,\u201d Patrick said.\u00a0\u201cWe will not and cannot tolerate this.\u201d In its statement, CenterPoint said, \u201cOur top priority is restoring power to the remaining impacted customers as safely and quickly as possible. Dedicated restoration crews have continued working around-the-clock through the weekend, restoring power at the fastest rate in the company\u2019s history.\u201d The utility acknowledged customers\u2019 growing frustrations and committed to a review of its response for customers without power. \u201cWe have heard and understand our customers\u2019 frustrations, and we are committed to working together with the State, local government, regulators, and community leaders both to help the Greater Houston area recover from Hurricane Beryl and to improve for the future,\u201d the utility said. The Texas power grid was also a focal point in February 2021, after a massive statewide outage during a deep freeze left more than 200 people dead and millions without heat and power for days. The state\u2019s government has worked with local officials over the last week to provide ready-to-eat meals for people who have lost electricity in their homes, Abbott said. Officials are also working to ensure people have adequate water supplies and ice, and are addressing the ongoing medical needs at hospitals and health care facilities, according to the governor. \u201cMeals have been lost because people have not had the power on in their house or apartment, and as a result, their food has spoiled \u2026 because of lack of power,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lack of power is because of CenterPoint.\u201d CNN\u2019s Amy Simonson, Steve Almasy, Dalia Faheid\u00a0and\u00a0Taylor Galgano contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/us/texas-houston-hurricane-beryl-damage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_biden-democratic-advisers-campaign", "text": "As President Joe Biden flies back to Delaware from Las Vegas on Wednesday night, cutting his trip short after testing positive for Covid-19, he faces one of the most momentous decisions of his long political life: Should he heed the rising calls from his fellow Democrats to extinguish his bid for reelection? For Biden, is it a new moment? Even though anger and panic\u00a0have\u00a0been steadily rising inside the Democratic Party for nearly three weeks, after\u00a0the president\u2019s\u00a0alarming debate performance in Atlanta, the White House and the Biden campaign are in a new place, multiple Democratic officials told CNN. \u201cThe private conversations with the Hill are continuing,\u201d a senior Democratic adviser told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating the campaign and the White House. \u201cHe\u2019s being receptive. Not as defiant as he is publicly.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s gone from saying, \u2018Kamala can\u2019t win,\u2019 to \u2018Do you think Kamala can win? \u201c the adviser said. \u201cIt\u2019s still unclear where he\u2019s going to land but seems to be listening. The Biden campaign, which is also facing a growing outcry from Democratic donors, dismissed the suggestion the president was rethinking his candidacy. \u201cIf the facts matter \u2013 and they should \u2013 here is one: President Biden is the Democratic nominee and he is going to win this November,\u201d Kevin Munoz, a Biden spokesman, told CNN. The developments come at a crucial time for the Biden campaign. ABC News\u2019 Jonathan Karl reported earlier Wednesday that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told Biden on Saturday that it would be best if Biden bowed out of the presidential race. In a statement responding to the ABC News reporting, a Schumer spokesperson said, \u201cUnless ABC\u2019s source is Senator Chuck\u00a0Schumer\u00a0or President Joe Biden the reporting is idle speculation. Leader\u00a0Schumer\u00a0conveyed the views of his caucus directly to President Biden on Saturday.\u201d What that statement did not say, however, was three important words that Schumer has included every time he is asked whether Biden\u2019s candidacy should proceed: \u201cI\u2019m with Joe.\u201d The private meeting between Schumer and Biden, which was held at the president\u2019s beach house Saturday in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, is seen by Democratic officials as one of the most important moments in this escalating drama. Earlier Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff, who\u2019s running for Senate in California, became the latest high profile member of Biden\u2019s party to call on the president to exit the race, the first congressional Democrat to do so publicly following the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump.

The child\u2019s father, Avraham\u00a0Chaitovsky, 28, was charged with endangering the welfare of a child,\u00a0according to the\u00a0release. Chaitovsky\u00a0was taken into custody, said the prosecutor. He has since been released,\u00a0Ocean County Jail\u00a0records show.\u00a0It\u2019s unclear whether\u00a0he\u00a0has retained an attorney. In another incident, a 2-year-old girl in Arizona died after being left in a vehicle in her family\u2019s driveway for about three hours, according to the Marana Police Department. The girl\u2019s father,\u00a037-year-old\u00a0Christopher Scholtes,\u00a0told officers he\u00a0arrived home on July 9 and left his daughter sleeping in her car seat inside the vehicle, which\u00a0he said\u00a0was running with the AC on, according to a news release from police. Scholtes\u00a0\u201ctold detectives he did not want to wake his daughter\u00a0up,\u201d the release said. When her mother arrived home, the girl was found in the car \u2013 which was no longer running \u2013 and\u00a0the\u00a0air conditioning\u00a0was off. The mother performed CPR until first responders arrived. The child was taken to Banner University Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead, police said. Detectives used surveillance video from neighbors to determine the girl was left in the vehicle for about three hours, police said. The area was under an excessive heat warning from the National Weather Service in Tucson\u00a0at the time. And in Nebraska, a 5-year-old boy died on July 10 after being\u00a0found unresponsive inside a vehicle, according to the Omaha Police Department. The boy was left unattended inside the vehicle for\u00a0\u201can extended period of time,\u201d\u00a0police said\u00a0in a news release. His foster mother, 40-year-old Juanita Pinon,\u00a0has been charged with child abuse by neglect, resulting in death, and booked into Douglas County Corrections\u00a0with bond set at $2 million, according to\u00a0county court records. CNN has reached out to an attorney for Pinon for comment. Heat safety warning Children left unattended in cars are at risk for heat stroke and possibly death \u2013 and it\u2019s not enough to just crack a window,\u00a0the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. \u201cTemperatures inside the car can rise almost 20 degrees Fahrenheit within the first 10 minutes, even with a window cracked open\u201d\u00a0and even when it feels cool outside,\u00a0the agency warns. About 1,220 people in the United States are killed by extreme heat every year, according to the CDC. On\u00a0average,\u00a037 children under the age of 15 die each year from heatstroke after being left in a vehicle, according to the\u00a0National Safety Council. With summer off to a scorching start, health officials are reminding people to take extra care in preventing heat-related illnesses. That includes never leaving a child, disabled person\u00a0or pet unattended in a\u00a0car, watching for signs of heat stroke and drinking plenty of water.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/us/hot-car-deaths-charges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_media_secret-service-agents-women-trump-shooting", "text": "In the days following the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, the Secret Service, charged with securing the Pennsylvania event, has faced scrutiny for the extraordinary breach that led to the agency\u2019s worst failure in decades. But one narrative has quickly taken hold in parts of the right-wing media ecosystem:\u00a0The security failure was the result of workforce diversity initiatives and\u00a0women working as\u00a0Secret Service agents. While the security lapse happened outside of the event\u2019s hard perimeter at a poorly secured building roughly 120 to 150 meters away from the stage, prominent right-wing figures have launched misogynistic attacks, blaming the female agents positioned near Trump as well as Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, the\u00a0second woman to hold the top job\u00a0and\u00a0an advocate for women to join the force. In the seconds after shots rang out Saturday, male and\u00a0female agents\u00a0positioned\u00a0on stage with Trump sprang into action to protect the former president with their own bodies.\u00a0But in a series of social media posts and television appearances,\u00a0right-wing\u00a0media pundits\u00a0have\u00a0targeted the\u00a0female agents\u2019 response, claiming they\u00a0lacked the experience, size, and capability to\u00a0handle the situation.\u00a0Edited videos\u00a0that garnered millions of views\u00a0on social media\u00a0as supposed evidence of female incompetence,\u00a0showed a female Secret Service agent seemingly struggling to holster her gun amid\u00a0the\u00a0chaotic scene as a group of\u00a0agents\u00a0escorted Trump to his motorcade. Groups that represent women in law enforcement are also raising the alarm, saying such attacks are dangerous and disingenuous. Matt Walsh, a far-right media personality, wrote a series of posts on the social media platform X\u00a0assailing the notion of\u00a0women working as Secret Service agents. \u201cThere should not be any women in the Secret Service. These are supposed to be the very best, and none of the very best at this job are women,\u201d he wrote. Walsh, who has advocated for traditional gender roles,\u00a0claimed\u00a0without evidence\u00a0that\u00a0if any woman is hired\u00a0in the Secret Service, \u201cit 100 percent means that a more qualified male was passed over.\u201d But those experienced in federal law enforcement note that the female agents on Trump\u2019s detail acted swiftly along with their male counterparts. \u201cOne female agent joined the phalanx in shielding Trump from any possible additional incoming rounds, while another female agent with her gun drawn provided rear security,\u201d said Josh Campbell, former FBI supervisory special agent and CNN security correspondent. \u201cFemale agents were also among those guarding Trump\u2019s armored SUV as it prepared to depart the scene,\u201d said Campbell. Law enforcement experts say there is usually no hurry to holster a weapon, as doing so inherently means a firearm is not required to address a potential threat. The holstering process is also a moment where plain-clothes agents in particular must take care to ensure their trigger does not snag on a piece of loose clothing. Barbara Riggs, former deputy director of the Secret Service, called the criticism directed at female agents \u201cpreposterous, \u201ccrazy,\u201d and \u201cjust outrageous.\u201d The agents on stage acted according to their training, Riggs told CNN, communicating with each other about where they were escorting Trump despite a chaotic scene. They \u201cshould be commended, not vilified,\u201d she said. Right-wing media figures have bashed diversity initiatives for years, making \u201cDEI\u201d or \u201cDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\u201d a slur in the right-wing media ecosystem,\u00a0falsely\u00a0claiming that standards have been lowered to accommodate diverse hiring\u00a0practices. Everything from the Baltimore bridge collapse to safety issues in airliners has been placed at the feet of increasing diversity among the workforce. Women have been part of the Secret Service since 1971. All agents, male or female, must\u00a0meet the same standards to join the force, although women candidates have different physical fitness requirements. By nature, security details are privy to the most personal and intimate details of a protectee\u2019s life \u2013 including\u00a0any\u00a0women being guarded \u2013 and the presence of\u00a0women\u00a0on Secret Service details has been a staple for decades. In the immediate moments following the shooting, audio captured by Trump\u2019s microphone showed\u00a0agents\u00a0taking cover with Trump behind a lectern remained in place at\u00a0the scene until it was clear the shooter was down. But some on the right criticized the female agents as physically incapable of covering Trump\u2019s body\u00a0as he reached in the air to pump his fist in a sign of defiance to his supporters. \u201cHaving a small person as body cover for a large man is like an undersized Speedo at the beach \u2013 doesn\u2019t cover the subject,\u201d X owner Elon Musk, who later endorsed Trump and dedicated millions to his\u00a0reelection\u00a0effort,\u00a0wrote on the platform. \u201cCould be a man or a woman, to be clear, just needs to be large enough to do the job.\u201d But\u00a0even Musk, who travels with personal security,\u00a0has often been spotted with male guards noticeably shorter than him.\u00a0 On Fox News, host Laura Ingraham said that while she supports women,\u00a0\u201cwhen it comes to shielding the body of someone who is six-foot-three \u2026 you can\u2019t do it if you\u2019re five-foot-five. You can\u2019t do it.\u201d Riggs, who retired from the Secret Service in 2006, said the idea agents need to be bigger than the protectee is \u201cabsurd,\u201d noting that throughout the Secret Service\u2019s history there have been male agents of varying heights, which was never an issue. But the security failures at Trump\u2019s rally stem from a building outside of the perimeter that was being secured by local law enforcement, where the shooter managed to reach the roof and have a clear line of sight to Trump. The threat to Trump was not feet in front of him, where the female agents who were most scrutinized were located. And most of the agents with Trump that day were men. One notable voice on the right defended the female agents who protected Trump at the rally. Eric Trump, the former president\u2019s son, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Tuesday that, \u201cThe people on that stage love him. They would take a bullet for him.\u201d \u201cOne of the females on the stage, she was with me for three years.\u00a0I know everything about her. She would take a bullet for me. She would take a bullet for him. As courageous as they come,\u201d he added. \u201cThe same as everybody else that was around him, the head of his detail was on that stage. Believe me, the last thing they wanted was that to happen and they did all the right things.\u201d Still, other right-wing figures blamed\u00a0DEI\u00a0initiatives for incompetence at the federal agency led by Cheatle, only the second woman to head the Secret Service. Cheatle, who has served in the Secret Service for more than 25 years and was part of then-Vice President\u00a0Joe\u00a0Biden\u2019s security detail,\u00a0previously\u00a0led global security for PepsiCo. In a\u00a0CBS News interview\u00a0last year, she said that\u00a0the agency\u00a0had sought to boost the number of women in the force. \u201cI\u2019m very conscious as I sit in this chair now, of making sure that we need to attract diverse candidates and ensure that we are developing and giving opportunities to everybody in our workforce, and particularly women,\u201d Cheatle said. Right wing\u00a0figures also attacked Cheatle\u2019s previous work as head of security at PepsiCo, one of the largest food and beverage companies in the world. Tennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett, who has attacked Vice President Kamala Harris as a \u201cDEI\u201d hire in a \u201cbox checking White House,\u201d\u00a0wrote on X, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that a DEI hire from @pepsi would be a bad choice as the head of the Secret Service. #sarcasm.\u201d On the far-right cable channel One America News, host Dan Ball claimed Cheatle \u201chas been too worried about making sure all of the agents use the proper pronouns\u201d over ensuring the safety of the former president. Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, who sits on the Senate Homeland Security Committee,\u00a0told the Washington Post on Wednesday that he believes Cheatle \u201cwas far more concerned about DEI than protecting, for example, President Trump.\u201d Riggs said Cheatle did \u201cnot get that job as a token. It\u2019s because they bring the experience, and they\u2019ve been successful.\u201d She also defended recruitment efforts, noting that more diversity brings \u201cdifferent perspectives to the table and different experiences\u201d that can help view a situation in a different way, with unique skills, knowledge and abilities. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Whitney Wild on Tuesday, Cheatle\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cWhat happened is a terrible incident and should never happen.\u201d \u201cAnd we are obviously going to make sure moving forward we take whatever any lessons that come out of this and adjust accordingly,\u201d she added. Associations that represent women in law enforcement reacted to the\u00a0unfounded attacks on female agents\u00a0with disappointment and alarm. \u201cStatements blaming this shooting on efforts to promote gender equity are disingenuous at best and deeply dangerous at worst,\u201d a group of associations, including Women in Federal Law Enforcement, International Association of Women Police, and National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives, said in a statement. Research, they said, has shown that efforts to expand the pool of qualified applicants for law enforcement positions \u201cmakes us all safer and say they do not advocate for hiring solely based on gender or lowering standards in any way.\u201d \u201cWe must reject all bad-faith efforts to seek to score political points at the expense of our safety. This is the most recent effort to sow division and blame by attacking diversity initiatives for everything from airline safety catastrophes to bridge collapse to bank failures,\u201d the groups said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/media/secret-service-agents-women-trump-shooting/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_economy_donald-trump-jerome-powell", "text": "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would not fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell if the former president wins the election in November, according to a Bloomberg interview published Tuesday. But Trump\u2019s statement wasn\u2019t exactly a promise, saying he\u2019d let Powell finish up his second term, \u201cespecially if I thought he was doing the right thing.\u201d Of course, his statement also assumes it would be technically possible for a sitting president to oust any Fed official. Powell, a registered Republican, was first tapped to helm the central bank by Trump in 2017. Trump sang Powell\u2019s praises at the time, saying \u201che\u2019s strong, he\u2019s committed, he\u2019s smart.\u201d Trump doesn\u2019t have that same rosy view of his central bank appointee any more and has repeatedly attacked the current Fed chief, even accusing him earlier this year of planning to cut interest rates just to help Democratic politicians win elections (though there isn\u2019t any evidence of that). The former president has made it clear he will not reappoint Powell if he clinches the White House in November. Trump\u2019s ire toward Powell goes as far back as 2018 when the Fed raised rates, which sparked chatter even then as to whether or not Trump could even fire Powell. However, if Trump changes his mind outright because he thinks Powell isn\u2019t doing \u201cthe right thing\u201d and does try to remove him, it could kick off a messy uphill battle. The law states that a sitting president can dismiss any Fed official, but only for \u201ccause,\u201d not because of policy differences. That still wouldn\u2019t stop Trump from pushing to oust Powell before the Fed head\u2019s term concludes in 2026. Powell\u2019s willingness to fight back through the courts would also be key in determining whether or not a president does have the power to fire the Fed chair, which would eventually reach the nation\u2019s highest court. \u201cOne of the few Supreme Court precedents on the president\u2019s authority to fire a member of a body created by Congress came from William Humphrey, an aggrieved conservative commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission, who was fired by Franklin Roosevelt in 1933 over policy differences,\u201d the Brookings Institution wrote in a 2018 analysis. \u201cHe sued for reinstatement and even though he died while the litigation was pending, the Supreme Court still\u00a0took up\u00a0his case. (This is why the case is called\u00a0Humphrey\u2019s Executor: His estate carried on after Mr. Humphrey\u2019s demise.) The estate won. The Supreme Court would have to decide whether the same logic applies to the chair of the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors.\u201d The Fed is an independent government institution, guided by its two mandates of price stability and maximum employment. It answers to Congress, not the US president, according to the law that established the central bank. The only influence the president has over the Fed is the ability to appoint the seven officials who serve on the central bank\u2019s board of governors, including the chair, which is still subject to approval by the US Senate.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/economy/donald-trump-jerome-powell/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "us"}}

Daniel Callihan was indicted by a grand jury on seven counts \u2013 capital murder in the death of the 4-year-old; two counts of kidnapping; three counts of sexual battery; and possession of a stolen vehicle, court papers filed June 28 in Mississippi\u2019s Hinds County show. A woman accused of being his accomplice, Victoria Cox, also was indicted in the children\u2019s cases, including capital murder in the 4-year-old\u2019s death; kidnapping; and sexual battery. Louisiana authorities accuse Callihan, 36, of killing the children\u2019s mother, Callie Brunett, at her home in Loranger, Louisiana, last month, abducting the two girls and taking them to Mississippi. On June 13, the 4-year-old girl was found dead and the 6-year-old was found injured but alive on a property in Jackson, Mississippi, authorities said. Both Callihan and Cox, who were arrested in Mississippi on June 13 and June 14, respectively, also were indicted on state charges in Louisiana last month, and Callihan additionally faces federal charges. An attorney representing Callihan on the charges in Louisiana told CNN he could not comment on the indictment in Mississippi. CNN could not locate legal representation for Callihan in Mississippi. Cox\u2019s Hinds County public defender, Christopher Routh, told CNN in an emailed statement:\u00a0\u201cAn\u00a0indictment is nothing more than\u00a0a\u00a0formal charge\u00a0and is no indication of guilt or culpability. Every person charged or accused of a crime in this country is presumed\u00a0innocent. Ms. Cox maintains\u00a0her\u00a0innocence\u00a0and will plead not guilty at her arraignment.\u201d Authorities in Louisiana had found Brunett dead in her Loranger home, and then issued an Amber Alert June 13 for her daughters, who were missing. Hours after the Amber Alert, law enforcement in Jackson, Mississippi \u2013 some 130 miles north of Brunett\u2019s Louisiana home \u2013 arrested Callihan in a wooded area near a Jackson house and authorities found the body of the 4-year-old, authorities said. The 6-year-old was found injured and was taken to a hospital, police said. Investigators said the wooded area, which had small cages and small wiring enclosures, could be tied to human trafficking. Investigators believed Callihan had dated Brunett \u201coff and on,\u201d Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office Chief Jimmy Travis said last month. A\u00a0GoFundMe campaign created \u201cin loving support of the Brunett family in a time of unimaginable suffering\u201d has raised more than $62,000. Charges in Louisiana In Louisiana, a grand jury indicted Callihan on June 20 with two counts of first-degree murder \u2013 one in the death of Brunett and one in the death of the 4-year-old, according to court documents filed in Louisiana\u2019s Tangipahoa Parish. He also was charged there with aggravated kidnapping of a child and second degree kidnapping. The Louisiana grand jury also indicted Cox on a count each of first-degree murder, aggravated kidnaping of a child, second-degree kidnapping of a child, and accessory after the fact in first degree murder, according to Scott Perrilloux, district attorney for a judicial district that includes Tangipahoa Parish. Louisiana will seek the death penalty against Callihan for the two first-degree murder counts, according to court documents filed Friday in Tangipahoa Parish. Callihan pleaded not guilty to his Louisiana state charges on Monday, according to court documents. CNN has sought comment from Callihan\u2019s attorney. Callihan also has been charged in federal court in Louisiana\u2019s eastern district with kidnapping and transportation with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity.

{"id": "2024_07_17_tech_amazon-warehouses-prime-day-injuries-senate", "text": "Amazon\u2019s warehouses are especially dangerous for workers during the company\u2019s annual Prime Day event, as well as the holiday season, according to an investigation by the US Senate. Prime Day, held on Tuesday and Wednesday this week, is \u201ca major cause of injuries for the warehouse workers who make it possible,\u201d said a report released Monday by Sen. Bernie Sanders, who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. The report noted \u201cthe extremely unsafe conditions in Amazon warehouses\u201d during the two peak periods and called on the company to do more to protect warehouse workers. During its ongoing investigation, the committee found that Prime Day and the holiday season at Amazon (AMZN) are characterized by an \u201cextremely high volume\u201d of work and \u201cintense pressure to work long hours and ignore safety guidelines.\u201d The report makes public, for the first time, the company\u2019s internal data on warehouse injury rates. The data shows that during Prime Day 2019 the rate of \u201crecordable\u201d injuries \u2014 those Amazon is required to disclose to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \u2014 exceeded 10 per 100 workers, more than double the average in the US warehousing and storage industry. But Amazon\u2019s total injury rate, which includes injuries the company does not have to report to OSHA, was just under 45 per 100 workers, the report said. \u201cThese injury rates are especially egregious in light of the incredible revenue the company generates and the resources it has available to make its warehouses safe for workers,\u201d it added. Amazon raked in $12.7 billion in sales on July 11 and 12 last year, its Prime Day 2023 event, and said July 11 was the single biggest sales day in the company\u2019s history. For the first three months of 2024, the e-commerce giant reported a profit of $10.4 billion. \u201cThe safety and health of our employees is and always will be our top priority,\u201d Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson, told CNN in a statement. \u201cAnd since 2019, we\u2019ve made significant progress \u2014 reducing our recordable incident rate (which includes anything that requires more than basic first aid) in the US by 28%.\u201d The spokesperson also took issue with the total injury rate cited in the Senate report, saying it had come from a five-year-old internal document that had \u201cflawed methodology and gaps in the research\u201d and which was \u201crejected by experts who specialize in data analysis.\u201d The spokesperson added: \u201cOne of the false claims in the report implies that we\u2019re not adequately staffed for busy shopping periods. This is just not true, as we carefully plan and staff up for major events, ensure that we have excess capacity across our network, and design our network so that orders are automatically routed to sites that can handle unexpected spikes in volume.\u201d Over the years, some Amazon workers have described the \u201cgrueling\u201d experience of long hours racing around warehouses that can be the\u00a0size of 28 football fields\u00a0while the company tracks their every move. In a letter to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy last year, Sanders wrote: \u201cAmazon must stop pushing workers past their limits\u2026 In its endless pursuit of profits, Amazon sacrifices workers\u2019 bodies under the constant pressure of a surveillance system that enforces impossible rates (of work). When faced with worker injuries, Amazon provides minimal medical care.\u201d Amazon holds Prime Day in July every year to\u00a0juice sales numbers\u00a0during what are typically slow summer months.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/tech/amazon-warehouses-prime-day-injuries-senate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_politics_adam-schiff-joe-biden-congress", "text": "Rep. Adam Schiff on Wednesday became the most prominent elected Democrat to publicly call on President Joe Biden to drop out of the race. The announcement by Schiff, who is running for US Senate in California, makes him the first Democrat to urge Biden to step aside since the failed assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump over the weekend. Schiff\u2019s call also is notable as he, unlike many of the other Democrats who have so far publicly called for Biden to drop out, is not in a swing district and he is close to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \u201cWhile the choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden\u2019s alone, I believe it is time for him to pass the torch. And in doing so, secure his legacy of leadership by allowing us to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming election,\u201d Schiff said in a statement. The California Democrat served as an impeachment manager during one of Trump\u2019s impeachments and has been one of the sharpest critics of the former president. In his statement, Schiff praised Biden\u2019s legacy but added, \u201cour nation is at a crossroads.\u201d \u201cA second Trump presidency will undermine the very foundation of our democracy, and I have serious concerns about whether the President can defeat Donald Trump in November,\u201d he continued. Previously, in the aftermath of Biden\u2019s disastrous performance in the CNN debate last month, Schiff would only go so far as to say the president \u201cshould take a moment to make the best-informed judgment\u201d about the future of his campaign. A Biden campaign official responded to the call from Schiff by pointing to a\u00a0July 8 letter from Biden to congressional Democrats noting his intention to stay in the race, along with his support from Democratic lawmakers, like Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Nanette Barragan, among others. The Democratic Party remains roiled about the path forward amid fears that, in light of the debate, Biden cannot defeat Trump and he risks taking down-ballot Democrats with him in November. Earlier Wednesday, CNN reported that the Democratic National Committee\u00a0is\u00a0moving ahead with\u00a0its\u00a0controversial\u00a0plan to virtually nominate Biden ahead of the\u00a0Democratic convention\u00a0in Chicago\u00a0next month\u00a0\u2013 ignoring the growing calls from some of the party\u2019s elected officials to ditch that strategy given the serious ongoing debate about whether the president should continue to seek a second term.

{"id": "2024_07_16_us_trea-ellinger-sedated-death", "text": "When Trea Ellinger left a Baltimore drug rehab facility last summer, he assured his anxious mother that everything was fine. He had his medications and was planning to meet up with his girlfriend. By the following afternoon, he was dead \u2014 not from the violence his mom feared he might face, but because he didn\u2019t survive an encounter with first responders in downtown Baltimore. Ellinger, 29, died after being sedated and restrained. Despite repeated comments from police and medics at the scene acknowledging the dangers of lying face down in the prone position, responders failed to act urgently when the handcuffed Ellinger turned onto his stomach and remained that way for several minutes, according to investigators and experts. His death adds to a list of similar cases. A\u00a0recent investigation\u00a0led by The Associated Press found that the practice of giving\u00a0sedatives to people detained by police\u00a0has spread quietly across the nation over the last 15 years. The strategy, which was intended to reduce violence and save lives, has resulted in some avoidable deaths. In Ellinger\u2019s case, the autopsy determined that he died from overdosing on an antidepressant and methadone, which is commonly prescribed to curb opioid cravings. The findings didn\u2019t say if other factors might have contributed to his death. His mother, Lori Ellinger, questions the autopsy\u2019s findings and wants to know why paramedics decided to use an injectable sedative. \u201cI do believe they killed my son with that shot,\u201d she said. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be dead at 29 years old.\u201d Independent experts say Trea Ellinger could have died from the combined effects of being sedated and lying prone, which can obstruct a person\u2019s airways. The Baltimore City Fire Department, which employs the city\u2019s medics, provided copies of its policies regarding the use of sedatives, physical restraints and other related topics. But the agency declined to comment on the circumstances surrounding Ellinger\u2019s death, citing the potential for future litigation. None of the first responders involved have been charged, and Ellinger\u2019s family hasn\u2019t sued. According to an investigative report released in May by the Maryland attorney general\u2019s office, a 911 caller reported that a man was lying in the middle of a downtown Baltimore street, speaking incomprehensibly, and acting combative and distressed. Police body camera footage of the encounter shows officers handcuffing Ellinger at the request of medics. Officers laid him on his side until he was injected with midazolam and then lifted him onto a stretcher. \u201cAs long as he\u2019s not lying face down, that would be great,\u201d one of the medics says. Ellinger was initially positioned on his side again, but his continued flailing shifted him onto his stomach while first responders affixed the stretcher straps, according to the report. Inside the ambulance, one medic started checking his vital signs while another sat by his head. He remained face down, sometimes struggling against the stretcher\u2019s straps, the report says. Four minutes later, the medics discussed getting Ellinger repositioned, but they didn\u2019t act immediately. After another minute passed, Ellinger was \u201cmoving only slightly,\u201d the report says. Finally, a medic released the straps and helped roll Ellinger onto his side, noting that his lips were blue. The same medic told his colleague he could administer Narcan, an opioid overdose reversal medication. Ellinger was unhandcuffed and placed on his back as medics began performing chest compressions, according to the report. He regained a pulse and was transported to the hospital, where he later died. The report was produced under a\u00a0relatively new state law\u00a0that requires the Maryland attorney general\u2019s office to investigate all in-custody deaths. In this case, investigators specifically noted that they were only tasked with investigating the actions of the police officers, not those of the medics or other first responders. Eric Jaeger, an emergency medical services educator in New Hampshire who has no connection to the case, said the most obvious problem was that the medics left Ellinger prone for several minutes, potentially hindering his ability to breathe. He said he shows the bodycam footage to his students as an example of what can go wrong when a patient\u2019s airways aren\u2019t prioritized during sedation. \u201cI think Trea Ellinger would be alive today if he had been placed on the stretcher face up,\u201d Jaeger told the AP. He also questioned the initial decision to sedate Ellinger, saying medics should be particularly discerning about when to administer such drugs because of the risks they pose. When dealing with an agitated patient, fire department policy directs medics to \u201cplace the patient in supine position (face up) as soon as practical.\u201d A different policy says a restrained patient should be placed \u201cface up or on their side, if at all possible.\u201d Fire officials declined to answer questions about the case, including whether the agency is conducting an internal review. The union representing firefighters and paramedics also declined to comment, and the mayor\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to recent inquiries about the case. It appears the decision to sedate Ellinger using midazolam was in accordance with department policy. Gail Van Norman, professor emeritus of anesthesiology at the University of Washington, said the sedative could have depressed his respiration and relaxed the muscles of his upper airway, making him more vulnerable to cardiac arrest. \u201cThe medics made a few medical mistakes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this was a rapidly evolving situation where the unexpected happened. I don\u2019t envy them the decisions they had to make.\u201d Ellinger died last July. In April, Baltimore prosecutors announced their decision not to bring charges. The investigative report was released the following month. Meanwhile, Lori Ellinger is still trying to process the untimely death of her only child. She wears a necklace shaped like a guitar that symbolizes Trea\u2019s passion for music. She scrolls through old photos on her phone and reminisces about his childhood. Trea Ellinger grew up in rural northeastern Maryland and worked for a concrete company after finishing high school. Despite his struggles with substance abuse, he spent much of his 20s crisscrossing the country with a traveling carnival, a job he loved. In the months before his death, he was trying to stay on track and taking methadone to curb his opioid cravings. His mom said he had been previously diagnosed with mental health issues, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Lori Ellinger visited her son at his rehab facility and brought him some groceries the day before his death. She said he seemed in good spirits. But a couple hours later, he called and said another resident had stabbed him in the shoulder during an argument. His injuries weren\u2019t severe, but the facility asked him to leave, she said. She believes he ended up sleeping on the streets that night. The following afternoon, he was seen stumbling around downtown Baltimore, falling repeatedly and acting disoriented, according to the investigative report. Watching the videos and reading the report, Lori Ellinger\u2019s heart breaks for her son. Clearly he was experiencing some sort of crisis, but she didn\u2019t get a call until hours later, when a nurse told her he had already died. \u201cI love and miss him,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had a lot of good years \u2014 but not enough.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/us/trea-ellinger-sedated-death/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
