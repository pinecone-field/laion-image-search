On Monday, the body of a fallen climber was discovered on Alaska\u2019s Denali \u2013 the tallest peak in North America, according to Denali National Park and Preserve rangers. The climber was found by a mountaineering patrol after a concerned family member contacted rangers Sunday to say they had not heard from the climber for several days, according to an NPS news release. The climber, who was attempting a solo climb of Denali, had been regularly checking-in with family through a satellite communication device. \u201cMountaineering rangers patrolling the upper mountain quickly located the climber\u2019s empty tent at the top of the 16,200-foot ridge,\u201d the news release reads. After conducting interviews with other climbers and gathering location data from the climber\u2019s satellite device, rangers determined that the climber had last been seen on Wednesday, May 15, while traversing the 17,200-foot plateau to Denali Pass at 18,200 feet. \u201cData indicated the device had not changed location since Thursday, May 16, suggesting a fall from the Denali Pass traverse took place on that day,\u201d NPS said. The climber was found on Denali\u2019s West Buttress route and was confirmed deceased. \u201cRanger patrol then secured the climber in place and returned to high camp,\u201d the release said. \u201cRecovery efforts will be attempted when weather conditions allow.\u201d The park service has not released the identity of the fallen climber. \u201cSince 1980, at least fourteen climbers have died in falls along this treacherous section of the West Buttress route, including the soloist,\u201d the park service said. Also this week, a hiker in Oregon died after officials say she went off-trail while hiking the Oneonta Trail in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, west of Portland. Elisha Angelic Macias, 22, was hiking\u00a0with friends on Sunday when she left the group and went off trail, according to a news release\u00a0from the Multnomah County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \u201cNo one in the group saw her fall,\u201d the release reads. \u201cIt is estimated that she fell 50-60 feet.\u201d When deputies arrived, another hiker was performing CPR, the sheriff\u2019s office said, but emergency responders pronounced her dead on the scene. The deaths add to a number of deadly falls reported at US National parks and hiking areas in recent months. Last month, a\u00a052-year-old woman died and another was seriously injured after falling 1,000 feet while ascending Mt. Johnson in Denali National Park, CNN previously\u00a0reported. Additionally, the body of a 23-year-old hiker who went missing during storms earlier this month was found\u00a0at Rocky Mountain National Park last week after initial investigations show that he took a significant fall.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/us/deaths-falls-hiking-climbing-parks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "us"}}

Despite the impressive achievements, Tillman remembers turning to her mother and saying, \u201cI think I want to pursue a doctorate degree.\u201d Her mother,\u00a0Jimalita\u00a0Tillman, was surprised. They were in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. And Dorothy was a year into launching a science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) camp startup, and she was looking for funding for the organization. She was busy. \u201cI was just like, \u2018why?\u2019 I thought you were done,\u201d Jimalita told CNN. But after Dorothy explained that her mission was to positively impact young people when it came to their mental health, Jimalita understood and lent her support. Fast-forward two years, when 17-year-old Dorothy\u00a0successfully delivered her dissertation. Now, at 18, she is officially Dr. Dorothy Jean Tillman after walking at Arizona State University\u2019s College of Health Solutions convocation on May 8. Jimalita\u00a0told CNN that seeing her daughter achieve so much is humbling. \u201cI knew what it took for her to go through that. She had to sacrifice a lot. A lot of her fears and going through different things during the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cShe emerged as a leader without fear, showing them how to navigate online schooling.\u201d From a young age, Dorothy excelled in her academic pursuits. By age 7, she was already doing high school work. At that point, she started to take college level module tests and apply the credits toward higher education. \u201cIt was always a very hard thing to kind of stomach mentally being so young. When you get out of college, you\u2019re thinking, \u2018what do I do next?\u2019 Now I am able to sit in the comfortability of being a teenager and being OK with the fact that I don\u2019t have to figure out what comes next,\u201d Dorothy said. She studied integrated behavioral health at Arizona State University. For her dissertation, she explored the stigma that prevents university students from getting mental health treatment. In addition to her school work, Dorothy also devotes her time to running the\u00a0Dorothy Jeanius\u00a0STEAM Leadership Institute, which inspires hundreds of underserved young people in Chicago, as well as abroad in countries like Ghana and South Africa, to pursue STEAM careers. The program includes guest speakers and open conversations around each of the five areas of STEAM. \u201cWe just want to provide them with all the resources possible and the best foundation to be able to start walking on that pathway to their dreams,\u201d she said. While so many people marvel at the success she\u2019s achieved, Tillman says she is still a normal teen who spends time with family and friends. She gives credit to her mother as one of her greatest motivators. \u201cI definitely couldn\u2019t have gotten this far without her, like she\u2019s definitely the best teammate, the best supporter,\u201d she said. Another inspiration for Tillman is her grandmother, former Chicago alderwoman Dorothy Tillman, who worked alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during the civil rights movement. After graduating from ASU, Tillman hopes to continue developing her camps and start applying her studies on integrated behavioral health into her work. There is a potential for franchising the camps one day so more kids gain something, she says.\u00a0She also hopes to work more with kids in Africa. \u201cI\u2019ve been focusing on my studies a lot and I don\u2019t go nearly as much as I should,\u201d Tillman said. \u201cNow I\u2019m glad to have the time for things like that.\u201d While she\u00a0has achieved a lot at her age, Tillman tells people it\u2019s all about having\u00a0a supportive family around her. \u201cIt\u2019s teamwork that makes the dream work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a village that builds the land. It\u2019s having those people there with you that is going to, you know, uphold you at the end of the day.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/us/dorothy-tillman-chicago-arizona-state/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "us"}}

But last week, her message to her\u00a0more than\u00a06.5 million combined followers on Instagram and TikTok was anything but. Instead of her usual smiling, clapping and cheering, the popular social media creator, whose full name is Rachel Griffin Accurso, was in tears. \u201cThe bullying is so bad. It\u2019s so bad. But I can handle this,\u201d she said in\u00a0a video\u00a0posted to her accounts last\u00a0Thursday. It showed a closeup of an emotional Accurso in a dark room, wiping her eyes. \u201cThat is who I am. I love my neighbor. I love every child,\u201d she added. \u201cImagining for one second what a mom is going through unable to feed her child or give her child clean water or keep her child safe.\u201d The backlash had started\u00a0four\u00a0days earlier, after Accurso announced a campaign to raise money for children in several war-torn parts of the world, including Gaza.\u00a0She began receiving\u00a0angry comments on her posts, asking why she wasn\u2019t also trying to help victims of Hamas\u2019 deadly October 7 attack on Israel. \u201cYou should be for all children not just the children in gaza. Do you not care what hamas did to all the innocent jewish children october 7th???\u201d\u00a0one Instagram\u00a0comment said. \u201cYou mention the children of Gaza in your video \u2026 how about the children held hostage? Do you care about all children?\u201d another commenter posted on TikTok. In the caption on her tearful May 16 video, Accurso reiterated her concern for all the world\u2019s children. \u201cPalestinian children, Israeli children, children in the US \u2013 Muslim, Jewish, Christian children \u2013 all children, in every country,\u201d\u00a0she wrote. \u201cNot one is excluded.\u201d Her clarification was not enough to quell backlash from commenters who accused her of disregarding the pain of Israeli children. CNN has reached out to Accurso for comment. Between the polarizing Israel-Hamas war and fiery recent protests on US college campuses, some social media influencers have felt pressure to speak up. But the Ms Rachel episode is a reminder that even the most innocuous influencers can\u00a0face pushback\u00a0when they wade into a thorny issue like the Middle East. She raised $50,000 within hours for children affected by war Accurso is an educator who uses videos filled with songs and games to help toddlers and parents navigate the early childhood years. Her series, \u201cSongs for Littles,\u201d features catchy, educational tunes that are popular with both parents and young children. Her videos are a hit with 9.8 million subscribers\u00a0on YouTube, and span a myriad of topics, including learning how to talk and read. She announced her fundraising campaign\u00a0in a video\u00a0posted May 12 to her TikTok and Instagram accounts, offering to make Cameos \u2014 paid personalized video messages that a celebrity can film on request. Accurso said her earnings from the videos will go to Save the Children\u2019s emergency fund for kids affected by war and mentioned Gaza along with Sudan, Ukraine, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \u201cHopefully I can make little ones smile by giving them a personal video and then the money will go to help more children living in unimaginable circumstances,\u201d she said in the video. \u201cChildren should never experience the horrors of war. These are grave violations of their human rights. Children should be protected.\u201d A day later, she posted another message on the horrifying effects of war. \u201cWe should be ashamed of how children around the world are suffering,\u201d she wrote. Cameo requests and money flooded in. Within hours, she\u2019d raised\u00a0$50,000 from 500 requests\u00a0for personal videos, she said. \u201cEvery penny on my end will go to [Save the Children] to help children facing unimaginable circumstances,\u201d she wrote.\u00a0CNN has reached out to Save the Children for comment. Accurso then paused the\u00a0Cameo requests,\u00a0saying she needed time to film the 500 personalized videos before she could accept\u00a0any\u00a0more. Then came the backlash. A few days later, she posted the tearful video, with the comments turned off\u00a0on Instagram. Instead of her trademark pink T-shirt and denim dungarees, she was barely visible in dim lighting and clutching what appeared to be a blanket. She did not go into details about the bullying she said she\u2019s received and has disabled comments on YouTube and\u00a0some\u00a0Instagram posts. She also received supportive messages. \u201cThis is a moral litmus test and you\u2019re on the right side,\u201d one commenter posted on her TikTok. \u201cStay strong.\u201d Another added: \u201cYou are the Mr. Rogers to our babies\u2019 generation. Thank you for using your platform in such an influential way.\u201d Divisive issues can be tricky for social media influencers, expert says Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel on October 7 and took some 250 hostages into Gaza. In response, Israel launched a war on Hamas in Gaza that continues seven months later. More than 14,000 children have been killed in Gaza since the war started in October,\u00a0according to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. About 12,000 more children have been wounded and thousands remain missing, it says. \u201cRafah is a city of children,\u201d UNICEF\u00a0spokesperson James Elder said\u00a0this month, referring to the Palestinian city in southern Gaza. \u201cIf we define safety \u2014 as international humanitarian law says we must \u2014 as freedom from bombardment, as well as access to safe water, sufficient food, shelter and medicine \u2014 then there is nowhere safe on the Gaza Strip to go to.\u201d Accurso is one of a number of\u00a0social media influencers\u00a0who have used their platforms to raise funds as the humanitarian crisis unfolds in Gaza.\u00a0She describes herself as an ambassador for\u00a0Save the Children. Giselle Ugarte, an online performance and personal branding coach, says joining conversations on such a divisive issue can be tricky for a social media influencer like Accurso, whose brand is built around kids. \u201cMs Rachel is someone who is looked at as an educational resource for young children, a neutral force and a safe place, separated from any of the dangers of the outside world,\u201d she said. \u201cParents want to feel that they can step away from the screen and not have to worry about their children consuming content outside of her traditional programming.\u201d Ugarte said she advises influencers to assess whether wading into a polarizing issue aligns with their mission and brand, and to first \u201crecognize the potential backlash, consequences or perhaps even physical dangers.\u201d Accurso\u00a0has\u00a0said she plans to resume\u00a0her Cameo fundraising campaign.\u00a0And she\u2019s back to pleading for help for the children of Gaza. \u201cI saw a picture of two babies in Gaza and their thighs are like this small,\u201d she said in\u00a0a post Tuesday, choking back tears and making a circle with her thumb and forefinger. \u201cWe can\u2019t let children starve.

{"id": "2024_05_23_us_scottie-scheffler-arrest-update-louisville", "text": "Louisville police released two videos Thursday showing some of the arrest of star golfer Scottie Scheffler last week and announced the detective who arrested him was disciplined for not turning on his body-worn camera at the time. One video from a fixed pole camera positioned across the street shows portions of the interaction between Scheffler and police. In the video, a vehicle turns left and an officer wearing reflective gear runs toward the vehicle, which then stops. Police then take the driver out of the car and a group of three people walk across the street. A second video from a police vehicle\u2019s dashcam shows two officers walking with a handcuffed Scheffler. The videos were released a week after Scheffler was arrested, charged with felony assault, released from jail and then made his tee time in a whirlwind few hours at the PGA Championship, one of golf\u2019s four major tournaments. The world no. 1 golfer was attempting to drive to the Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville for the second round of the tournament at about 6 a.m. when he came to the scene of a fatal crash. He allegedly injured a police officer who was directing traffic and was arrested, according to police. Scheffler, 27, a new father with a sterling reputation, was charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer, along with lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, according to Jefferson County court records. After taking a mugshot and warming up in a jail cell, he was released and made it to his tee time at the golf club. He then shot 5-under that day on his way to finishing the tournament in a tie for 8th place. Scheffler described the incident as a \u201cbig misunderstanding\u201d during a \u201cchaotic situation.\u201d After the news conference Thursday, Scheffler\u2019s attorney, Steve Romines, reiterated the golfer still plans to plead not guilty to the charges. \u201cIt won\u2019t impact my case at all. Our position is the same as it was last Friday: Scottie Scheffler didn\u2019t do anything wrong. We\u2019re not interested in settling the case. We will either try it or it\u2019ll be dismissed. It\u2019s very simple,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the evidence that continues to come out just continues to support what Scottie said all along, this was a chaotic situation and a miscommunication and he didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d High-ranking police officials in Louisville have privately voiced concerns a felony charge against Scheffler is excessive, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN. Prosecutors said Thursday they continue to investigate the case. \u201cThe Jefferson County Attorney\u2019s office has continued to receive evidence and has yet to conduct final interviews with investigators regarding the charges filed by LMPD against Mr. Scheffler,\u201d said Josh Abner, a spokesman for the office. \u201cAs we have stated previously, no decisions have been made and our review continues.\u201d Scheffler, meanwhile, teed off for his first round at the Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth, Texas, on Thursday afternoon. Police discipline detective for not activating body-worn camera At a news conference Thursday, Louisville\u2019s mayor and police chief announced that an internal investigation of the case led to discipline for the arresting officer, Detective Bryan Gillis. \u201cDetective Gillis should have turned on his body-worn camera, but did not,\u201d Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. \u201cHis failure to do so is a violation of the LMPD policy on uniforms and equipment, subject category body-worn camera.\u201d The police chief said Gillis did not have his body-worn camera \u201coperationally ready\u201d as required. The detective has received \u201ccorrective action,\u201d the chief said, though the specifics of that discipline were not made clear. \u201cActivating body-worn cameras is critically important for our police department to have evidence, to maintain community trust, to be transparent,\u201d Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said. Further, police released several documents related to the detective\u2019s failure to activate his body-worn camera. In one, Gillis explained he \u201cnever powered up\u201d his body-worn camera and described his own version of what happened. \u201cWhile directing traffic in front of Gate 1 the PGA personnel stopped a bus from entering Gate 1,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI observed a vehicle traveling in the opposing lanes coming at me. I stopped the driver and advised him he could not proceed because of the bus. He demanded to be let in, and proceeded forward against my directions. I was dragged/knocked down by the driver. I then proceeded to arrest the driver.\u201d Neither the mayor nor the police chief took questions from the media at Thursday\u2019s news conference. What we know about the arrest According to a Louisville Metro Police report, Scheffler was trying to drive into the golf course when he was stopped by an officer wearing a full police uniform and a yellow reflective rain jacket. The officer, identified as Gillis, stopped Scheffler and \u201cattempted to give instructions,\u201d the report states. \u201cSubject refused to comply and accelerated forward, dragging Detective Gillis to the ground,\u201d according to the report. The detective suffered pain, swelling and abrasions to his left wrist and knee and was taken to the hospital for further treatment, the report states. His uniform pants, valued at about $80, \u201cwere damaged beyond repair,\u201d the report adds. Romines, Scheffler\u2019s attorney, said the golfer was headed to the course early to prepare to play. \u201cDue to the combination of event traffic and a traffic fatality in the area it was a very chaotic situation. He was proceeding as directed by another traffic officer and driving a marked player\u2019s vehicle with credentials visible,\u201d Romines said in a statement. \u201cIn the confusion, Scottie is alleged to have disregarded a different officer\u2019s traffic signals resulting in these charges.\u201d Multiple eyewitnesses have said Scheffler \u201cdid not do anything wrong\u201d but drove as directed, according to Romines. \u201cHe stopped immediately upon being directed to and never at any point assaulted any officer with his vehicle,\u201d the statement reads. ESPN\u2019s Jeff Darlington witnessed the encounter and filmed part of it. When Scheffler arrived in a marked player courtesy vehicle, he tried to drive around the crash scene on a median, according to ESPN. Darlington wrote on social media that Scheffler \u201ccontinued to drive about 10 to 20 yards toward the entrance\u201d before stopping. \u201cThe police officer attempted to attach himself to Scheffler\u2019s car, and Scheffler then stopped his vehicle at the entrance to Valhalla,\u201d Darlington\u00a0wrote on X. \u201cThe police officer then began to scream at Scheffler to get out of the car. When Scheffler exited the vehicle, the officer shoved Scheffler against the car and immediately placed him in handcuffs.\u201d Police escorted a handcuffed Scheffler into a police vehicle, Darlington\u2019s video shows. \u201cRight now he\u2019s going to jail,\u201d an officer at the scene says in the video. Scheffler\u2019s arraignment was originally scheduled for Tuesday but was delayed to June due to his attorney\u2019s scheduling issue.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/us/scottie-scheffler-arrest-update-louisville/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_investing_dow-falls-waiting-fed-rate-cut", "text": "The Dow tumbled by more than 600 points Thursday, notching its worst day of 2024, as all three major indexes closed lower. The drop came even after AI-darling Nvidia delivered stellar quarterly earnings and announced a 10-for-1 stock split. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) soared more than 9%\u00a0as the wider market dropped lower, highlighting a lack of market breadth. (Nvidia is not one of the 30 stocks that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average.) Boeing (BA) weighed on markets on Thursday, dropping more than 7.5% after the beleaguered aircraft manufacturer said its cash flows were worse than expected this year. That caused concern amongst investors that its debt ratings could be classified as junk bonds. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, which began the day at new intraday highs, fell by 0.7% and 0.4%, respectively. The Dow, meanwhile, closed lower by 606 points, or 1.5%. Strong data The selloff came after the Purchasing Managers Index for May, expected to fall slightly, came in 3.5 percentage points higher, the highest level since last June. That\u2019s an indication that the economy is not being held back by inflation, even though price hikes have started to ease once more. \u201cTech is the only industry sector not in the red,\u201d wrote Louis Navellier of Navellier Investing in a note to clients on Thursday. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have NVIDIA in your index it\u2019s not a good day.\u201d Labor data also came in stronger than expected on Thursday morning: Weekly initial jobless claims totaled 215,000, slightly below the analyst consensus of 220,000, according to FactSet data. April new home sales missed estimates on Thursday, coming in at an annualized rate of 634,000 versus 678,000 expected. Fewer homes being built indicates that there\u2019s less economic confidence on the part of builders and that they\u2019re having more difficulty borrowing the money to build them. Fed fears The Federal Reserve spooked markets on Wednesday afternoon when they released the notes from their last policy meeting. The minutes showed that \u201cvarious\u201d officials said they would be willing to raise interest rates if necessary and that there were doubts as to whether financial conditions are restrictive enough to keep inflation from resurging.

Park officials said they received a report on Sunday about \u201ca 35-year-old male visitor from Massachusetts who was seriously injured by a bear in the area of the Signal Mountain Summit Road,\u201d the National Park Service said in a news release Monday. Following an investigation, park officials have determined \u201cthe incident was a surprise encounter with two grizzly bears.\u201d The earlier bear attack occurred in the Canadian Rockies. The man, who was airlifted by helicopter to a nearby ambulance, is in stable condition, according to the park service, and expected to make a full recovery. With news of the attack still fresh, the park has closed both Signal Mountain Summit Road and Signal Mountain Trail to the general public. On Thursday, a grizzly bear was found dead in Elkford, British Columbia, after inflicting \u201csignificant injuries\u201d on a 36-year-old man who used a firearm to defend himself. \u201cOfficers are confident that they located the bear involved in the attack. The bear succumbed to its wounds,\u201d the British Columbia Conservation Officer Services said. CNN was able to confirm Sunday the man was also airlifted to a hospital but no update on his condition was given. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police initially reported he sustained broken bones and lacerations. Adult grizzly bears begin to come out of hibernation in springtime as the winter snowpack dissipates, the park service said in an informational release in April. \u201cThey search for available foods and often scavenge animals that died during the winter.\u201d Since the first grizzly bear sighting in Grand Teton on March 26, what is called \u201cbear season\u201d has begun. \u201cAll of Teton County is now in occupied grizzly bear habitat,\u201d the park service said. Visitors are encouraged to carry bear spray, make noise, be alert, and secure any food, garbage or toiletries. They are also instructed to \u201cnot run\u201d upon seeing a bear.  Noting that \u201cbear behavior is complex,\u201d the park service says, \u201cLike people, bears react differently to each situation.

{"id": "2024_05_23_us_marilyn-mosby-baltimore-sentencing", "text": "A federal judge has sentenced Baltimore\u2019s former top prosecutor Marilyn Mosby to time served and 12 months of home confinement \u2013 to be served concurrently with 3 years of supervised release \u2013 for mortgage fraud and perjury. In addition, Mosby was ordered to complete 100 hours of community service, according to the judgment. Mosby, who gained national prominence for charging six police officers in connection with the 2015 death of Freddie Gray in a police van, was convicted in two trials of making a false mortgage application and perjury. US prosecutors had asked the court to sentence Mosby, 44, to 20 months in prison, followed by a supervised release, according to a May 9 sentencing memorandum. That sentence, the memo says, would \u201cmake clear that those who break the law, including those in positions of public trust, will be held accountable.\u201d Mosby has claimed she is innocent and the charges against her are politically motivated. Her attorneys\u00a0argued in a May 16 response she \u201chas been punished enough,\u201d asking for a sentence of time served with one year of supervised release. US District Court Judge Lydia Griggsby said she took into account that two juries found Mosby did something wrong and \u201cbreached a public trust,\u201d according to CNN affiliate WBAL-TV, which had a reporter in court. The judge also said the fact that Mosby is a mother of two weighed heavily on the court, according to the news station. In addition to Thursday\u2019s sentence, Griggsby ordered Mosby to forfeit 90% of her interests in the Longboat Key, Florida, condo connected to her conviction on making a false mortgage application. A preliminary order filed Thursday authorized the government to seize the property. Once sold, Mosby could receive up to $47,600 plus 10% of the home\u2019s appreciation value. Mosby walked out of court with her two daughters and alongside a group of supporters, including civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who chanted, \u201cJustice for Marilyn.\u201d Mosby told the crowd she was \u201ceternally grateful\u201d for all her supporters and advocates. \u201cThis is not over,\u201d she said. \u201cBut God was here today and I know he\u2019s with me, he touched the heart of this judge and has allowed me to go home to my babies.\u201d In a statement sent to CNN after the sentencing, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Maryland said, \u201cAs always, we respect the judgment of the court.\u201d Where the convictions stem from Mosby\u2019s trials, convictions and sentence mark\u00a0a remarkable undoing for a prosecutor who took office just months before\u00a0Gray died\u00a0from spinal injuries suffered while in police custody in the back of a van. Three officers were acquitted, leading Mosby to\u00a0drop the charges\u00a0against the rest. Her\u00a0sentencing follows Mosby\u2019s conviction on three charges across two trials. Mosby was first found guilty in November of two counts of perjury after prosecutors accused her of falsely claiming in 2020 she experienced \u201cadverse financial consequences\u201d as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic to withdraw $90,000 in retirement funds. At the time, she earned a gross salary of $247,955.58, the indictment said, and her pay was never reduced. Mosby then was found guilty in February of making a false mortgage application stemming from the purchase of a Florida condo, the Justice Department said. At trial, prosecutors presented evidence showing Mosby falsely stated she had gotten a $5,000 gift from her husband to be applied to the purchase of the property to get a lower interest rate. In fact, the Justice Department said, Mosby sent her husband $5,000, which he then transferred back to her. The jury in that trial acquitted Mosby of a second charge of making a false mortgage application stemming from the purchase of another Florida home.

{"id": "2024_05_21_us_oklahoma-women-killings-buried-freezer", "text": "Two women who disappeared during a drive between Kansas and Oklahoma amid a contentious custody battle were found dead inside a freezer buried in a cattle pasture leased by one of the five suspects in their killings, according to newly released search warrants. Affidavits in the case say the remains of Veronica Butler, 27, and Jilian Kelley, 39, were discovered while authorities were investigating a fresh pile of dirt on property leased by Tad Cullum,\u00a0one of the five people charged with two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of kidnapping and one count of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. \u201cOn April 14, 2024, a chest freezer was excavated and opened. Within the chest freezer, the bodies of Butler and Kelley were located,\u201d the search warrant states. The court documents do not reveal how Butler and Kelley were killed. Along with Cullum, police have charged Tifany Adams, the 54-year-old grandmother of Butler\u2019s children who shared custody with Butler; married couple Cole Twombly, 50, and Cora Twombly, 44; and Paul Grice, 31. Court documents allege Adams and her significant other, Cullum, engaged in a killing plot with the Twomblys motivated by a custody battle between Butler and Adams, who is the grandmother of Butler\u2019s two children. Special Agent Jason Ott with the\u00a0Oklahoma\u00a0State Bureau of Investigation testified all the suspects knew each other through \u201can anti-government group that had a religious affiliation.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The five suspects have not yet entered pleas in the case. CNN has reached out to the suspects\u2019 attorneys for comment. Women went missing on drive to visit children The two women were driving from Hugoton, Kansas, to Four Corners, Oklahoma, for Butler\u2019s supervised visit with her children when they went missing on March 30, according to the affidavit. Their vehicle was found abandoned near a highway in Texas County, where investigators found a bloody scene scattered with \u201cevidence of a severe injury,\u201d probable cause documents state. Investigators determined Adams purchased three burner phones, all of which had pinged near where Butler\u2019s car was found and at the last known location of the women before their disappearance, according to the affidavit. Cell phone data from two of the burner phones led authorities to a pasture property rented by Cullum, where a hole had been dug and filled back in, the affidavit states. The disturbed dirt was excavated and two bodies, later identified as Butler and Kelley, were discovered, the affidavit said. The site was about 8.5 miles from where the abandoned car was found, it noted. \u201cThe state of the bodies indicated they died as a result of foul play,\u201d the affidavits stated. No further details about the condition of the bodies were provided. A stun gun was also found near the site, according to the affidavit. In their arguments to deny the suspects bail, prosecutors said the killings were \u201ccomplex and involved extensive preparation,\u201d according to the court motion. Prosecutors also noted that some of the suspects had \u201cresources to flee if given the opportunity\u201d and \u201cpose grave danger to witnesses (and) community members.\u201d More than two weeks after Butler and Kelley disappeared, a search warrant says, Grice told an acquaintance he wanted to know \u201chow long DNA would last in dirt\u201d and on clothing, a search warrant says.\u00a0An arrest affidavit released earlier\u00a0said\u00a0Grice admitted to taking part in the killing and burial of the victims. The court documents do not reveal how Butler and Kelley were killed. The defendants are scheduled to be back in court in June for a status hearing. They were ordered held in jail without bond.

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_donald-trump-bronx-rally", "text": "Former President Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a rally Thursday in the Bronx as his campaign looks to make inroads with Hispanic and Black voters ahead of November\u2019s election. The event in one of the most Democratic counties in the country comes days ahead of closing arguments in Trump\u2019s New York criminal hush money trial. Trump faces 34 felony counts and has pleaded not guilty. The trial has tethered the former president to New York for much of the past six weeks, but Thursday\u2019s event in Crotona Park in the South Bronx will be Trump\u2019s first major campaign rally in the state since his initial presidential run in 2016. Trump has visited a bodega, which was the scene of a fatal stabbing in 2022, a construction site and a fire station in Manhattan since his trial began in mid-April. A Trump campaign official told CNN that several factors, including the former president\u2019s long history of living and working in New York and his efforts to win over minority voters, played into the decision to hold the Bronx rally. The official said that the area\u2019s proximity to Trump\u2019s criminal trial was also a consideration, as was the former president\u2019s desire to \u201cchallenge the status quo\u201d in a state that has long voted for Democrats. Trump has insisted that he has a shot this fall at winning New York, which a Republican presidential nominee has not carried since 1984. The Bronx is a Democratic stronghold, which Trump lost by about 68 points to Joe Biden in 2020. That margin, however, was down from four years earlier, when Hillary Clinton carried the county by 79 points. Trump\u2019s improvement was even greater in the South Bronx, where Thursday\u2019s rally is taking place. Biden won the election district (or precinct) surrounding Crotona Park by 69 points. Clinton carried the same precinct by more than 90 points in 2016. Trump\u2019s performance in the Bronx in 2020 mirrored his results in other areas where Hispanic voters make up a substantial portion of the electorate. Residents in the South Bronx are mainly Hispanic (64%) and Black (31%), according to the US Census Bureau. Polling this year shows Trump may do even better among Hispanic and Black voters than he did four years ago. Surveys taken since the beginning of April show Biden\u2019s margin among these voters down double digits compared with surveys from the same point in 2020. This is likely part of the reason why the Biden campaign launched two new ads Thursday aimed at highlighting what it called \u201cTrump\u2019s long record of failures and broken promises\u201d to Black Americans. The spots point out that Trump was sued for housing discrimination in the 1970s and charged with discriminating against African Americans; promoted the racist conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the US;\u00a0pushed for the death penalty for five minority teenagers who were wrongly accused and convicted of beating and raping a woman in Central Park in the 1980s; and \u201cstood with violent White supremacists\u201d in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. The Trump campaign said the ads represented an attempt to \u201cgaslight Black voters.\u201d \u201cWe must not forget that it was Joe Biden who was a key figure in passing the 1994 Crime Bill, which disproportionately harmed Black communities through harsh sentencing laws and increased incarceration rates. Additionally, we cannot overlook that Biden\u2019s policies are driving Black families deeper into poverty and making them less safe,\u201d Janiyah Thomas, the campaign\u2019s Black media director, said in a statement. Several House Republicans from New York said they could no longer make it to Trump\u2019s event due to changes in the chamber\u2019s voting schedule Thursday. \u201cNew York is in play and we had all planned to be there to greet him and attend this historic event. However, the House schedule changed and we will be voting to ban illegal immigrants from voting in elections and to protect American\u2019s right to financial privacy,\u201d House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, seen as a potential Trump running mate,\u00a0said in a joint statement with seven other lawmakers. Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ritchie Torres, who represent parts of the Bronx, blasted the former president\u2019s upcoming event. Ocasio-Cortez, in an interview with NY1, called it an \u201cattempt to, I think, trick some of our folks here,\u201d while Torres told The New York Times that Trump was \u201cradioactive\u201d in the Bronx. Trump\u2019s outreach to minority voters also comes as the former president has made stoking fears about undocumented migrants a cornerstone of his campaign. He has regularly made false or misleading claims about illegal immigration and\u00a0used dehumanizing language when referring to migrants.

{"id": "2024_05_23_tech_live-nation-antitrust-violations-doj-lawsuit", "text": "In a groundbreaking antitrust lawsuit that threatens to upend the way concertgoers pay for tickets, the US government and dozens of states sued Live Nation on Thursday, alleging that for years the parent company of Ticketmaster abused its industry dominance to harm fans nationwide. The long-expected suit, filed in New York by the Justice Department and 30 state and district attorneys general, challenges the country\u2019s biggest ticketing website and concert promoter, which regulators allege was the mastermind of a plan to stifle competition. The governments are seeking a jury trial and a breakup of the company. If successful, the case could lead to sweeping changes in the market for live events \u2013 an industry that came under intense scrutiny in 2022 after glitches at Ticketmaster blocked millions from purchasing tickets for Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cEras\u201d tour. For many critics of Live Nation, the Swift debacle revealed how a lack of competition has led to harms ranging from poor customer service to confusing pricing to expensive ticketing fees to restrictions on ticket resales \u2014 amounting to what many consumers complain of as death by a thousand cuts. But fans hoping to save money aren\u2019t yet out of the woods, as the suit will likely take years to make its way through the court system. Meanwhile, the exorbitant fees they know all too well aren\u2019t likely to be dramatically affected. In a statement, Live Nation called the DOJ\u2019s allegations \u201cbaseless.\u201d \u201cThe DOJ\u2019s lawsuit won\u2019t solve the issues fans care about relating to ticket prices, service fees, and access to in-demand shows,\u201d Live Nation said in a statement. \u201cCalling Ticketmaster a monopoly may be a PR win for the DOJ in the short term, but it will lose in court because it ignores the basic economics of live entertainment.\u201d Unlike some of the other businesses DOJ has sued, Live Nation does not reap enormous profits from its market position, the company added. \u201cLive Nation\u2019s net profit margin last fiscal year was 1.4% - nowhere near other DOJ targets in the tech sector,\u201d the company said in a statement, noting Apple and Google \u2013 both subjects of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust lawsuits, have margins north of 24%. Shares of Live Nation (LYV) fell 5% on the news. Not just frustrating \u2026 it\u2019s illegal, DOJ says Attorney General Merrick Garland in a press conference Thursday rattled off a seemingly endless list of fees Ticketmaster charges customers. \u201cThose include: ticketing fees, service fees, convenience fees, platinum fees, per-order fees, handling fees and payment processing fees, among others.\u201d But Garland noted the annoyance isn\u2019t why the Justice Department sued. \u201cWe\u2019re here not because Ticketmaster\u2019s conduct is inconvenient or frustrating \u2026 we\u2019re here because it\u2019s illegal,\u201d Garland said. Prosecutors allege that Live Nation\u2019s end game was to monopolize the ticketing and live events industry by cutting exclusive deals with the country\u2019s largest venues, ensuring that all their future events were ticketed through the company\u2019s platform. According to the lawsuit,\u00a0Live Nation directly manages more than 400 artists, controls around 60% of concert promotions at major concert venues across the country, and controls more than 265 concert venues in North America. And through Ticketmaster, the suit says, Live Nation controls roughly 80% or more of major concert venues\u2019 primary ticketing for concerts. \u201cWe allege that Live Nation relies on unlawful, anticompetitive conduct to exercise its monopolistic control over the live events industry in the United States at the cost of fans, artists, smaller promoters, and venue operators,\u201d said Garland in a statement. \u201cThe result is that fans pay more in fees, artists have fewer opportunities to play concerts, smaller promoters get squeezed out, and venues have fewer real choices for ticketing services. It is time to break up Live Nation-Ticketmaster.\u201d Bad blood Musicians, too, have complained of Live Nation\u2019s tightly integrated operation, which combines event ticketing services with control of roughly 200 popular US venues, a linkage that critics say allows the company to dictate terms and fees to artists. Reacting in 2022 to the Ticketmaster fiasco that enraged her fans, Swift wrote on Instagram that the situation was \u201cexcruciating for me\u201d and \u201cpisses me off.\u201d The company also has bad blood with several other artists who have taken aim at Live Nation\u2019s practices, including The Cure front man Robert Smith, who said he was \u201csickened\u201d by Ticketmaster\u2019s fees, and country singer Zach Bryan, who in 2022 released a collection of live performances entitled \u201cAll My Homies Hate Ticketmaster (Live at Red Rocks).\u201d Garland in his press conference talked about his personal experience going to a Bonnie Raitt concert in high school and seeing Bruce Springsteen as a warmup act. \u201cWe all knew we had just seen the future of rock and roll,\u201d he mused. \u201cThe Justice Department filed this lawsuit for fans who should be able to go to concerts without a monopoly standing in their way.\u201d Ticketmaster competitors were pleased by the lawsuit. \u201cFor nearly fifteen years, the Ticketmaster and Live Nation monopoly has ignored the fan experience: fans have been limited to a singular platform only to suffer through a consumer experience that fails them repeatedly,\u201d StubHub said in a statement. \u201cWe hope it creates a healthier ticketing market, one that empowers competition, drives innovation, and places the fan experience at the forefront.\u201d An unpopular merger Now, the US government is\u202fopposing Live Nation\u2019s economic power for the first time since the company merged with Ticketmaster in 2010. Regulators chose to tolerate it at the time; rather than sue to block the deal, they imposed certain obligations on the company meant to anticipate potential harms that the merger might cause. The lawsuit will likely be cheered by antitrust advocates who say they knew the Live Nation-Ticketmaster merger was trouble from the start. Among the deal\u2019s critics are US lawmakers including Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who as far back as 2019 were calling on the Justice Department to investigate Live Nation for not living up to its commitments. Klobuchar, Blumenthal and a number of other senators including Texas Republican Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz have proposed numerous bills to regulate the ticketing industry. \u201cThe Justice Department is doing the right thing today by seeking to break up this monopoly that has long harmed fans, artists, and venues,\u201d Klobuchar said in a statement. \u201cIn addition to holding Live Nation accountable, I\u2019ve also fought to create common sense guardrails to promote healthy competition in the ticketing market, and I will continue to work towards passing my bipartisan legislation that would do just that.\u201d The lawsuit highlights how regulators now believe, more than a decade on, that the behavioral modifications Live Nation agreed to have failed. Those claims dovetail with a wider push by the Biden administration ramping up antitrust enforcement across the entire economy, with officials blaming decades of lax enforcement for a wave of consolidation and a reduction in consumer power. The request for a jury trial is unusual: Recent antitrust lawsuits have asked for a judge to rule, because they can be long and get into complicated law. The list of states and districts participating in Thursday\u2019s suit includes Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming and the District of Columbia, according to the court docket in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. \u201cFor too long, Live Nation and Ticketmaster have unfairly and illegally run the world of live events, abusing their dominance to overcharge fans, bully venues, and limit artists,\u201d said\u00a0New York Attorney General Letitia James in a statement. \u201cEverybody agrees, Live Nation and Ticketmaster are the problem and it\u2019s time for a new era.\u201d This is a developing story. It will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/tech/live-nation-antitrust-violations-doj-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "us"}}

Democrats brought the measure back up after it failed earlier this year in an attempt to put pressure on Senate Republicans and shift the narrative on border security, but the bill exposed divides among Democrats as some came out against it, threatening to undermine the party\u2019s messaging effort. The vote was 43 to 50. As\u00a0immigration\u00a0remains top of mind for voters, the White House and top congressional Democrats have discussed a series of moves aimed at strengthening their hand on border security ahead of the first presidential debate next month.\u00a0Sources say those talks\u00a0included reviving the stalled border security measure\u00a0that\u00a0initially failed after former President Donald Trump told GOP lawmakers to knock it down. Democrats have pointed to the failure of the bill \u2013 which was negotiated on a bipartisan basis \u2013 to argue that Republicans are not serious about trying to fix problems at the southern border\u00a0and are ready to ramp up that argument after the bill stalled out a second time. But without Ukraine tied to the measure, some Democrats and immigrant advocates are casting it as purely political and taking issue with key elements of the bill \u2013 one of the toughest border measures in recent memory. Independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who was one of the lead negotiators on the bipartisan border bill, delivered a scathing speech ahead of the vote on the Senate floor where she criticized both sides of the aisle for \u201cpolitical theater.\u201d Sinema, who voted against the bill this time around, argued that border communities in Arizona are in dire need of real policy solutions and that playing politics with the issue erodes trust in Congress and forces \u201cboth parties further to the fringes.\u201d There were also new Democratic defections in this vote on the border bill. \u201cI will not vote for the bill coming to the Senate floor this week because it includes several provisions that will violate Americans\u2019 shared values. These provisions would not make us safe,\u201d\u00a0Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, said in a statement Tuesday. Booker voted to advance the bill in February when it failed 49-50. In his statement, Booker noted that the first time around the bill also included \u201ccritical foreign and humanitarian aid.\u201d Republicans have largely dismissed the vote as a political move for vulnerable Democrats to seek political cover over a major issue in the run-up to the November elections. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer acknowledged over the weekend that not every Democrat may vote for the bill in\u00a0a letter to colleagues.\u00a0Sixty votes are needed to break a GOP filibuster attempt.\u00a0Democrats only have 51 votes total and most Republicans have already said they plan to vote against the effort. The border bill was a topic of discussion Tuesday during Democrats\u2019 closed door party lunch as members debated the merits of bringing up a bill that has already failed to advance in the Senate. A source in the room told CNN that the vast majority were supportive, but that there were holdouts. Sen. Alex Padilla, who opposed the bill the first time around, said he will vote against the bill when it comes to the floor on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s also not lost on me that the last time we were here, a lot of people mentioned this was the price they were willing to pay for the sake of Ukraine funding. That is no longer the case,\u201d Padilla said, acknowledging that something needs to be done to address the border. \u201cThis should not be the Democratic starting point for border security.\u201d Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner said the fact there may be\u00a0internal\u00a0backlash incentivizes some moderates: \u201cFrankly, the fact that some of our most progressive members don\u2019t vote for it, in my mind, is an indication that it really was a true bipartisan, tough bill,\u201d he said. If passed, the bill would dramatically change immigration law for the first time in decades.\u00a0It includes, for example, a new emergency authority to restrict border crossings if daily average migrant encounters reach a certain level, raises the legal standard of proof to pass the initial screening for asylum and expedites the asylum processing timeline, among other measures. Most Republicans view the vote as largely a messaging exercise for Democrats. Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, told reporters on Thursday she plans to vote against advancing the border bill after voting for the previous effort. \u201cIf\u00a0it were a serious effort, we wouldn\u2019t be voting at two o\u2019clock on Thursday right as everyone\u2019s rushing out of town,\u201d she said. But Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who previously voted for the bill, indicated she\u00a0could\u00a0back the bill again, despite calling the process \u201cdumb.\u201d \u201cIf I thought it was good enough to vote for before, what changed?\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cExplain what is going on to someone who is not in this building. They think we\u2019re nuts.\u201d But Republican Sen. James Lankford, a key negotiator on the border bill, said he\u2019ll vote against the measure Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a bill. It\u2019s a prop,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins Tuesday. Democrats have sought to shift blame onto Republicans for not securing the border, citing their decision to walk away from a measure that restricted migrants\u2019 ability to seek asylum at the US southern border, among other restrictions. The message became a winning one in New York\u2019s third congressional district in February when\u00a0Democratic\u00a0Rep. Tom Suozzi went on offense on immigration and won the seat. The absence of foreign aid and inclusion of what some immigrant advocates describe as sharp policy has turned up the volume on criticism. \u201cIt is unconscionable and deeply disappointing for Senator Murphy to be championing these policies that will simply not work, and for Leader Schumer, the senator from the home to the Statue of Liberty, to be pushing for this vote,\u201d Robyn\u00a0Barnard,\u00a0senior director of refugee advocacy at Human Rights First, told CNN. \u201cThe American public were told these harsh policies were necessary to secure Ukraine funding earlier in the year, what is their excuse for adopting anti-immigrant policies now?\u201d Barnard said. The pressure on Congress also reflects the limited tools the administration has at its disposal to affect the situation on the ground over the next few months. \u201cWe recognize that there are limits to what any administration can do in this space with executive action,\u201d one senior administration official said. \u201cWhat we really need here and we continue to call for is for Congress to do its job and to take up and pass the Senate bipartisan border security legislation.\u201d Senior administration officials are bracing for the potential that border crossings will surge this summer, like in previous years and\u00a0are trotting out a series of policy changes to try to dissuade migrants from journeying to the US \u2013 and convince skeptical voters they are working to tighten up immigration at the border. \u201cAll of the factors that have been driving this unprecedented movement of people all over the world remain and we continue to be very vigilant and work, night and day to try to put policies in place that will mitigate its impact on our border,\u201d this senior official said. Discussions are ongoing on rolling out a border executive action, according to sources, who say that one of the considerations is doing so after Mexico\u2019s election in early June and potentially before the first presidential debate. It\u2019s all part of a broader strategy to remind voters they have a plan, Democrats say. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some pretty encouraging polling that indicates that once people know what we have the strongest, bipartisan border bill in generations and we are prepared to do real and tough things that moderates are willing to change their view about Democrats and border security,\u201d said Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii. \u201cIt\u2019s a good bill and it is something that needs attending to. That\u2019s our job. Let\u2019s bring it up,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Maine\u00a0Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. CNN\u2019s Sam Fossum contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_22_us_california-half-moon-bay-farms-settlements", "text": "Two mushroom farms in Northern California agreed to pay more than $450,000 in back wages and damages for dozens of employees stemming from a federal work- and living-conditions investigation that started after seven people were fatally shot there in 2023, the US Department of Labor said this week. The investigation into California Terra Gardens and Concord Farms Inc. in Half Moon Bay found the employers underpaid workers and provided unsafe housing conditions with mold and insect infestation, the Labor Department said in a news release Monday. The back wages and damages are part of administrative settlements the department reached with the two farms for multiple violations of the\u00a0Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act\u00a0and the\u00a0Fair Labor Standards Act, the department said. \u201cOur investigators found workers at California Terra Gardens and Concord Farms housed in sickening conditions, forced to sleep near garbage and with insects all around,\u201d Alberto Raymond, the department\u2019s wage and hour division assistant district director, said in the release. At California Terra Gardens, investigators uncovered that 39 workers were housed in cramped cargo containers, garages and dilapidated trailers, according to the department. They were forced to sleep on filthy mattresses and were exposed to insects and trash, according to the labor department. The farm\u2019s owners deducted money from workers\u2019 pay for the substandard housing illegally, the department determined. Two miles away, investigators found workers at Concord Farms were housed in moldy, makeshift rooms in a greenhouse infested with insects, the department said. That farm\u2019s owner shortchanged workers by not paying overtime past 40 hours worked in a week, and by not paying for work off the clock, the department said. The federal investigation started after a shooting in which authorities allege a California Terra Gardens worker, Chunil Zhao, killed seven workers and injured another at the two farms on January 23, 2023. Zhao, a Chinese citizen who was 66 at the time, was arrested that month and pleaded not guilty this year to seven counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder. He is awaiting trial. Zhao was a coworker or former coworker of the victims, and evidence indicated the attack was an instance of workplace violence in which specific people were targeted, the San Mateo County sheriff said at the time. After the shooting, officials including the state\u2019s governor criticized living conditions on the farms, and state and federal investigations into the conditions were launched. In June, the farms were cited by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health for \u201cserious\u201d health and safety violations. Following the federal Labor Department investigation, Concord Farms agreed to pay $370,107 in overtime wages and liquidated damages to 10 workers, $4,242 in late wages to 23 workers and $29,049 in civil money penalties, the release said. California Terra Gardens agreed to pay $84,074 to 39 workers for illegal housing deductions and $42,494 in civil money penalties, the department said. CNN has sought comment from California Terra Gardens and Concord Farms. \u201cThe Department of Labor is determined to hold employers accountable when they ignore their legal responsibilities to provide suitable housing when required and pay workers all their legally earned wages for the hard work they do in difficult conditions,\u201d Raymond said. \u201cWe are committed to enforcing these workplace protections that ensure a safe and suitable living conditions for seasonal workers.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/us/california-half-moon-bay-farms-settlements/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_us_moose-kills-alaska-man", "text": "A 70-year-old man was killed by a cow moose after he tried to take photos of the animal and its newborn calves near his home in southern Alaska on Sunday, authorities said. The man, Dale Chorman, was with a friend when the pair spotted a female moose and her two newborn calves in the city of Homer, the Alaska Department of Public Safety said. \u201cDale was with another adult male and they were attempting to take photos of two newborn moose calves when the cow moose attacked Dale,\u201d agency spokesperson Austin McDaniel told CNN in an email Tuesday. An\u00a0initial report\u00a0says the moose charged the two men and kicked one of them. The other man was not injured, McDaniel said. Chorman\u2019s body was sent to the Alaska State Medical Examiner\u2019s Office for an autopsy. CNN has sought more information from the medical examiner. Chorman\u2019s relatives are now remembering him as a loving father, husband and friend. However, they also are urging people to not blame the moose for his death. \u201cThe moose, obviously, is not at fault. To the concerned neighbors, I say \u2014 quell your primate spear rattling. The ungulate mother need not die. She was just protecting her offspring,\u201d Dale\u2019s son, Nathan Chorman, wrote in a statement, according to CNN affiliate KTUU. Dale was experienced around wildlife, according to his family. He\u2019d said the previous day that the brush was thick enough to come across a wild animal by accident, Nathan wrote. \u201cI\u2019m sure Dale was surprised too. On a given day, nobody expects to die on their own property doing something routine, even when the routine is fairly dangerous. But he would have accepted this outcome,\u201d Nathan\u2019s statement reads. \u201cThis was not a hapless fool stumbling into danger \u2014 this was a person who went out looking for a great photo, knowing the risks, and got caught in a dangerous moment,\u201d the son wrote. A small adult female moose can weigh up to 800 pounds and be up to 6 feet tall, according to the\u00a0Alaska Department of Fish and Game. While in the company of her calves, a female moose will not hesitate to attack should a person come near them, McDaniel said. \u201cCow moose with calves are known to be relentless in their efforts to defend their calves from perceived threats,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cThe Alaska wildlife troopers encourage Alaskans to not approach moose calves to take photos or attempt to pet them as there is likely a cow moose nearby.\u201d Homer is about 220 miles south of Anchorage on Alaska\u2019s Kenai Peninsula.

{"id": "2024_05_23_us_norfolk-southern-settlement-ohio-train-derailment", "text": "The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Justice have reached a $310 million settlement agreement with Norfolk Southern after last year\u2019s train derailment that spilled more than a million pounds of hazardous chemicals into the soil, water and air in Ohio. \u201cIf the settlement is approved by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Norfolk Southern will be required to take measures to improve rail safety, pay for health monitoring and mental health services for the surrounding communities, fund long-term environmental monitoring, pay a $15 million civil penalty, and take other actions to protect nearby waterways and drinking water resources,\u201d the EPA said Thursday. The\u00a0February 2023\u00a0derailment ignited a dayslong inferno, spewed poisonous fumes into the air,\u00a0killed thousands of fish\u00a0and left residents wondering if it\u2019s safe to live in East Palestine. In the weeks following the disaster, officials said tests showed the air quality and municipal water were safe. But some residents reported a variety of health problems after the derailment, including rashes, nausea, bloody noses and trouble breathing. Thursday\u2019s announcement stems from a civil lawsuit filed in March 2023. The DOJ sued Norfolk Southern on behalf of the EPA, alleging violations of the Clean Water Act from the discharge of pollutants and hazardous materials into waters. Norfolk Southern issued a statement Thursday saying it has reached an agreement with the DOJ, the EPA and the US Department of the Interior \u201cto resolve all their claims and investigations arising from the derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.\u201d The agreement, which is subject to court approval, \u201cbuilds on the significant financial commitments that the company has already made,\u201d Norfolk Southern said. In fact, Norfolk Southern said the costs associated with the agreement \u201chave either been previously estimated \u2026 or are included as part of the company\u2019s ongoing financial outlook.\u201d When asked whether the $15 million civil penalty is enough, EPA Administrator Michael Regan told reporters Norfolk Southern is \u201cgoing above and beyond and actually doing things they had not planned to do,\u201d and \u201cso I think it is a strong step forward.\u201d What Norfolk Southern must do Under the settlement, the EPA said, Norfolk Southern has agreed to: \u2022 Spend an estimated $235 million for past and future costs to help ensure the company \u2013 not taxpayers \u2013 is on the hook for all cleanup costs \u2022 Pay a $15 million civil penalty to resolve the alleged violations of the Clean Water Act \u2022 Pay $25 million for a 20-year community health program that includes medical monitoring for qualified individuals, mental health services for those living in affected counties as well as first responders who worked at the site, and a community facilitation plan to help community members in using the benefits of the program \u2022 Spend about $15 million to implement long-term monitoring of groundwater and surface water for a period of 10 years \u2022 Pay $15 million for a private drinking water monitoring fund that will continue the existing private drinking water well monitoring program for 10 years \u2022 Implement a \u201cwaterways remediation plan,\u201d with an estimated budget of $6 million, for projects in Leslie Run and Sulphur Run that will prioritize addressing historical pollution, reduce non-point source pollution through infrastructure upgrades and stormwater management projects, and restore aquatic and riparian habitat \u2022 Pay $175,000 for natural resource damages to restore, rehabilitate, replace, or acquire the equivalent of the natural resources injured as a result of the derailment \u2022 Undertake projects to improve the safety of transporting hazardous materials by rail, including the installation of \u201cadditional devices to detect overheated wheel bearings early enough to prevent derailments like the one that happened in East Palestine,\u201d the EPA said. Company reaches $600M agreement for residents In addition to the federal civil lawsuit, Norfolk Southern has reached a tentative, $600 million settlement agreement that would resolve all lawsuits covering thousands of residents within 20 miles of the site of the derailment. The agreement, which needs final approval from a judge, would also resolve personal injury claims within a 10-mile radius from the derailment, Norfolk Southern said last month. \u201cIndividuals and businesses will be able to use compensation from the settlement in any manner they see fit to address potential adverse impacts from the derailment,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis could include healthcare needs and medical monitoring, property restoration and diminution, and compensation for any net business loss.\u201d But the settlement agreement does not \u201cconstitute any admission of liability, wrongdoing, or fault,\u201d Norfolk Southern said. This week, a judge gave preliminary approval for that settlement agreement. Now, lawyers for the plaintiffs will meet residents in the coming weeks to answer questions about the settlement and how residents can submit claims for compensation. Residents and businesses within 20 miles of the derailment should expect to hear from Kroll Settlement Administration, a third party hired to execute the paymentsr. Residents and businesses that want to file a claim must do so by August 22. A hearing for final approval of the settlement is scheduled for September 25. What caused the disaster, and what\u2019s next? The National Transportation Safety Board has been investigating the cause of the derailment and has posted hundreds of pages of reports, interview transcripts and other information related to the probe. So far, the investigation has focused on a failing, flaming wheel bearing. A preliminary NTSB report said sensors detected a wheel bearing heating up miles before it eventually failed and caused the train to derail. But the detectors didn\u2019t alert the crew until it was too late. NTSB board members will return to East Palestine next month to hold a public meeting and vote on the final findings, probable cause and recommendations. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to focus on the immediate wheel bearing issue\u201d at the June 25 meeting, NTSB\u00a0Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told CNN in February. \u201cWe\u2019re going to look at hazmat impacts to the community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make safety-critical recommendations to make sure communities don\u2019t have to live through that again.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_elections-uk-mexico-what-matters", "text": "A large portion of Americans think the US government needs major, systemic reform \u2014 at least according to some polling \u2014 so it\u2019s worth looking at how other countries are doing things. Where are elections not never-ending? Anyone struggling to maintain interest in the never-ending, yearslong focus on the American presidential election might look with envy at the United Kingdom. Voters there only learned Wednesday they\u2019ll have an election in July, when rain-soaked Prime Minister Rishi Sunak gambled by announcing a snap general election for July 4. No months of primaries. No party conventions. Everyone knew something was coming \u2014 Sunak\u2019s Conservative Party had until next January to call the election, and it seems like an excessive period since the last UK-wide election in December 2019 \u2014 but clearly the campaign portion will be truncated. Sunak and his party have six weeks to make up a steep deficit in the polls or at least hope to block an outright majority for the Labour Party. RELATED: 7 questions you might have about the UK\u2019s snap July general election British voters won\u2019t directly pick a prime minister. Instead, they\u2019ll select members of Parliament. The leader of the party that wins a majority automatically becomes prime minister, and he or she assembles a government around them. It would be as if US House Speaker Mike Johnson appointed fellow lawmakers to run portions of the federal government. It can be a messy system, such as when the ruling Conservative Party churned through a series of prime ministers in recent years without having to get any input from voters. In contrast, India, which is the world\u2019s largest democracy and which, like the UK, has a parliamentary system of government, conducts its election over the course of many weeks. Results will be announced on June 4. CNN\u2019s Will Ripley was recently out on the campaign trail with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is vying for a third consecutive term. Modi\u2019s international reputation has morphed in those years from that of a reformer to that of a divisive nationalist, vilifying the country\u2019s Muslims in his bid to keep power. Where are they choosing between 2 younger women instead of 2 old men? Anyone struggling to find inspiration in the rematch of two senior citizens vying for the US presidency might look with some envy at Mexico, where the government bears many similarities to the US but where the president can only serve a single six-year term. That means Mexico President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador must step aside despite his relative popularity \u2014 and, at 70, youth \u2014 compared with the US options, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Instead of choosing between two older men, when Mexican voters go to the polls on June 2, they will be choosing between two younger women. L\u00f3pez Obrador endorsed the front-runner, Claudia Sheinbaum, the candidate from his Morena Party who previously led the Mexico City government. The candidate for an opposition coalition is Xochitl G\u00e1lvez, a former Mexican senator. Both are 61. There are other candidates, although they have little chance of winning. Tragedy struck the campaign trail Wednesday when a stage collapsed due to heavy winds, killing nine people. It\u2019s a direct election \u2014 no Electoral College \u2014 and the person who gets the most votes wins. Where do judges not have lifetime appointments? Another difference in Mexico is that Supreme Court justices serve a 15-year term instead of the justice-for-life tradition in the US. If the US had term limits, Samuel Alito would be three years off the bench and free to fly whatever flag he wanted at any of his homes. Instead, with no term limits and no binding ethics rules for US Supreme Court justices, there\u2019s nothing to keep Alito from joining opinions related to November\u2019s election. That\u2019s despite the fact that the flags outside his homes suggest he might have some preferences. Does an upside-down flag flown outside his home in Virginia days before \ufeffBiden\u2019s inauguration betray a bias? Does the flying of a flag seen at the January 6, 2021, \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally suggest a friendliness to Christian nationalists? There\u2019s arguably more evidence of a preference in the activism of fellow justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 wife, Ginni. Thomas, who was appointed to the bench in 1991 by then-President George H.W. Bush, is more than 30 years into his Supreme Court tenure. Both Thomas and Alito, in their 70s, are younger than both of the men most primary voters for the major political parties have selected to run for president. Where do they overhaul their court systems? If the nature of the US Supreme Court seems immutable and unchangeable, it\u2019s not. There\u2019s no political will to change the system, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t happen. Congress could, in theory, impose term limits on justices. It could also change the number of justices on the court, as it has in the past. There are active campaigns to change the US system, including changing the number of justices and imposing 18-year term limits. But these do not currently have major political momentum. Plus, Republicans rightly feel they will enjoy an advantage with the current system for decades to come. It\u2019s unlikely they would buy into an overhaul. The UK actually overhauled its Supreme Court with a Constitutional Reform Act back in 2005, although a major difference between the UK and the US is that the UK does not technically have a written constitution. There are plenty of cautionary tales out there as well about other forms of government. In Russia and China, where free speech and the press are seriously limited, autocratic leaders have instilled themselves and are looking to widen their worldwide influence. El Salvador had a ban on its president serving two consecutive terms, but a court full of appointees by controversial President Nayib Bukele gave him the power to seek and win reelection in February. That\u2019s not an option in the US, where the 22nd Amendment only allows for a person to serve two four-year presidential terms. Whoever wins in November \u2014 Biden or Trump \u2014 will be unable to run again.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/elections-uk-mexico-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "us"}}

The 36-year-old victim had non-life-threatening injuries and was transported to a local hospital, a news release from the police department said. Just before noon on Wednesday, the man was in the parking lot of the Alhikma Islamic Center in south Minneapolis retrieving items from his car when a minivan drove toward him at a high speed, police said. He attempted to run when the driver of the minivan swerved and struck him, according to police. \u201cBased on the information gathered by our investigators so far, I am concerned that this crime may have been motivated by bias,\u201d Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara said. \u201cWe won\u2019t tolerate any crime in our city. But hate crimes and crimes against our houses of worship are particularly troubling because of the very real widespread fear they generate and the potential division they create among our residents.\u201d The hit-and-run comes amid a surge in reported anti-Muslim bias incidents across the US in recent months \u2013 an increase the Council on American-Islamic Relations has called \u201cunprecedented.\u201d Last month, CAIR said it received 8,061 complaints of\u00a0anti-Muslim bias\u00a0incidents in 2023 \u2013 the highest number in the 28 years CAIR has tracked hate. Officers are working to locate the suspect and the van, according to the release. Police patrols have also been increased to protect those who enter and leave from the house of worship. Police department leadership is in communication with the imam and staff at the mosque, as well as community leaders, according to O\u2019Hara. Investigators are familiar with the suspect, O\u2019Hara said, as he has a \u201chistory of trespassing and acting erratically at the mosque and in the neighborhood.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Minneapolis Police Department for more information. The Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations says the victim is one of its staffers who was targeted by a man who CAIR alleges has harassed the mosque and worshipers many times in the past three years. \u201cThis apparently intentional attack outside a religious institution must be investigated as a possible hate crime,\u201d\u00a0said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR-Minnesota. \u201cWe urge stepped-up security and increased vigilance at Islamic institutions statewide.\u201d The department describes the suspect as \u201ca light complected, black male in his late 30s wearing a brown shirt and black glasses\u201d and driving a 2002 Silver Windstar minivan. The department has asked for tips from the public. The hit-and-run comes just over a year after a man allegedly set\u00a0fires at two Minneapolis mosques.

{"id": "2024_05_23_us_unc-dei-policy-vote-reaj", "text": "The Board of Governors for the University of North Carolina System  voted Thursday to repeal and replace its existing diversity and inclusion policy that applies to the 17 schools the board oversees. The new policy reverses one that was adopted in 2019 that sought to \u201cfoster an inclusive environment\u201d\u00a0and required each school to submit diversity and inclusion reports to the board of trustees every year. The new policy now requires UNC schools to \u201censure equality of all persons & viewpoints,\u201d and promote \u201cnondiscrimination in employment practices.\u201d It also mandates that all UNC schools comply with a series of amendments passed by the North Carolina General Assembly in the past year that limit what can be discussed or taught about race, racism and sex in government institutions. The policy passed with two board members \u2013 Joel Ford and Sonja Phillips Nichols \u2013 voting no. Both Ford and Nichols are Black. As the meeting convened, dozens of protestors gathered outside to rally against the proposed changes to the DEI policy. Andy Wallace, director of media relations for the UNC system, confirmed to CNN that two people were arrested outside the meeting Thursday morning. Ahead of the vote, board secretary Pearl Burris-Floyd and board member Gene Davis discussed their support for the new policy. Burris-Floyd said she retired from the field of DEI and believes there have been flaws in the way DEI has been taught. \u201cAnd that has hurt the fabric and ability to carry things forward, but it does not mean that we stop,\u201d Burris-Floyd said. The new policy, she said, will \u201cmake that path forward clearer for all people.\u201d Davis acknowledged that DEI has helped marginalized groups feel more welcomed on campus and ensures that schools are reflection of the state\u2019s diversity. Still, Davis said he had concerns. \u201cI have been made aware of things that have been done in the name of DEI that make me uncomfortable and that I believe actually result in our university communities being less welcoming to all,\u201d Davis said. He did not provide examples of the instances that made him \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d Davis said the commitments in the new policy are \u201cheartfelt by the members of this board and by the university leadership.\u201d But some students felt outraged over the board\u2019s decision, and what it signals for the future of diversity and inclusion in the UNC system. Pragya Upreti, a rising junior at UNC Chapel Hill, told CNN she attended the student press conference, as well as the protest outside the UNC Board of Governors meeting on Thursday morning. She told CNN she believes the decision to repeal the DEI policy sends a message that the board doesn\u2019t value Black and brown students. \u201cTruly this administration has failed us, and it will continue to fail generations of students who saw opportunity in diversity, equity, and inclusion,\u201d Upreti said. Chantal Stevens, executive director of the ACLU of North Carolina, called the Board\u2019s vote \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d in a statement and she asked the board to reconsider. \u201cOur university campuses must be environments where students feel included and are able to fully engage academically, and DEI programs serve an important role in achieving this,\u201d Stevens wrote in the statement. \u201cPulling funding from these programs undermines these efforts and sends a worrying message about how committed our universities are to protecting the rights of students to be free from discrimination on the basis of their\u00a0race, ethnicity, disability, or other protected classes.\u201d The vote by the 24-member UNC System Board Thursday comes as diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at public universities and corporations across the country are facing a string of attacks from critics and conservative lawmakers. The new policy follows similar moves by state governments in Florida and Texas to ban DEI efforts from public colleges and universities. Schools in the UNC System are required to comply with the new policy by September 1. The proposal does not indicate how many DEI jobs might be impacted. Earlier this month, the Board of Trustees for the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill\u00a0passed a separate proposal to divert $2.3 million from DEI programs to public safety. One trustee pointed to recent protests on campus as part of the reason the Board voted to advance the proposal to shift funding to public safety measures. \u201cWe talk about peaceful protest, but when you destroy property, or you take down the US flag, and you have to put up gates around it costs money, or deploy officers to do that,\u201d Marty Kotis the vice chair of the board\u2019s budget and finance committee said. \u201cNorth Carolinians are watching all of this and they are not happy. And\u00a0[I] think it\u2019s imperative that we have the proper resources for our law enforcement to protect the campus, and that means our property and that means our flag as well.\u201d Major universities including the University of Florida and University of Texas at Austin have been forced to dismantle their DEI offices and programs and cut jobs to comply with state laws and regulations. Since 2023, 14\u00a0anti-DEI bills that\u00a0target programs at colleges have been signed into law,\u00a0according to a tally by the Chronicle of Higher\u00a0Education. North Carolina lawmakers passed a bill last year that bans diversity statements from state agencies, the University of North Carolina system, and community colleges. \u2018You will be able to feel the difference\u2019 The anti-DEI proposals at both the system-wide level and UNC at Chapel Hill\u2019s campus have left students worried about the future of diversity programs on campus if they are enacted. Ahead of the meeting, UNC System students gathered in Raleigh to speak out against the proposed changes.\u00a0 \u201cTo gut the DEI policy is to deny students both present and future of their right to a high-quality education,\u201d one student said, according to CNN affiliate WRAL. \u201cDiversity and equity and inclusion are foundational to education.\u201d\u00a0 Another student said she attends UNC Ashville and is concerned that enrollment will decline at UNC System schools because DEI programs are banned.\u00a0 \u201cPassing this anti-DEI policy will be a kiss of death for some of these systems and institutions,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd will be monumentally detrimental to future student interest to apply for and much less attend these UNC System Schools\u2026. We will all suffer.\u201d Toby Posel, co-policy chair for UNC Chapel Hill\u2019s Affirmative Action Coalition and a co-founder of the student organization TransparUNCy, said he was \u201cextremely disgusted and disappointed\u201d at both the UNC System and UNC board members for going against DEI. Posel said he is\u00a0concerned that the UNC system\u2019s anti-DEI policy leaves room for interpretation and it is unknown how jobs, programs and offices might be impacted. But regardless, Posel said the absence of DEI will make the campuses unwelcoming for people of color, LGBTQ+ students and first-generation college students. \u201cYou will be able to feel the difference,\u201d Posel said. \u201cIt will be significantly less welcoming, less safe, less supportive. Their academic lives are going to suffer, social lives are going suffer. This is a very clear statement from the highest level of university governance in North Carolina that (they) don\u2019t care about those students.\u201d Julian Taylor, executive board member of the Affirmative Action Coalition and a co-founder of TransparUNCy,\u00a0said he believes both boards are taking a political stance against DEI that aligns with a conservative movement instead of being neutral. The UNC Board of Governors is made up of 24 members who are elected by the Republican-led North Carolina General Assembly. The UNC Chapel Hill Board of Trustees has 15 members, including eight elected by the Board of Governors, six appointed by the General Assembly and one spot for the president of student government. Taylor said DEI initiatives have allowed UNC Chapel Hill to reckon with its history of slavery on campus. He worries that cutting DEI programs will impact curriculum and prevent this history from being taught. \u201cDEI is a small step in serving racial justice,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut a lot of this is about the larger, overarching debate about what we do to try to rectify past injustices. And this is a pretty clear answer from UNC and the UNC Board of Trustees saying that the answer to that question is \u2018absolutely nothing.\u2019\u201d CNN\u2019s Devon M.

While speaking remotely via webcam at VivaTech 2024 in Paris, Musk described a future where jobs would be \u201coptional.\u201d \u201cIf you want to do a job that\u2019s kinda like a hobby, you can do a job,\u201d Musk said. \u201cBut otherwise, AI and the robots will provide any goods and services that you want.\u201d For this scenario to work, he said, there would need to be \u201cuniversal high income\u201d \u2013 not to be confused with universal basic income, although he did not share what that could look like. (UBI refers to the government giving a certain amount of money to everyone regardless of how much they earn.) \u201cThere would be no shortage of goods or services,\u201d he said. AI capabilities have surged over the past few years, fast enough that regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use the technology responsibly. Concerns also continue to mount over how various industries and jobs will change as AI proliferates in the market. In January, researchers at MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab found workplaces are adopting AI much more slowly than some had expected and feared. The report also said the majority of jobs previously identified as vulnerable to AI were not economically beneficial for employers to automate at that time. Experts also largely believe that many jobs that require a high emotional intelligence and human interaction will not need replacing, such as mental health professionals, creatives and teachers. Musk has been outspoken about his concerns around AI. During the keynote on Thursday, he called the technology his biggest fear. He cited the \u201cCulture Book Series\u201d by Ian Banks, a utopian fictionalized look at a society run by advanced technology, as the most realistic and \u201cthe best envisioning of a future AI.\u201d In a job-free future, though, Musk questioned whether people would feel emotionally fulfilled. \u201cThe question will really be one of meaning\u00a0 \u2013 if the computer and robots can do everything better than you, does your life have meaning?\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cI do think there\u2019s perhaps still a role for humans in this \u2013 in that we may give AI meaning.\u201d He also used his stage time to urge parents to limit the amount of social media that children can see because \u201cthey\u2019re being programmed by a dopamine-maximizing AI.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/tech/elon-musk-ai-your-job/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "us"}}

Here\u2019s what else you need to know to\u00a0Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 1. Trump Former President Donald Trump is falsely claiming that President Joe Biden authorized the Department of Justice to have him assassinated when raiding his Mar-a-Lago estate in 2022 for classified documents. Followers of Trump received a campaign email this week addressed from \u201cPresident Trump,\u201d with the subject line: \u201cThey were authorized to shoot me!\u201d The email appeared to reference a recently unsealed document outlining FBI procedures that included standard language about the \u201cuse of force\u201d in searches.

Extreme weather Destructive storms and tornadoes in Iowa this week have killed at least five people and injured dozens of others, according to officials. The tornado that struck Greenfield, Iowa, on Tuesday \u2014 about 50 miles southwest of Des Moines \u2014 is estimated to have been at least an EF3 and the deadliest of the year. Footage from the region shows homes and other structures were obliterated and communities were blanketed with debris. Tornado reports have skyrocketed well above average in recent weeks as the typically busiest period of severe weather season unfolds. More than 800 tornadoes have been reported in 2024, making it one of the most active years for twisters on record. 3. Uvalde Nineteen families of the students and teachers killed or injured during the 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, have reached a $2 million settlement with the city. The families also announced plans to file a lawsuit against 92 officers with the Texas Department of Public Safety, the school district and individual employees. The settlement and latest legal action comes days before the second anniversary of the shooting in which an 18-year-old stormed into the school, killed 19 children and two teachers and barricaded himself in a classroom. A total of 376 law enforcement officers rushed to the school to respond, but ultimately none of them breached the door to the classroom to confront the shooter for 77 minutes. 4. Student debt relief The Biden administration on Wednesday announced an additional $7.7 billion in student debt relief for around 160,000 Americans. \u201cI will never stop working to cancel student debt \u2014 no matter how many times Republican elected officials try to stop us,\u201d President Joe Biden said in a statement. Biden has faced blowback from conservative lawmakers who accuse the administration of transferring the burden to taxpayers and undermining the Supreme Court, which blocked the White House\u2019s student loan forgiveness plan last year. Borrowers affected by the latest round of debt relief were approved through the administration\u2019s SAVE Plan, other income-driven repayment programs or initiatives for qualifying public service workers. 5. Ticketmaster The Justice Department and several states are expected to file a lawsuit against Live Nation as soon as today, citing alleged antitrust violations due to the market dominance of its Ticketmaster unit. A successful antitrust case could potentially lead to sweeping changes in the market for live events \u2014 an industry that came under intense scrutiny in 2022 after glitches at Ticketmaster blocked millions from purchasing tickets for Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cEras\u201d tour.

{"id": "2024_05_22_us_uvalde-school-district-police-chief-resignation", "text": "The chief of police for Uvalde schools has submitted his resignation more than a year after he replaced the man who held the position during the 2022 school massacre in the Texas city, according to a school official\u2019s statement obtained by CNN affiliate KSAT Tuesday. The resignation of Joshua Gutierrez, chief of police for the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District, will be presented for approval at a June 17 school board meeting, according to district spokesperson Anne Marie Espinoza. If approved, his last day will be June 26, according to the KSAT report. Details about the reasons for the resignation weren\u2019t immediately available. CNN has sought comment from Gutierrez and the school district. \u201cWe thank Chief Gutierrez for his dedicated leadership and guidance in reestablishing the Uvalde CISD Police Department,\u201d Espinoza said in the statement. \u201cHis contributions have been instrumental in enhancing the safety and well-being of our students, staff, and school community.\u201d Gutierrez replaced Pete Arredondo, who was fired in August 2022 following scrutiny of his actions during the May 2022 shooting in which 19 students and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary School. Law enforcement officers waited more than an hour before entering adjoining classrooms where the gunman was and killing him. A US Department of Justice report said officers had many opportunities to intervene to stop the bloodshed far earlier. Arredondo was\u00a0seen on police body-worn cameras\u00a0giving orders and receiving information during the response, but he has said he did not see himself as the incident commander. Gutierrez was approved unanimously as the interim police chief in November 2022, and was named\u00a0permanent\u00a0chief in March 2023. \u201cThis is our first step (we are) taking to rebuild our school district police force,\u201d Gary Patterson, then the interim superintendent, said when Gutierrez was named interim chief. As interim police chief, Gutierrez focused on hiring qualified officers, conducting tactical cross-training with local law enforcement and engaging students and the community, according to KSAT, which reported he\u2019d previously worked at several other school districts. \u201cI have the ability to come out here and help the community heal, help our community heal, and the abilities to reestablish a good foundation for our police department,\u201d Gutierrez said in December 2022, according to KSAT. The district has begun a search to replace Gutierrez and has posted the job on its website. \u201cUnder general supervision, this officer performs tasks related to ensuring the safety of UCISD students, staff, and visitors,\u201d the posting says. \u201cAdditionally, the officer provides classroom presentations, counsels students and parents, engages students through mentoring, and serves as a positive role model to help promote healthy relationships between youth and law enforcement.\u201d Among the requirements for the position, the district is looking for someone with a minimum of five years of senior level experience directing law enforcement operations, according to the posting. A candidate should have the \u201cability to effectively deal with personal danger which may include sudden exposure to armed persons,\u201d the posting says. \u201cWe are committed to finding a successor who will continue to uphold the standards of safety and security that our school community deserves,\u201d Espinoza said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/us/uvalde-school-district-police-chief-resignation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_us_dali-ship-baltimore-bridge-refloats", "text": "Almost two months after its devastating collision with a Baltimore bridge, the trapped cargo ship Dali will refloat and travel to the Baltimore marine terminal on Monday morning, officials said. After weeks of salvage operations, the Dali can finally be relocated thanks to a\u00a0series of controlled explosions\u00a0which broke apart a massive piece of the Francis Scott Bridge that had been stuck atop the ship\u2019s bow, officials said. An estimated 500-foot section of the bridge weighing 8-12 million pounds was removed from the ship. \u201cThe\u00a0refloat\u00a0and transit sequence is deliberately designed to ensure all response personnel around the M/V Dali maintain control of the vessel, from\u00a0refloat, transit to, and berthing at a local marine terminal,\u201d Unified Command said in a\u00a0news release\u00a0Saturday. Conditions permitting, the massive ship\u2019s journey will begin around 5 a.m. on Monday during peak high tide, according to Unified Command. Crews will begin prepping the ship about 18 hours before \u2013 about midday on Sunday \u2013 to take full advantage of the high tide, officials added. Up to five tugboats will then tow and push the Dali about two and a half miles to the\u00a0Seagirt Marine Terminal in Baltimore, the release said. It will take an estimated three hours to transport the 984-foot, 106,000-ton ship. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said Sunday he expects to have the channel reopened by the end of the month. \u201cI\u2019m proud that we\u2019re on track that by the end of May we\u2019ll have that federal channel reopened,\u201d Moore said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cAnd within days, we\u2019re going to have that massive vessel, the\u00a0Dali, out of that federal channel.\u201d The cargo ship collided with the bridge in the early hours of March 26, killing six maintenance workers and causing most of the structure to collapse into the Patapsco River. The disaster shut down most shipping to and from the Port of Baltimore. The crash has prompted multiple investigations, including by the FBI and the US Coast Guard. The ship\u2019s 21-member crew has remained onboard since the collapse, including during the planned explosions on May 13. The ship\u2019s management company told CNN this week the crew will remain on the vessel for \u201cthe foreseeable future.\u201d According to Barbara Shipley, mid-Atlantic labor representative for the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation, there is no plan for what the crew will do once the Dali is escorted back to port on Monday. She said the crew\u2019s visas have all expired and the union is waiting for direction from immigration authorities to figure out next steps. She told CNN the crew members are trying to keep their spirits high despite being disconnected from their friends and families. The FBI confiscated the men\u2019s cell phones as part of their ongoing investigation. \u201cIt\u2019s been since April 15, they still haven\u2019t received their cell phones,\u201d Shipley said. \u201cNo one has received their cell phones, they did receive some SIM cards, but not all.\u201d Shipley said her priority \u201cwould be to have the decisions made quickly, which crew members will need to stay behind, and\u00a0which crew members can go home, and it\u2019s important to get these gentlemen back home to their families,\u201d Shipley said. \u201cAs far as I know, no one\u2019s been charged with anything and we\u2019re holding them.

{"id": "2024_05_20_us_family-heirloom-reunited-social-media", "text": "When her mother died two years ago, Celia Bashaw began dreaming about art, and not just any art. Her thoughts were fixed on an heirloom her great uncle, Chuck Perkins, had carved. Her mother and grandmother had loved it. But Bashaw couldn\u2019t find it. She knew it had been picked up after her grandmother\u2019s death when the family was going through her belongings, 15 years ago. And she knew her great uncle, who lived in Vermont, had given it away there, hoping the new owners would hold on to it. As it turned out, they sold it. So she decided to make a Facebook post in a group for Vermonters, hoping she could track down the buyers and get the piece back. \u201c(My mom) had a whole chest of photos. A bunch of photographs of everybody in the family and all the things that were really special to her.\u201d Bashaw told CNN. \u201cIn those photos, there were very good, prominent photos of the family heirloom that I was looking for. Before, I hadn\u2019t had any good photos of it. I just had a description.\u201d Bashaw attached three photos of the engraving, which portrayed a leopard lounging in a tree. The post was shared about 600 times, according to CNN affiliate WCAX. Some commenters noted the piece looked different from the one Bashaw had originally posted. Bashaw replied while it had been through some wear and tear, she was able to confirm it was the same work from her great uncle\u2019s woodburned signature on the back. \u201cIt\u2019s really a one-of-a-kind engraving, so when this man sent me a picture of it, I was like, \u2018There\u2019s no way somebody did something so identical to my uncle\u2019s carving,\u2019\u201d Bashaw said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be the one, like there\u2019s no way I can let this go.\u201d Then, in Rutland, Vermont, Chris McKirryher and her partner, Phil Matte, saw the Facebook post and realized they had the solution to Bashaw\u2019s long-shot quest. At a yard sale in Pittsford, Vermont, the couple had bought the carving. They arranged a meeting and Bashaw made the two-and-a-half hour drive from Plattsburgh, New York, to Vermont. She told CNN McKirryher and Matte were \u201cjust so darling\u201d and she \u201cloved them immediately.\u201d Despite being nervous about meeting strangers from the internet, Bashaw found the duo were \u201cso nice and such great people.\u201d \u201cWith all the bad news and everything going around, it\u2019s good to see something really nice,\u201d Matte told WCAX, who agreed to sell it back to Bashaw. In an updated post to the Facebook group, Bashaw shared her excitement at being reunited with her great uncle\u2019s artwork, thanking her friends, family and community for sharing and helping her find the piece. \u201cI\u2019m over the moon happy (and) lucky.\u201d she wrote. Now, Bashaw feels like a piece of her mother and grandmother has come back home. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice because I don\u2019t have very many things of my mother or my grandmother and actually, it\u2019s been extremely hard for me to even find a picture of me and my grandmother together. We were so close, and it just makes me so sad.\u201d she said. \u201cHaving a piece of art that was so important to them finally be back and in my grasp\u2026 I wish I could tell my mom about it because she would just scream, just like I did \u2026 I hope she can see it now that I have it back because she was looking for it too,\u201d she added. Bashaw, an artist herself, plans to put the carving back in her grandfather\u2019s house instead of in her own. \u201cHe has the wall still where there\u2019s like, almost a frame outline of where it used to be, so it\u2019s like as soon, I put it there, it\u2019s just supposed to be there. So, I think it\u2019ll bring some solace to my grandpa, too.\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/us/family-heirloom-reunited-social-media/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_23_us_nc-confederate-slaves-monument-lawsuit-reaj", "text": "Residents of a small county in North Carolina\u00a0filed\u00a0a federal lawsuit Tuesday to have a\u00a0Confederate-era monument to \u201cfaithful slaves\u201d removed from outside the county courthouse. The monument\u00a0in Tyrrell County, North Carolina, features a Confederate soldier on top of a pedestal with the inscription \u201cIn appreciation of our faithful slaves\u201d written underneath. The lawsuit, filed in the Eastern District of North Carolina, was brought by\u00a0a group called\u00a0The Concerned Citizens of Tyrrell County. The plaintiffs\u00a0claim the public monument is in violation of\u00a0the\u00a0Equal\u00a0Protection\u00a0Clause of the 14th\u00a0Amendment\u00a0because it \u201cexpresses a racially discriminatory message.\u201d The inscription on the statue promotes a \u201cpro-slavery message\u00a0and a pro-Confederate\u00a0message,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Jaelyn Miller, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told CNN she feels county commissioners have a responsibility to ensure that racist messages are not being displayed to the Black community. \u201cThis is sort of the only monument in the country on public land that textually\u00a0endorses slavery,\u201d Miller said. Ian Mance, another attorney for the plaintiffs, said the historical record is clear that the monument was meant to send a message. \u201cIt was put up in the front yard of what was soon to be the\u00a0Tyrrell\u00a0County Courthouse, which opened a few months later, to communicate to people that members of the Black community could not expect to get justice inside of that courthouse,\u201d he said. The lawsuit alleges the construction of the monument and the county\u2019s continued maintenance \u201ccommunicates, on behalf of local government, the idea that Tyrrell\u2019s institutions regard Black people\u2019s rightful place as one of subservience and obedience\u201d and that \u201cBlack people who were enslaved in Tyrrell County preferred their slavery to freedom.\u201d The lawsuit also claims that the county\u2019s display of the message has \u201cincite(d) racial hostility\u201d and endangers the plaintiffs\u2019 safety. The monument has been standing since 1902 and\u00a0the lawsuit\u00a0is the latest move in a decades-long battle to have it removed\u00a0from courthouse grounds. Mance said\u00a0the\u00a0plaintiffs have been attending commission meetings since the 1990s and holding demonstrations since 2019. \u201cLitigation was our last resort,\u201d Sherryreed\u00a0Robinson, one of the plaintiffs said in a\u00a0news release announcing the suit.\u00a0\u201cWe have peacefully voiced our objections for years. This monument says our ancestors preferred slavery to freedom. That\u2019s a false and hurtful message for the government to communicate.\u201d CNN has reached out to Tyrrell County Commissioners for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/us/nc-confederate-slaves-monument-lawsuit-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_politics_marines-osprey-crash-boeing-rolls-royce-bell-textron-lawsuit", "text": "The families of four US Marines killed in a 2022 crash of an Osprey aircraft are suing Boeing, Bell Textron Inc. and Rolls Royce, alleging that the companies failed to address known issues with the aircraft that resulted in the crash. The lawsuit, filed on Thursday, focuses on a MV-22B Osprey crash in June 2022, when five Marines stationed at Marine Corps Air Station Camp Pendleton, California, were killed while conducting a training mission. A Marine Corps investigation determined last July that the accident was caused by a mechanical failure and that there \u201cwas no error on the part of the pilots and aircrew and nothing they could have done to anticipate or prevent this mishap.\u201d \u201cThey were conducting routine flight operations in accordance with applicable regulations when this catastrophic and unanticipated mechanical failure occurred,\u201d the Marine Corps\u00a0said in 2023. The five Marines killed were Capts. Nicholas Losapio and John Sax;, Cpls. Nathan Carlson and Seth Rasmuson; and Lance Cpl. Evan Strickland. The lawsuit, filed by the families of Sax, Carlson, Strickland and Rasmuson, accuses Boeing, Bell Textron, Rolls Royce Corps and Rolls Royce North America of negligence, negligent and fraudulent misrepresentation, and the failure to warn. Tim Loranger, the lawyer representing the families in the lawsuit, told CNN on Thursday that ultimately the lawsuit alleges that the aircraft\u00a0the Marines were on was known to have a defect but \u201cinsufficient steps have been taken to correct it.\u201d \u201cWe allege they had information they didn\u2019t disclose,\u201d Loranger said. \u201cAnd here we are today as a result.\u201d The mechanical failure in June 2023 involved the dual hard clutch engagement, which the Marine Corps said \u201ccreated a Single Engine and Interconnect Drive System (Single Engine/IDS) failure.\u201d The failure ultimately resulted in an \u201cunrecoverable departure from controlled flight, resulting in the tragic crash.\u201d \u201cDue to their defective products, breaches of contracts, breaches of warranties, wrongful actions and omissions, the defendants named herein caused the accident and the tragic deaths of Plaintiffs\u2019 decedents, five fine young United States Marines,\u201d the lawsuit says. Boeing, Bell Textron and Rolls Royce have not yet responded to request for comment from CNN.\u00a0The lawsuit comes as Boeing has been under scrutiny and is expected to present a plan to fix quality issues on its assembly line next week, after a hole blew open on the side of a Boeing 737 Max mid-flight in January. The lawsuit comes months after another deadly V-22 Osprey crash off the coast of Japan, which resulted in the deaths of eight US Special Operations airmen. The US military\u00a0grounded\u00a0its entire fleet of V-22 Ospreys in December as a result. That grounding guidance\u00a0was lifted\u00a0in March this year; officials said at the time an investigation identified a \u201cmateriel failure\u201d responsible for the crash. Col. Brian Taylor, the program manager of the Naval Air Systems Command V-22 joint program office, told reporters in March that the crash resulted from an \u201cunprecedented\u201d component failure, though he declined to say what component specifically failed or how. The deadly crash near Japan had been the latest in a string of Osprey incidents. In August 2023,\u00a0three US Marines were killed\u00a0when a MV-22B Osprey crashed during military exercises in Australia. And in March 2022, just months before the five US Marines were killed in California, four US service members died in a MV-22 crash during a NATO exercise. Loranger told CNN that it\u2019s unclear whether there is a common thread between the June 2023 crash and the other recent incidents but said the point for the families in the lawsuit is to \u201cget to the bottom of what happened, why did this aircraft crash, why have other Ospreys crashed, and what has been done to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s making sure when families send their Marines or airmen off to do their job, that they aren\u2019t going to get the knock on their door because something broke in the (aircraft),\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/politics/marines-osprey-crash-boeing-rolls-royce-bell-textron-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_business_takeaways-house-campus-antisemitism-hearing", "text": "The House Committee on Education and the Workforce\u2019s hearing on campus antisemitism Thursday came with no shortage of fiery exchanges between lawmakers and the heads of Northwestern University, Rutgers University and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). But unlike two prior hearings, Thursday\u2019s was the first to take place after a wave of pro-Palestinian encampments spread across campuses nationwide, disrupting learning and commencement ceremonies and ultimately causing many students to feel unsafe. Here are some of the most important takeaways from the hearing that lasted several hours. University heads can\u2019t win Northwestern President Michael Schill and Rutgers University President Dr. Jonathan Holloway negotiated with protesters rather than authorizing police to disband encampments, which UCLA Chancellor Gene Block ultimately did. Both approaches received considerable rebuke from lawmakers on the Republican-led committee. Schill and Holloway were accused of being complicit with protesters, though some Democratic lawmakers found their approaches admirable. \u201cI for one am interested in hearing and learning about what successful negotiation and de-escalation looks like in the context of protecting students and free speech,\u201d Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington state, said. Meanwhile, Block was criticized by some lawmakers for not authorizing police to step in sooner. Block agreed more action should have been taken earlier, saying, \u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, we should have been prepared to immediately remove the encampment if and when the safety of our community was put at risk.\u201d A lot of investigations but limited consequences yet In one of the hearing\u2019s tensest exchanges, Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik slammed Schill\u00a0for not taking any action against someone who allegedly told a Jewish student to \u201cgo back to Germany and get gassed.\u201d Schill said that he heard about that happening and \u201cit is being investigated.\u201d\u00a0So far, no students who are being investigated for various alleged acts of antisemitism have been expelled or suspended, he said. Rutgers\u2019 Holloway and UCLA\u2019s Block similarly said the universities have many active investigations underway. Holloway said his school has suspended four people and 19 others have received additional disciplinary actions. A bounty of lawyerly responses If you tuned in to Thursday\u2019s hearing and thought the responses university heads gave were pre-rehearsed, it\u2019s because they likely were. The three university heads at the hearing had the advantage of learning from the prior campus hearings. All were especially keen on not repeating the mistake made by University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill and other school presidents who did not explicitly say calls for the genocide of Jews violated their codes of conduct. But the school leaders on Thursday still leaned into giving lawyerly responses, especially in tense lines of questioning to avoid being cornered into taking a stance on divisive issues. For instance, when Holloway was asked if he thought Israel\u2019s government was genocidal he responded, \u201cSir, I don\u2019t have an opinion on Israel\u2019s \u2014 in terms of that phrase.\u201d Meanwhile, Schill said more than once that he would not comment on individual students or faculty members in the hearing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/business/takeaways-house-campus-antisemitism-hearing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "us"}}
