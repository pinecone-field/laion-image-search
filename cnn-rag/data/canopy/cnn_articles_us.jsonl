The \u201cAtmosFEAR\u201d ride at Oaks Amusement Park \u201cstopped at the apex position while operating in the 360-degree setting, suspending 28 riders upside down,\u201d the park wrote on X. Portland Fire & Rescue responded around 3:15 p.m. local time after the ride got stuck, according to a\u00a0post on X.  \u201cPortland Fire is en route to Oaks Park for a ride that is stuck, with multiple riders. At this point there are no indications of injury,\u201d the fire department said. Jordan Harding, 18, thought she would never see her family again while trapped on the ride. \u201cAt first I was like freaking out, but then I was like it\u2019s fine. I thought we\u2019d come down in 10 seconds, 15 seconds, whatever,\u201d Harding told CNN. She said 20 seconds turned into three minutes, then riders started to panic, scream, and call for help. \u201cWhat I was thinking is just like I\u2019m never going to see my dad again. I\u2019m never going to see my brother again. Like I\u2019m never going to go college. I\u2019m never going to get married. I\u2019m just never going to have these major milestones,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m 18, I have so much life left to live. Like, I\u2019m going to die like this, are you joking? I haven\u2019t even been graduated a week.\u201d Portland Fire said it worked with park engineers to lower the ride manually but also prepared the high-angle rope rescue team \u201cto affect rescues with the ride stuck, as is, if they are unable to manually lower the ride.\u201d The ride was manually lowered around 3:24 p.m., according to the fire department. The riders were then evacuated and medically evaluated. One rider was transported to the hospital for further evaluation and the others were released by medics, according to the park. Daniel Allen, who was on the ride when it stopped, told CNN affiliate KATU that the restriction of the harness on his chest made it difficult for him to breathe because he has asthma. \u201cI was crying, not of joy, not of anything, I was just crying. I was more happy, I was alive. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever appreciated my life more,\u201d Allen said. The AtmosFEAR ride, in which riders can choose to spin either 360 or 180 degrees, has been closed until further notice, according to the park\u2019s website. It has been in operation since 2021 and the park had no issues with it, according to the statement from the park. The park said it will work with the manufacturer and state inspectors to identify what caused the incident. Friday was the opening day for the 2024 season of the amusement park, according to the park\u2019s\u00a0Facebook page. The park is located just south of downtown Portland along the Willamette River.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/us/portland-amusement-park-riders-stuck-upside-down/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_17_us_missouri-sandra-hemme-conviction-overturned-killing", "text": "(AP) \u2014 A judge has overturned the conviction of a Missouri woman who was a psychiatric patient when she incriminated herself in a 1980 killing that her attorneys argue was actually committed by\u00a0a now-discredited police officer. Judge Ryan Horsman ruled late Friday that Sandra Hemme, who has spent 43 years behind bars, had established evidence of actual innocence and must be freed within 30 days unless prosecutors retry her. He said her trial counsel was ineffective and prosecutors failed to disclose evidence that would have helped her. Her attorneys say this is the longest time a woman has been incarcerated for a wrongful conviction. They filed a motion seeking her immediate release. \u201cWe are grateful to the Court for acknowledging the grave injustice Ms. Hemme has endured for more than four decades,\u201d her attorneys said in a statement, promising to keep up their efforts to dismiss the charges and reunite Hemme with her family. A spokesperson for Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey didn\u2019t immediately respond to a text or email message seeking comment Saturday. Hemme was shackled in leather wrist restraints and so heavily sedated that she \u201ccould not hold her head up straight\u201d or \u201carticulate anything beyond monosyllabic responses\u201d when she was first questioned about the death of 31-year-old library worker Patricia Jeschke, according to her lawyers with the New York-based Innocence Project. They alleged in a petition seeking her exoneration that authorities ignored Hemme\u2019s \u201cwildly contradictory\u201d statements and suppressed evidence implicating Michael Holman, a then-police officer who tried to use the slain woman\u2019s credit card. The judge wrote that \u201cno evidence whatsoever outside of Ms. Hemme\u2019s unreliable statements connects her to the crime.\u201d \u201cIn contrast,\u201d he added, \u201cthis Court finds that the evidence directly ties Holman to this crime and murder scene.\u201d It started on Nov. 13, 1980, when Jeschke missed work. Her worried mother climbed through a window at her apartment and discovered her daughter\u2019s nude body on the floor, surrounded by blood. Her hands were tied behind her back with a telephone cord and a pair of pantyhose was wrapped around her throat. A knife was under her head. The brutal killing grabbed headlines, with detectives working 12-hour days to solve it. But Hemme wasn\u2019t on their radar until she showed up nearly two weeks later at the home of a nurse who once treated her, carrying a knife and refusing to leave. Police found her in a closet, and took her back to St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, the latest in a string of hospitalizations that began when she started hearing voices at the age of 12. She had been discharged from that very hospital the day before Jeschke\u2019s body was found, showing up at her parents\u2019 house later that night after hitchhiking more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) across the state. The timing seemed suspicious to law enforcement. As the interrogations began, Hemme was being treated with antipsychotic drugs that had triggered involuntary muscle spasms. She complained that her eyes were rolling back in her head, the petition said. Detectives noted that Hemme seemed \u201cmentally confused\u201d and not fully able to comprehend their questions. \u201cEach time the police extracted a statement from Ms. Hemme it changed dramatically from the last, often incorporating explanations of facts the police had just recently uncovered,\u201d her attorneys wrote. Eventually, she claimed to have watched a man named Joseph Wabski kill Jeschke. Wabski, whom she met when they stayed in the state hospital\u2019s detoxification unit at the same time, was charged with capital murder. But prosecutors quickly dropped the case upon learning he was at an alcohol treatment center in Topeka, Kansas, at the time. But police also were starting to look at another suspect \u2014 one of their own. About a month after the killing, Holman was arrested for falsely reporting that his pickup truck had been stolen and collecting an insurance payout. It was the same truck spotted near the crime scene, and the officer\u2019s alibi that he spent the night with a woman at a nearby motel couldn\u2019t be confirmed. Furthermore, he had tried to use Jeschke\u2019s credit card at a camera store in Kansas City, Missouri, on the same day her body was found. Holman, who ultimately was fired and died in 2015, said he found the card in a purse that had been discarded in a ditch. During a search of Holman\u2019s home, police found a pair of gold horseshoe-shaped earrings in a closet, along with jewelry stolen from another woman during a burglary earlier that year. Jeschke\u2019s father said he recognized the earrings as a pair he bought for his daughter. But then the four-day investigation into Holman ended abruptly, many of the details uncovered never given to Hemme\u2019s attorneys. Hemme, meanwhile, was growing desperate. She wrote to her parents on Christmas Day 1980, saying, \u201cEven though I\u2019m innocent, they want to put someone away, so they can say the case is solved.\u201d She said she might as well change her plea to guilty. \u201cJust let it end,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d And that is what she did the following spring, when she agreed to plead guilty to capital murder in exchange for the death penalty being taken off the table. Even that was a challenge; the judge initially rejected her guilty plea because she couldn\u2019t share enough details about what happened, saying: \u201cI really didn\u2019t know I had done it until like three days later, you know, when it came out in the paper and on the news.\u201d Her attorney told her that her chance to not be sentenced to death was to get the judge to accept her guilty plea. After a recess and some coaching, she provided more information. That plea later was thrown out on appeal. But she was convicted again in 1985 after a one-day trial in which jurors weren\u2019t told of what her current attorneys describe as \u201cgrotesquely coercive\u201d interrogations. Larry Harman, who helped Hemme get her initial guilty plea thrown out and later became a judge, said in the petition that he believed she was innocent. \u201cThe system,\u201d he said, \u201cfailed her at every opportunity.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/us/missouri-sandra-hemme-conviction-overturned-killing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_us_nyc-lgbtq-pride-month-flags-vandalized", "text": "Flags dedicated to celebrating LGBTQ Pride Month were vandalized this week in New York City, according to the city\u2019s police department. The colorful flags near the Stonewall National Monument, located in Manhattan\u2019s Greenwich Village neighborhood and dedicated to a turning point in the modern LGBTQ civil rights movement, were removed and damaged sometime on Thursday night, the New York City Police Department said in a statement to CNN. Authorities received a report early Friday, shortly before 8 a.m. ET about flags missing from the park where the monument is located. A preliminary investigation found an unidentified person had removed and destroyed 160 flags in the area around 8 p.m. Thursday, according to police. \u201cThe individual then fled the location to parts unknown,\u201d the statement said. There were no injuries reported and authorities have not made any arrests. The investigation is ongoing, the police department said Friday evening. New York City Mayor Eric Adams commented on the vandalism in a post on X, formerly Twitter, writing: \u201cHate has no place in our city, and nothing will change that.\u201d Adams on Thursday celebrated June\u2019s LGBTQ Pride Month at a gathering at his residence at Gracie Mansion Conservancy. \u201cWe love the LGBTQ+ community and celebrate them during Pride and all year round,\u201d the mayor wrote on X. \u201cWe\u2019ll always have your back, and we will bring whoever defaced the Stonewall monument to justice.\u201d The mayor\u2019s office is working closely with the NYPD to identify the person responsible for the vandalism, which Adams referred to as a \u201cheinous act\u201d in a statement to CNN. New York Attorney General Letitia James called the vandalism \u201cdisgusting\u201d in response to New York City Council member Erik Bottcher sharing images of the damaged and broken flags in an X post. Bottcher\u2019s post showed a pile of LGBTQ flags on the ground near the Stonewall monument and Christopher Park. \u201cAnyone who thinks this will intimidate our community is badly mistaken,\u201d Bottcher wrote. In 2016, President Barack Obama designated the Stonewall National Monument area, which includes Christopher Park the historic Stonewall Inn, as the first US national monument to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. The area was the site of the 1969 Stonewall uprising and protests often cited as a flashpoint for LGBTQ rights in the US. A June 1969 police raid of the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar, prompted patrons to fight back and eventually led to the first gay and lesbian rights march. Last June, the NYPD said its Hate Crime Task Force investigated at least three incidents during Pride Month during which the Stonewall National Monument\u2019s flags were damaged or removed, CNN previously reported. CNN\u2019s Meron Moges-Gerbi and Nicole Chavez contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/us/nyc-lgbtq-pride-month-flags-vandalized/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_us_lesbian-bars-south-cec", "text": "Trying to find Arcana is like going on a treasure hunt. North Carolina\u2019s only known lesbian bar is tucked away somewhere on West Main Street in Durham, in one of those configurations that confuses navigation apps and results in several minutes of wide-eyed wandering. It\u2019s there, though, around the back of a building, behind some of the city\u2019s buzziest restaurants. A circular sign signals the entrance across from the railroad tracks that run through Durham. Then, it\u2019s down a flight of pitch-black stairs \u2014 perfumed by the Indian fusion restaurant above \u2014 and you\u2019re inside a candlelit space decorated with mismatching antique furniture and local art. Sade and Tracy Chapman croon from the speakers overhead, and owner Erin Karcher is behind the bar, chatting with two women seated on the stools in front of her. They address her by name. \u201cThe Lion King\u201d musical is playing at the nearby Durham Performing Arts Center, and Karcher has created a lineup of craft cocktails for the occasion: the Nala, the Sarafina and Pride Rock. A silver jar sits on the bottle shelf behind her, with a handwritten paper sign reading \u201cTips for Tits;\u201d inches away hangs a palm-sized transgender flag. Arcana is part of what has been dubbed a dying breed in the country: a lesbian-specific bar, of which there are only 33, according to The Lesbian Bar Project. While not an official tally, the Lesbian Bar Project aims to amplify and keep track of these spaces, which can register with the project.\u00a0 On a slow Wednesday evening, with just a handful of customers stopping in for a drink, Arcana is operating at a low, comfortable hum. In the back, a burlesque class is in session, and a tarot card reader wearing a rainbow face mask sits in the corner near the bar, offering her services. Before she started doing tarot readings at Arcana, Joy Carter, who lives in neighboring Raleigh, would often make the trek out to Durham just to stop in. \u201cWhen I was here, it made me wish I could be here more, because I knew I was safe,\u201d Carter, who identifies as queer, said. \u201cI am both safe and comfortable on a lot of fronts, in a lot of ways that I\u2019m not necessarily safe and comfortable in the world outside the door.\u201d Carter isn\u2019t the only one who feels that way. Arcana, which opened in 2015, also hosts regular craft nights, figure drawing, and even queer bachata lessons. Their monthly \u201cDyke Night\u201d dance parties attract upwards of 100 people. For one of the bar\u2019s very first Dyke Nights last year, there was a line out the door. \u201cIt was a sense of, not only is this wanted, but it\u2019s been wanted for a while,\u201d Karcher said. Despite mounting political efforts to restrict gay rights in states like North Carolina, Texas and Tennessee, many cities in the South have a robust LGBTQ scene. These bars are more than just spots to grab a drink. They\u2019re community fixtures and emblems of LGBTQ history. Lesbian bars are places of belonging and resistance Nightlife has always been a tenet of LGBTQ culture. For most of US history, being gay was a criminal offense, one that could lead not only to social ostracization but jail time. Being seen out in public, socializing with visibly queer people, was shrouded in shame. The only place to be out and safe was in bars and parties, where the cover of night, close quarters and plausible deniability \u2014 a bar, after all, is a place for petty sin \u2014 provided shelter. In the 19th century, women socialized (and slept) with other women at private parties and gatherings. LGBTQ bars began to appear in cities like Chicago and San Francisco in the 1920s and 1930s, but most lesbians never went to them, according to lesbian history expert Lillian Faderman in her book \u201cOdd Girls and Twilight Lovers.\u201d Instead, they would attend private parties, like the weekly gatherings organized for lesbians and gay men by New York\u2019s Nucleus Club. As they left, each man would pair with a woman, so neighbors would be none the wiser. Today, these bars offer an alternative to the straight mating rituals of common watering holes, where groups of women and men circle the room like predator and prey. Even in these rarified places, there\u2019s still variety: Some are cocktail-forward spaces that close at a respectable hour, others are dance clubs that don\u2019t let up until 3 in the morning. No matter the vibe, all exist, in some capacity, as a space for LGBTQ people to be themselves. Most American lesbian bars exist in large cities. In the South, The Lipstick Lounge, Tennessee\u2019s only bar registered with the Lesbian Bar Project, is in Nashville\u2019s hip East End neighborhood. My Sister\u2019s Room, the only known lesbian bar in Georgia, sits right in the middle of Atlanta alongside sky-scraping office buildings and modern apartments. Houston\u2019s Pearl Bar is nestled among a frenzied bar scene on Washington Ave. Although Arcana is the only known lesbian bar in Durham, there are a handful of other gay and LGBTQ bars in the city, hosting everything from queer dance parties to fundraisers for sexual violence survivors. These events can be packed. Nights out here attract dozens of locals and students from neighboring colleges. Depending on the evening, you\u2019re as likely to see Carhartt work pants as you are leather corsets. Though Karcher has lived in North Carolina for most of her life, she spent time in New York and has visited LGBTQ bars in other cities, like Seattle. In more liberal cities, there\u2019s a sense that the state\u2019s politics support you, she said, that even outside the bar is safe. Even in Durham, a city that has become \u201cso queer\u201d in an otherwise red-leaning state, Karcher said going to a LGBTQ bar carries an air of defiance. \u201cWe\u2019re never as confident about our state politics here,\u201d she said, referencing controversies over Confederate monuments, efforts against diversity in higher education, and past struggles against discriminatory laws like HB2, commonly known as \u201cthe bathroom bill.\u201d There\u2019s always something to fight against, either nationally or locally, she continued. But to look around and know you\u2019re fighting alongside community, alongside family, is empowering. \u201cWe\u2019re working together,\u201d she said. When queer culture meets Southern hospitality Over the course of nine months, writer Krista Burton visited 20 lesbian bars around the country, going to each one multiple times and immersing herself in their scenes. She chronicled her findings in her book \u201cMoby Dyke: An Obsessive Quest to Track Down the Last Remaining Lesbian Bars in America.\u201d As she traversed through the South, she noted a fascinating ambient shift. At every bar she went to in the region, she was immediately noticed and greeted \u2014 a different experience from lesbian bars in other parts of the country, and one she hadn\u2019t expected. Strangers would readily talk to her. The vibe was relaxed. It felt like they were all a part of a secret club \u2014 an oasis in a part of the country that isn\u2019t always overtly welcoming to LGBTQ people. \u201cTo step inside those doors was to experience a new kind of welcome that I had not experienced before,\u201d Burton said. \u201cLike members of the community, seeing me and being happy that I was (there).\u201d Call it queer Southern hospitality. At Herz, in Mobile, Alabama, every single person turned around to greet Burton upon her entrance, a \u201cfreaky\u201d experience unlike anything she\u2019d ever encountered. By the time she left, she had met every person in the bar \u2014 about 50 people. At Yellow Brick Road, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, bartenders eagerly introduced her to regulars to chat with. Five hours down south, at Sue Ellen\u2019s in Dallas \u2014 a packed bar brimming with hundreds of people \u2014 a bartender she met upon first entering yelled goodbye when Burton left, hours later, and still remembered her name. By the end of Burton\u2019s trip, she found that the narrative of \u201cdying lesbian bars\u201d was maybe not totally accurate. Lesbian bar culture\u2019s evolution reflects changing demographics More people, especially those in younger generations, are identifying as LGBTQ, according to Gallup, with 3% of Gen Z adults considering themselves lesbian. On the other hand, many young people are increasingly identifying not simply as \u201cgay\u201d or \u201clesbian,\u201d but \u201cqueer\u201d or \u201cpansexual\u201d \u2014 shifting labels that evade binary classifications. Sexuality and gender identity can be fluid. Though nearly a quarter of Gen Z adults consider themselves part of the broader LGBTQ umbrella, not everyone may see themselves solely as \u201clesbian,\u201d and thus may prefer gathering in a more generalized LGBTQ space. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a physical shift from a lesbian bar to a bar that sometimes holds \u2026 queer or lesbian nights,\u201d Burton said. \u201cThe need for bars is there. The customer base is there. It\u2019s just that the bars shift in how they look.\u201d That\u2019s what has happened at Harlym Blue\u2019Z, a bar in Richmond, Virginia owned by wife-duo Shamecca and Le\u2019Teshia LeSane. Though they don\u2019t consider Harlym a lesbian bar per se \u2014 their clientele is wide-ranging \u2014 there are rainbow stickers scattered throughout the space, and they\u2019ve partnered with local Black LGBTQ organizations to host weekly events in the past. When customers realize the two are married, some of them have questions \u2014 sometimes about managing a business with a spouse, sometimes about being young Black business owners, and sometimes, of course, about their sexualities. For some customers, the LeSanes are the first lesbian couple they\u2019ve ever interacted with. One group, who\u2019ve become regulars after previously not knowing any LGBTQ couples, even invited the two on a week-long family cruise. \u201cBeing able to educate people, not saying \u2018Hey this is what you have to do, but this is who we are,\u2019\u201d Le\u2019Teshia said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re enjoying it, you\u2019re enjoying this dance, if you\u2019re enjoying this place, then this is who we are and this is what it\u2019s about.\u201d Lesbian bars fight to keep tradition alive As LGBTQ bars became more popular, these watering holes were still subject to police raids and other violent upheavals in the late 20th century. Notably, the watershed 1969 Stonewall riots, which inspired our modern Pride parades, began as a police raid on the Stonewall Inn, a known gay bar. These days, for most people, the sense that a bar would be the only safe space has lessened, which could be one reason behind the seemingly fading culture of lesbian-specific bars. Still, there are more general challenges facing these spaces. Like any bar or restaurant, they can be hard to keep open. Herz, in Mobile, closed last year after four years in business, the owners announced in a Facebook post. Dozens mourned the bar\u2019s closing in the comments section, grieving the karaoke nights and the \u201csafe haven\u201d the bar provided. \u201cIt\u2019s a really big loss for the Mobile community and the Gulf Coast. I mean, people from Florida and Mississippi were coming to Herz,\u201d customer Kimberly McKeand told CBS42. \u201cWe were all devastated by its closing, I mean, many of us cried over it because it was just a safe place for us, a very comfortable place.\u201d In Virginia, too, Le\u2019Teshia said many of the longstanding LGBTQ bars have closed both in Richmond and in the neighboring cities. The popular Club Colours, a LGBTQ pop-up bar on Saturday nights, shut down after nearly a decade. Though other LGBTQ bars in the area still exist, Le\u2019Teshia said Club Colours was one of the only LGBTQ spaces in the area that served a truly diverse clientele. \u201cI really don\u2019t feel that the scene is what it used to be,\u201d she said. \u201cNow you\u2019ll see just more groups of people going to regular clubs, regular bars.\u201d In bigger cities where places may be more LGBTQ-friendly, there\u2019s an idea that lesbian-specific bars may be a relic, particularly when general bars and clubs could provide the same experience. But Christa Suppan, who has owned Nashville\u2019s The Lipstick Lounge for more than two decades, believes the culture will live on. \u201cI will always believe that at the heart of any bar resides a common language, whatever that may be,\u201d Suppan said. \u201cWhen you see your people, you know. I think it\u2019s much easier to build community within a space of like-minded individuals.\u201d For any lesbian bar, creating that common space is the goal. And especially in the South, it means the community they build isn\u2019t just valued, it\u2019s essential, even if you have to search to find it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/us/lesbian-bars-south-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_us_police-investigation-shooting-saturday-michigan-nine-injured", "text": "Nine people were injured in an apparent \u201crandom\u201d shooting at a Michigan recreation center on Saturday, and police are still searching for a motive. Law enforcement recovered 11 guns from the home of the man authorities say opened fire at the Brooklands Plaza Splash Pad in Rochester Hills, Michigan, but a clear motive continues to allude investigators days later, Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said in an update Monday. \u201cSo far, we\u2019ve not been able to uncover any written paper manifesto types of things,\u201d Bouchard said. The sheriff said the gunman, identified as Michael William Nash, 42, from Shelby Township, had two handguns at the scene and left one behind. Forensics teams also recovered 36 casings\u00a0at the splash pad, the sheriff said. Investigators have not yet confirmed if he legally owned all the weapons. The shooter pulled up to the splash pad, exited a vehicle and opened fire from roughly 20 feet away, reloading multiple times, Bouchard said Saturday. The shooting took place during a particularly violent weekend in America, with more than 14 mass shootings, including a shooting at a Juneteenth celebration in Texas that left two dead and more than 14 others injured, and a shooting at a car meetup in Massachusetts, where seven people were shot. The weekend incidents are among more than 200 mass shootings in the US this year, according to the\u00a0Gun Violence Archive. The archive, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter. Nash, the suspect in the Michigan shooting, was found dead with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound at the home he shared with his mother after police tracked the weapon from the shooting to an address around half a mile from the crime scene, Bouchard said. Police have not been able to communicate more with the gunman\u2019s mother, who was out of state and has retained legal counsel, the sheriff said Monday. Nash didn\u2019t have any previous police contact or criminal record, according to Bouchard. To help with the investigation, law enforcement seized various electronics including a phone, computers and thumb drives, he said Monday. The victims, including two small children and their mother, were injured in the shooting and taken to four local hospitals with \u201cvarying kinds of injuries,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cWhen I got on scene, I started to cry,\u201d said Rochester Hills Mayor Bryan Barnett on Saturday night. \u201cBecause I know what a splash pad is supposed to be. It\u2019s supposed to be a place where people gather, where families make memories, where people have fun and enjoy a Saturday afternoon and it wasn\u2019t today.\u201d \u201cUnder no circumstances is it normal for ice cream cones and flip flops to be strewn amongst blood and bullet casings,\u201d said Michigan Rep. John James at a news conference Saturday night. As of Monday afternoon, Bouchard said\u00a0two victims remain in critical condition, but a 37-year-old woman and a 77-year-old man have been released from the hospital. An 8-year-old boy suffered a gunshot wound to the head and his 4-year-old brother was shot in the thigh and is stable, Bouchard said over the weekend. Their 39-year-old mother, with wounds to the abdomen and leg, was also in critical condition. \u201cThe young child that had the head wound, he\u2019s made amazing progress,\u201d the sheriff said Monday. The incident appears to be \u201crandom\u201d as the suspect has \u201cno connectivity to the victims,\u201d the sheriff said. Authorities are looking into a possible motive but have yet to determine one, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s our understanding that apparently he was undergoing some mental health challenges,\u201d\u00a0Bouchard said during a news conference Saturday. He\u00a0did not offer additional details. The shooting comes as Michigan communities are still recovering from two mass shootings in the state in recent years. In February 2023, a gunman killed\u00a0three Michigan State University\u00a0students and\u00a0critically wounded\u00a0five others. And in 2021, a teenager killed four students at a high school in Oxford. \u201cWe\u2019re not even fully comprehending what happened at Oxford, and now we have another complete tragedy that we\u2019re dealing with,\u201d Bouchard said. How the shooting unfolded at a crowded splash pad Bouchard said the gunman arrived at the splash pad and opened fire with a Glock 9 mm handgun. \u201cIt looked chaotic. You could see people kind of just enjoying the day and then it was a scramble,\u201d Bouchard said, referencing video of the shooting. \u201cPeople were falling, getting hit, trying to run.\u201d \u201cHe started firing once he was out of his car from the base of the steps, climbing the steps, reloading and then was firing from the top of the steps in the splash pad area before he left and appeared to leave in no rush, just calmly walked back to his car,\u201d Bouchard said. One witness said she first thought there were fireworks going off. \u201cWe were sitting out on the patio and we heard what we thought was firecrackers and I guess it was gunshots because we heard people screaming, like \u2018help us, help us!\u2019\u201d Cheryl Delcotto told CNN. \u201cSo, we ran around, I called 911, I couldn\u2019t get a hold of anybody because I guess people were already calling.\u201d The first 911 call alerting police to the incident was made around 5:11 p.m. Bouchard said a Rochester Hills sergeant responded to the scene within two minutes \u2013 before the call was dispatched. By that point, the suspect had already fled the scene, according to Bouchard. Authorities located the handgun and three empty magazines at the scene, the sheriff said. Delcotto, who was visiting a home near the splash pad when the shooting began, described seeing blood-covered victims and people rendering aid. \u201cI see people laying on the ground, I seen a guy who was shot in the stomach who was sitting on a chair, an older man,\u201d she said. Then she saw a man whose \u201cson was coming out on a stretcher \u2013 with blood all over his face, and it was scary.\u201d Suspect found dead after police breached his home After the shooting, police traced the weapon found at the scene to a nearby home, where they found a vehicle matching a description of the one that drove away from the scene of the shooting, according to the sheriff. The suspect was not known to authorities until they did a \u201cquick investigation\u201d and determined who they believed was involved based on evidence from the scene of the shooting. Police had containment on the home within 45 minutes to one hour, according to Bouchard. There was \u201can\u00a0acknowledgment\u00a0that\u00a0we\u00a0were\u00a0there\u00a0and\u00a0we\u00a0heard\u00a0or\u00a0saw\u00a0him,\u201d Bouchard said. After making attempts to contact the suspect, law enforcement \u201cbreached the home and deployed drones to begin an examination of the home,\u201d and located the deceased suspect,\u00a0Bouchard\u00a0said. Police later found a handgun next to the deceased suspect inside the home. A drone that flew into the home while police surrounded it also found what appeared to be an \u201cAR-platform\u201d firearm on the kitchen table, Bouchard said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me \u2013 because having that on the kitchen table is not an everyday activity \u2013 that there was probably something else, a second chapter, potentially,\u201d Bouchard\u00a0said. Police said the investigation is ongoing as they work to \u201cdetermine if there\u2019s either a digital or a paper trail that would give us some insight\u201d and piece together a timeline of how the shooting unfolded. Whether or not the suspect posted any relevant information on social media or has anything on his devices will also be part of the investigation, officials said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be one of those challenges to try to figure out why there appears to be no connection between the victims and the location whatsoever. A person doesn\u2019t live in Rochester Hills. He went to a Rochester Hills Park,\u201d Bouchard said. Authorities have also recovered video evidence from a nearby camera and are looking for bullet fragments, Bouchard said. Suspect\u2019s former bankruptcy attorney remembers him as \u2018soft-spoken\u2019 As the investigation continues and new details emerge about the suspect, an attorney who represented Nash in a 2011 bankruptcy case remembered him as a \u201csoft-spoken\u201d individual who suffered in the financial crash of 2007 to 2009. \u201cI remember Michael because he was very young to be needing bankruptcy. He was yet another person who fell victim to the aftereffects of the 2009 financial crisis,\u201d Kelli Meeks told CNN. Although Meeks is a licensed attorney, according to the state bar of Michigan, she told CNN she stopped practicing law in 2021 to become a consultant and leadership coach. Nash was trying to run his own landscaping business, but after the financial crash, Meeks says it did not work out. She told CNN Nash was about $21,000 in debt and had his car and landscaping equipment repossessed. \u201cAnd on top of that, he had medical bills to take care of,\u201d Meeks said. \u201cHe was a young man down on his luck.\u201d Community was still reeling from Oxford shooting Saturday\u2019s incident was a \u201cgut punch\u201d to a community still reeling from a 2021 shooting at Oxford High School, just 15 miles north of Rochester Hills, Bouchard said. \u201cNone of us in this room, in this community or in this country, anticipated going into Father\u2019s Day weekend with this kind of tragedy \u2013 that families will be deeply affected by forever,\u201d the sheriff said Saturday. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said\u00a0in a statement on X\u00a0she is in contact with local officials following the shooting. \u201cI am heartbroken to learn about the shooting in Rochester Hills,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe are monitoring the situation as updates continue to come in, and are in touch with local officials.\u201d President Joe Biden and White House officials are also tracking the shooting, White House spokesperson Jeremy Edwards said.

{"id": "2024_06_17_business_boeing-ceo-calhoun-testimony", "text": "Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun plans to apologize for Boeing\u2019s recent safety failures in Senate testimony Tuesday and admit to problems with the company culture, but he\u2019ll push back on whistleblower claims that the company retaliated against those who brought safety issues to light. \u201cMuch has been said about Boeing\u2019s culture. We\u2019ve heard those concerns loud and clear,\u201d he will say in prepared remarks released by Boeing Monday afternoon. \u201cOur culture is far from perfect, but we are taking action and making progress. We understand the gravity, and we are committed to moving forward.\u201d The \u201cfar from perfect\u201d remark is a massive understatement. Boeing has been under intense scrutiny with numerous federal investigations and congressional hearings since a January 5 Alaska Air Boeing 737 Max flight had a door plug blow off, leaving a gaping hole in both the plane and Boeing\u2019s reputation. Boeing has been ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration to improve its safety issues before it can resume normal production, causing problems for airlines that can\u2019t get the planes they ordered. And that, in turn, has meant higher fares for passengers, who have had their faith the company\u2019s planes sorely tested. The hearing Tuesday by the Senate\u2019s permanent subcommittee on investigations is entitled \u201cBoeing\u2019s broken safety culture.\u201d It is just the latest congressional hearing this year about safety issues at Boeing but the first time Calhoun is testifying in his more than four years running the troubled company. He will be joined by Howard McKenzie, Boeing\u2019s chief engineer. At an April 17 hearing Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour testified that Boeing is putting out defective planes because he and others who complain faced pressure not to do so. \u201cI have serious concerns about the safety of the 787 and 777 aircraft, and I\u2019m willing to take on professional risk to talk about them,\u201d Salehpour said in his opening statement. He said when he raised concerns, \u201cI was ignored. I was told not to create delays. I was told, frankly, to shut up.\u201d Calhoun denies that is the case currently at Boeing in his prepared remarks. \u201cWe are committed to making sure every employee feels empowered to speak up if there is a problem,\u201d he\u2019ll say, according to the prepared remarks. \u201cWe also have strict policies in place to prohibit retaliation against employees who come forward. It is our job to listen, regardless of how we obtain feedback, and handle it with the seriousness it deserves.\u201d Will there be changes? Despite the attention the hearing is expected to garner, it\u2019s unlikely to produce significant change at the company, said Richard Aboulafia, managing partner for AeroDynamic Consultancy, an aerospace advisory firm. \u201cNothing has produced change (at Boeing) except frustration from a bunch of airline customers,\u201d said Aboulafia. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what will change as a consequence of this. He (Calhoun) needs to go. He has shown a strong desire to double down on what\u2019s bad.\u201d A preliminary investigation of the Alaska Air incident has found that the plane left a Boeing factory two months before the incident without the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place. And Boeing has yet to produce the paperwork to identify who in the factory installed the door plug without the bolts. It has been harshly criticized by members of Congress and safety regulators and will likely face more criticism Tuesday. Calhoun has already met with members of Congress since the Alaska Air incident, albeit behind closed doors. He has also made numerous public statements to Boeing employees and to investors since the Alaska Air incident. \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that,\u201d he told investors in January during a call after reporting its fifth straight annual loss. \u201cWhatever conclusions (from the investigations) are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better.\u201d Apologies to families, passengers Calhoun\u2019s prepared remarks begin with an apology to the family members of the victims of two fatal 737 Max crashes. Some of those family members plan to attend the hearing. Between them, 346 people were killed in the 2018 and 2019 crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, leading to to a 20-month grounding of the jet to fix a design flaw that caused the crashes. \u201cWe are deeply sorry for your losses,\u201d he\u2019ll say in his opening comments. \u201cNothing is more important than the safety of the people who step on board our airplanes. Every day we seek to honor the memory of those lost.\u201d He also plans to again apologize to the passengers and crew of the Alaska Air flight in January. \u201cWe deeply regret the impact that the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 accident had on Alaska Airlines\u2019 team and its passengers, and we are grateful to the pilots and crew for safely landing the plane,\u201d he\u2019ll say. \u201cWe are thankful that there were no fatalities.\u201d But experts say that it was sheer luck that no one was killed in the Alaska Air incident. This could very well be Calhoun\u2019s only time testifying on Capitol Hill. He has announced plans to retire before the end of this year. His successor has yet to be selected. Beyond Tuesday\u2019s hearing, and the numerous federal investigations it faces, the company could still face criminal liability from the original certification process of the 737 Max. In January of 2021 Boeing agreed to a probationary period, which deferred any prosecution on those charges and which would have exempted it from criminal liability in the crashes. But the January 5 incident aboard the Alaska Air flight happened just days before the end of the probationary period. In May the Justice Department notified Boeing that it was now subject to criminal prosecution. Boeing has denied the Alaska Air incident violated the deferred prosecution agreement and is challenging any potential criminal liability in court. The family members planning to attend Tuesday\u2019s hearing say they want to see Boeing prosecuted criminally.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/business/boeing-ceo-calhoun-testimony/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "us"}}

The agency also expressed concern about lax response by the City University of New York to at least three allegations of harassment \u201cbased on national origin\u201d since the Israel-Hamas war began last year. In its report on the University of Michigan, the agency\u2019s Office of Civil Rights said, \u201cthe University appears not to have taken steps to assess whether incidents about which it had notice individually or cumulatively created a hostile environment for students, faculty, or staff, and, if so, to take steps reasonably calculated to end the hostile environment, remedy its effects, and prevent its recurrence.\u201d The federal agency reviewed 67 complaints \u2013 many of which predated the Israel-Hamas conflict \u2013 and found \u201cthe University only investigated and made findings in a single complaint.\u201d One complaint involved a protest on campus in October 2023 where people were chanting \u201cNazi liberation.\u201d The federal report says the university\u2019s civil rights office simply \u201cforwarded the reports to public affairs for response.\u201d A complaint from January 2023 described \u201cpeople participating in a parade on campus while allegedly chanting for the removal and death of the Jewish people and the state of Israel.\u201d The Department of Education report found no evidence the university had taken any action. Instead, it said \u201cthe matter, as reported, appears to be outside the scope of ECRT,\u201d the university\u2019s office which handles civil rights complaints regarding faculty and staff. The office called the chanting \u201cprotected activity.\u201d One student who participated in a pro-Palestinian protest last year reported a person \u201cyelled at the student that she was supporting rape and murder, and that she has terrorist friends.\u201d The case was closed after the school \u201cheld restorative circles for staff, faculty, and students.\u201d A 2016 diversity study by the University of Michigan found 8% of students and 10% of faculty were Jewish.

In a voluntary agreement, the University of Michigan committed to investigating complaints more thoroughly, acknowledging it \u201cmust assess whether each reported incident has created a hostile environment.\u201d It will also \u201cdevelop a comprehensive annual training program on discrimination and harassment.\u201d In a statement Monday, the University of Michigan said, \u201cThis agreement reflects the university\u2019s commitment to ensuring it has the tools needed to determine whether an individual\u2019s acts or speech creates a hostile environment, and taking the affirmative measures necessary to provide a safe and supportive educational environment for all.\u201d In a second resolution announced Monday, the Department of Education announced a similar agreement was reached with the City University of New York in response to multiple complaints of discrimination against both Jewish and Palestinian students \u201con the basis of their actual or perceived national origin/shared ancestry,\u201d with some pre-dating October 2023. The report specifically notes three cases of harassment relating to \u201cshared Palestinian, Arab, and/or Muslim ancestry and association with these national origins/shared ancestries,\u201d since October 2023.

{"id": "2024_06_17_politics_steve-bannon-danbury-prison-contempt-of-congress", "text": "When\u00a0former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon\u00a0goes to prison, he won\u2019t be serving time at what\u2019s known as a \u201cClub Fed,\u201d the most comfortable type of facility in the federal system, as he had wanted,\u00a0according to people familiar with the arrangements. Instead of a minimum-security prison camp, where\u00a0many nonviolent offenders\u00a0serve their time,\u00a0Bannon \u2013 now a right-wing podcaster with a following of loyal Trump supporters \u2013 is set to report\u00a0next month\u00a0to the low-security federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, one of the sources told CNN. A federal judge ruled recently\u00a0that\u00a0Bannon must turn himself in by July 1\u00a0to begin serving\u00a0a four-month\u00a0sentence\u00a0for contempt of Congress even as he appeals the case. His attorneys initially thought he may be able to do his time at a camp, the sources said. But\u00a0Bannon isn\u2019t eligible for the lowest-level prison setup because he still has a pending criminal case against him in New York,\u00a0where he is fighting the charges and set to go to trial in September. That case accuses him of defrauding donors in a fundraising effort branded the \u201cWe Build the Wall\u201d\u00a0campaign for a border wall\u00a0between the US and Mexico. Bannon was convicted by a federal jury two years ago in Washington, DC, for not complying with\u00a0a\u00a0subpoena\u00a0for an\u00a0interview and documents in the US House\u2019s January 6, 2021, investigation. He has remained a staunch Trump ally and has been a vocal supporter of his presidential reelection bid. Bannon\u2019s lawyers have\u00a0written to the DC US Circuit Court of Appeals that his imprisonment shouldn\u2019t happen this summer, as the trial-level judge has ordered, because he would be behind bars \u201cfor the four-month period leading up to the November election, when millions of Americans look to him for information on important campaign issues,\u201d according to a recent filing for Bannon. \u201cThis would also effectively bar Mr. Bannon from serving as a meaningful advisor in the ongoing national campaign,\u201d Bannon\u2019s lawyers wrote. The\u00a0Federal\u00a0Bureau of Prisons declined to comment, saying it could not release specific information on prisoners until after they\u2019re in custody, for security and privacy reasons. The prison in Connecticut where Bannon will live houses a large number of white-collar criminals, but it also\u00a0may house\u00a0violent\u00a0and sex\u00a0offenders in its men\u2019s population. It doesn\u2019t have cells, and instead houses its inmates in open pods. Yet it does have a noticeable barrier\u00a0\u2014\u00a0referred to colloquially as \u201cthe wall\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0between\u00a0the prison\u00a0facility\u00a0and the outside world, which prison camps don\u2019t have. More than 1,000 male prisoners are in the Danbury facility. Its\u00a0much smaller\u00a0adjacent prison camp for women was immortalized in\u00a0a former\u00a0prisoner\u2019s memoir that inspired the TV show \u201cOrange is the New Black.\u201d Some of Bannon\u2019s defense attorneys, when contacted by CNN on Monday, weren\u2019t aware of the plans or available, and Bannon hasn\u2019t commented directly. Rikers Island possibility Bannon could\u00a0still\u00a0potentially\u00a0face rougher prison environments. He may need to be held in a facility in New York City, such as the infamous Rikers Island jail, during his state trial proceedings if it takes place while he is still serving his federal sentence, one of the sources said. His time in\u00a0federal\u00a0prison is likely to run through October if no appeals court intervenes, the person said. Bannon\u00a0and Peter Navarro\u00a0\u2013\u00a0another Trump adviser who was sent to prison for contempt of Congress in the\u00a0January 6 investigation \u2013\u00a0are not able to be released earlier than their four-month terms in prison, as some first-time offenders can be, because their sentences don\u2019t include time under supervised release, people familiar with\u00a0their\u00a0situations tell CNN. Navarro is set to be released on July 17.\u00a0This means both Navarro and Bannon will be behind bars during the Republican National Convention in mid-July. Both men retained prison consultant Sam Mangel to help them have the best setup on the inside. Bannon is awaiting word from the DC Circuit\u00a0this week\u00a0on whether a panel of three judges would be willing to keep him out of prison for the moment.\u00a0He has already lost one round of appeals, but his lawyers say he intends to go to the Supreme Court. Bannon and Trump Bannon still maintains close connections\u00a0to Trump and his\u00a0political world\u200b. Bannon\u00a0spoke at a conservative gathering in Detroit this weekend where Trump also spoke. Bannon vowed\u00a0that Trump\u2019s political opponents and federal law enforcement authorities\u00a0would face blowback\u00a0if Trump wins a second term as president. \u201cYou are going to be investigated, prosecuted and incarcerated,\u201d Bannon said. And Boris Epshteyn, one of the most influential legal advisers around Trump currently,\u00a0has\u00a0been part of Bannon\u2019s legal defense strategy, according to multiple sources familiar with the\u00a0matter. On Monday,\u00a0Bannon said\u00a0the former\u00a0president\u00a0was calling him during\u00a0his podcast. Bannon\u00a0answered the phone and said\u00a0he would call\u00a0Trump\u00a0back.

{"id": "2024_04_11_us_creating-catan-board-games-card-cec", "text": "When Guido and Benjamin Teuber were young, their father would sit them down at a table in their small family home in Hessia, Germany on Sundays \u2014 the only day he wasn\u2019t working 12 hours as a master dental technician \u2014 to play board games. It was more than fun between father and sons: Klaus Teuber, who passed away last year, became a renowned board game creator. In 1995, Klaus Teuber released Catan (then called The Settlers of Catan) in Germany. The game would go on to become one of the most popular in the world. The brothers recall a day around 10 years ago when they tested out an early version of a Catan expansion with their parents. It was so unplayable that their mother left the table to go do the laundry. Such visions of family and friends huddled around a board game are universal. Everyone has their version \u2014 maybe it involves Parcheesi, or one of the hundreds of versions of Monopoly, or a raucous round of Cards Against Humanity at a party. With 19% of people worldwide playing board games as a hobby and the global board game market reaching almost $17 billion in 2023, it\u2019s an industry that\u2019s hard to ignore. Big box retailers and bookstores have shelves dedicated to games, and you can even find board game cafes in cities around the world. Tabletop games, such as Risk and Clue, are the most popular segment of board games, closely followed by card and dice games like Uno and Pandemic: The Cure. Tabletop games also encompass role-playing games like the iconic Dungeons & Dragons. Whether you\u2019re a dedicated hobby player or a casual board gamer, have you ever stopped to wonder what, exactly, it takes to create one of the beautiful board games you see everywhere? For National Board Game Day on April 11, CNN spoke with designers, artists, marketers and publishers of some of the most popular board games in the world to understand what it takes to build a game from scratch. Building the story of a board game Like a board game itself, developing a game requires both creativity and strategy at every stage \u2014 from ideation to playtesting to picking out the components, finding vendors and shipping the game. Patience, according to Benjamin Teuber, is key. After working with their father at the company for many years, Benjamin and his brother Guido\u00a0now run Catan GmbH, as the managing director and CEO, respectively. Since its release in 1995, the strategy game about collecting resources such as lumber, ore and grain, and using them to build empires has spawned numerous expansions and alternate versions. Tiles of the various resources form the game board, along with resource cards and models of roads, towns and cities in each player\u2019s color. To date, Catan has sold over 45 million copies worldwide. For Benjamin Teuber, who worked closely on the development of games with his father Klaus for over 10 years, the first step is writing down ideas for a new game. Then he takes about a month to think about these ideas, the story he wants to tell, and what some of the mechanics could be. \u201cThe story is always the core,\u201d says Benjamin Teuber. \u201cIf the story is well reflected in the mechanics, that is the point when you start making notes, then off the notes maybe some sketches on the computer in a graphic program.\u201d From there, he prints the first prototype on paper to play the game himself. Bringing the story to life The development process for Wyrmspan, which was released on March 29 by Stonemaier Games, was slightly different to that of CATAN. Wyrmspan is a spinoff of the award-winning Wingspan (also by Stonemaier), but instead of enticing birds to habitats on your board (with each bird represented on individual cards), you\u2019re building caves with various types of dragons. A dragon variation was one of the most requested spinoffs of the original, says Connie Vogelmann, Wyrmspan\u2019s designer. When Jamey Stegmaier, a co-founder of Stonemaier, approached Vogelmann to design the game in early 2022, the first step was to get approval from Wingspan designer Elizabeth Hargrave, who signed on as a developer for Wyrmspan. Because Vogelmann had a pre-existing game system, the development process for Wyrmspan was a bit faster than average. \u201cIt took about a year, or 15 months, to get the core of the game locked in,\u201d says Vogelmann. For context, the idea for Catan: New Energies, which is set to release in May, was in development around 10 years ago before getting shelved. During the pandemic, they revisited the idea and have been working on it since. The biggest design challenge, Vogelmann says, was paying homage to Wingspan while making Wyrmspan unique. \u201cIn some ways it was easier, because it provided some constraints for the game, but in some ways it was much, much harder.\u201d Vogelmann and Hargrave went through many iterations for Wyrmspan \u2014 for a while it was actually a bag-building game, where players\u2019 actions are affected by tokens added to or removed from a bag. Then, \u201cmid to late in the process,\u201d Vogelmann says they imported the Wingspan player mats into Wyrmspan, which is when the game clicked. \u201cThat was kind of the missing secret sauce.\u201d Playing, testing and playing again Once the designer has an initial prototype for a board game, they usually go straight into playtesting mode. For Jane Hoffacker, CEO of game studio Incredible Dream, this also includes printing the game on paper. Prior to co-founding Incredible Dream in 2020, Hoffacker worked in production and video games. They started at Activision with Guitar Hero before moving on to Riot Games, where they became an executive producer for the Emmy award-winning Netflix animated series \u201cArcane,\u201d based on League of Legends. \u201cI came in (to board games) with much more of a video game mindset,\u201d says Hoffacker. \u201cWhich was like, \u2018we need to go through 1,000 steps to get to whatever.\u2019\u201d They quickly realized this was not the case. \u201cI could literally print it out on my printer and take it to a local game cafe and sit down with strangers who were very willing to just test with me in person,\u201d Hoffacker says. These paper prototypes are used to test the game before the specific mechanics are set. Aside from game cafes, Hoffacker and the Incredible Dream team also take prototypes to game conventions where \u201cthere\u2019s lines of people waiting to play a paper prototype.\u201d These playtesting sessions, where people will play through a prototype of a game to give their feedback, will often result in a series of adjustments \u2014 or, in some cases, scrapping a game completely and going back to the ideation and development phase. Vogelmann, the designer of Wyrmspan, says she\u2019s very much a mechanism-first designer but that playtesting is really where a game\u2019s mechanics become clear. \u201cI tend to iterate and prototype very, very, very quickly,\u201d Vogelmann says. Her philosophy is to print it out and get it onto a paper page as soon as possible \u2014 no matter how ugly the prototype is. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to envision how things are gonna play out \u2014 they play out one way in your head, they were perfect in your head, then you get to the table and it falls apart.\u201d From there, it\u2019s clear what works and what doesn\u2019t, and Vogelmann can try again. For Benjamin Teuber, the iteration process for Catan looks very similar, although the playtesting is quite different from most board game studios. When doing the first playtest with another person, he says it \u201cnormally completely fails.\u201d After this, he already knows whether it makes sense to continue developing or not. \u201cIn some cases, you will also have to say at some point, it just didn\u2019t work. It doesn\u2019t draw the people to the table \u2014 and you have to let it go.\u201d Making the game a physical reality Game development doesn\u2019t end once the mechanics and design are set. From there, developers work to get a finished game into the hands of players. This includes everything from finalizing the art and finding vendors to manufacture the game\u2019s parts, to deciding on what physical elements can be included \u2014 and in what form \u2014\u00a0based on the target demographic and price point. \u201cWe spent a lot of time trying to get the components right,\u201d Hoffacker says. Often, this has included working with a publisher (like Stonemaier) to finalize the elements and try to keep costs down through existing relationships. Increasingly, indie board game studios are using crowdfunding platforms to launch their games \u2014 offering stretch goals to upgrade certain elements to a premium look or feel. It\u2019s not just about the art \u2014 it\u2019s also about something as simple as font size, or how each element feels in someone\u2019s hand. For Incredible Dream\u2019s upcoming title A Gentle Rain, which it describes as a \u201ccozy tile placement game,\u201d each tile has a soft velvet feeling, with UV spot treatments on the back that look like a drop of water. \u201cWhen you touch it, you can actually feel all the ripples and it kind of feels nice as you\u2019re placing the tiles down,\u201d says Hoffacker. \u201cThen you\u2019re also supposed to place these tokens which are made out of wood, so it kind of mixes up the tactile feel between components.\u201d Another version of the game is being produced specifically for the mass consumer market, with 3D-sculpted plastic flowers instead of the wooden tokens. This version will be sent to big box stores such as Target, says Hoffacker. The quick turn for Wyrmspan was, in part, due to having Clementine Campardou, an artist from France, work at the same time as the development for the game \u2014 a process that usually happens after the core mechanics are locked in. Campardou hand-painted everything for Wyrmspan in watercolor, from the game\u2019s box to the backgrounds of the boards and the cards themselves \u2014\u00a075 unique cave cards and 183 unique dragons. This in itself was a challenge, with the team having to be pragmatic. \u201cWhen doing 200 of anything, if each takes 1 day or 5 days, that\u2019s the difference between a 2024 or a 2026 release date,\u201d Campardou told CNN via email. The entire process took Campardou a year and a half, with the first few months spent researching dragons, nature and weird animals. \u201cEven though I took no part in the game design itself, I had to understand how the pieces all fit together,\u201d Campardou says. \u201cFor the dragons, Connie and I worked closely so the classification would somehow match the designs, whether their dominant colour, their size, their family.\u201d One thing that many players don\u2019t think about, says Benjamin Teuber, is the actual cost of each individual element. \u201cYou have the final price of a game, which is so much higher than people think,\u201d he says. \u201cThis little token, or this dice, would make the game 50 cents more expensive \u2026 we always have to try to find the balance between nice and appealing material which is still affordable.\u201d If the game is for a mass consumer market, developers have to be a lot more conscious of the price. These players are often just looking for a fun diversion, says Kelli Schmitz, Director of Brand Development at Catan Studio, who works on Catan\u2019s marketing strategy for the English-speaking world. \u201cYour hobby gamer is a lot less price sensitive,\u201d she says. They understand that the cost isn\u2019t just about the physical components themselves, but also the expertise of the developers and the time it took to create the game. Once the vendors are picked, the parts manufactured, and the boxes compiled, the shipping of the games globally can take anywhere from six to eight months, depending on where the vendors are and the freight company that is chosen. The first print run of Catan in the US was 5,000 units out of a garage in Skokie, Illinois, near the airport, says Guido Teuber. Reflecting on Klaus Teuber\u2019s process for game design and development, Guido Teuber says that his dad always believed in having beautiful prototypes. \u201cHe invested so much time and money into creating these amazing prototypes,\u201d he says. \u201cWe gave our dad a really hard time if it didn\u2019t pan out. We had to be immersed, and he knew it.\u201d Otherwise, Benjamin would read his Mickey Mouse magazines, Guido would play the guitar and their mom would start talking about everything she had to do that day \u2014\u00a0like two loads of laundry. \u201cThe Mickey Mouse magazine \u2014 this is how the urban legend goes \u2014 was his (Klaus\u2019) test to see what was more interesting to me \u2013 the game or the MM magazine?\u201d Benjamin Teuber says. \u201cIf I started looking into it (the magazine) while playing, he knew he needed to get back to the basement and continue.\u201d The expansion game the family played that day 10 years ago did end up becoming something, says Benjamin Teuber \u2014 but it took multiple iterations to get there.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/11/us/creating-catan-board-games-card-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_us_lake-champlain-plane-crash-1971", "text": "Kristina Nikita Coffey was four years old when the plane her father had boarded lost contact with air controllers and disappeared over Lake Champlain in Vermont on a snowy night in 1971. The crash site was never found, but over the years she held out hope it would be uncovered, steadily accumulating newspaper clippings and documents related to the case. So it was a surprise when her cousin, Barbara Nikitas, called on May 28 with news: An underwater searcher had found the jet\u00a0on which her father,\u00a0George Nikita, had embarked with four other men 53 years ago. \u201cWhen I called her, I think she was stunned because we didn\u2019t know Garry was doing the search,\u201d Nikitas told CNN, referring to the searcher. \u201cIt was a shock on all levels.\u201d After seeing the photos of the jet underwater, Nikita Coffey says she knew it was the right plane. \u201cI knew it,\u201d she said of the plane carrying her father. \u201cI\u2019ve looked at that picture of the plane my whole entire life.\u201d What happened aboard the plane that night is still a mystery. On January 27, 1971, the aircraft departed Burlington, Vermont, toward Providence, Rhode Island. The takeoff appeared normal to the control tower, according to Garry Kozak, the underwater searcher who found the jet. But shortly after takeoff, the controller lost\u00a0all radar contact. There was no mayday or communication from the jet, Kozak says. On board were Nikita, Donald Myers, Robert R. Williams, III, Frank B. Wilder and Kirby Windsor. An initial search for the jet was unsuccessful, Kozak says. It was winter and the bitter cold temperatures had frozen the lake, making immediate subsequent searches impossible. By spring, the ice melted and searches recovered some debris from the plane. More search attempts followed.\u00a0Over the next 53 years, more than 17 searches were carried out to find the plane, all unsuccessful, according to Kozak. Kozak\u00a0first learned of the plane crash from a friend in the 1980s. The fact that so many attempts had failed intrigued him. \u201cI\u2019ve always been challenged by finding stuff underwater, so\u00a0that was the personal satisfaction for me to solve something that everybody else had sort of forgotten,\u201d Kozak told CNN. \u201cSecondly, for the family because I had spoken with some of the family members back in 2014 when one of the searches was being put together.\u201d When searches were conducted, Kozak believes the plane was within the searched areas but had been overlooked on scans. \u201cI\u2019ve worked on many aircraft crashes over the years, but I have a pretty big mental library on the kind of anomaly I should be watching for when I read data,\u201d Kozak said. Kozak says in his field some may overlook what seems to be a pile of rocks. Frank K. Wilder,\u00a0the son of passenger Frank B. Wilder, agrees. He says he knew the plane was going to be hard to find based on this fact. \u201cMost people think the airplane is in one piece and\u00a0it\u2019s on the bottom and that would be easy to find, but in reality\u00a0the plane is debris to a lot of small pieces and that\u2019s a lot harder to identify,\u201d Wilder said. Lost and found again The jet was found in approximately 200 feet of water west of Juniper Island, about 3 miles from Burlington. From the video and pictures captured, experts could see the plane\u2019s red and black accent stripes. Nearby, they also saw\u00a0two turbine engines and a broken wing. The wreck site was left undisturbed. Even though it was\u00a0over 53 years ago, the passengers\u2019 children still remember the day their lives changed forever. \u201cI remember my mom just crying and this terrible scream. I\u00a0don\u2019t think I really understood at that point what it all meant,\u201d Wilder said. Nikitas still remembers the impact the crash had on her mother. \u201cMy mother and her two brothers were very close. They were always there for each other, and I think she felt like, \u2018I can\u2019t be there for my brother. I can\u2019t find him. I can\u2019t properly bury.\u2019 That always resonated with me,\u201d she said. After many years of search attempts and some false leads, families had to move on,\u00a0said Charles C. Williams,\u00a0son of Robert Williams, III. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain the limbo that this created,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSix months turns into a year and a year turns into two and there\u2019s just been no answers. That\u2019s really super, super hard on families.\u201d But the search never stopped for many of them. With her cousin, Nikita Coffey started reaching out to other families cited in the news articles she saved. They say their group has been a source of support. \u201cThis event happened, and I think it\u2019s probably fair to say we all went our separate ways. You live your life and you feel like you\u2019re carrying this burden by yourself,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s been wonderful because most people don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re going through, but with this group, we understand and it\u2019s nice to have that support,\u201d Wilder added. As more news outlets report the story, Williams says that people have reached out amid a resurgence of details about the case. \u201cFor them to have been lost and now kind of found again. I think it\u2019s really neat that people are seeing that and reaching out, but for the families it\u2019s also got a sense of sadness to it because now we know,\u201d Williams said. Nikita Coffey thanks every person who volunteered their time to help them find the crash site. Those many searches allowed them to cross locations off when another one began. \u201cThey\u2019re family now. I can\u2019t say enough about them. I can\u2019t thank them enough for their tireless effort,\u201d\u00a0Nikita Coffey said. Now that the crash site was found, the\u00a0National Transportation Safety Board will make its evaluation to confirm it\u2019s the right aircraft. The agency has received an information package about the case from the Federal Aviation Administration, according to a NTSB spokesperson. \u201cWe will be evaluating the specifics of what was found, and the degree of certainty to which we are able to positively link it back to the wreckage that was located. Following that, if and when any of that wreckage were recovered, we would determine what level of examination would be appropriate given what is recovered and what condition it is in,\u201d spokesperson Peter C. Knudson told CNN in a statement. While the crash site may have been found, it\u2019s important to the passengers\u2019 children the next generation also knows about their fathers. \u201cThat\u2019s what we really want to get across,\u201d she said. \u201c(They were)\u00a0five amazing men that left a hole in many people\u2019s hearts because of their loss, not just their family, their colleagues, their friends.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/us/lake-champlain-plane-crash-1971/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_media_washington-post-will-lewis-phone-hacking", "text": "A report from the New York Times on Saturday alleges\u00a0Will Lewis, the Washington Post\u2019s embattled new publisher and chief executive,\u00a0used fraudulent and unethical methods\u00a0to obtain information for articles while working at the London-based Sunday Times\u00a0in the early 2000s. Citing a former co-worker of Lewis\u2019, a private investigator and its own investigation of newspaper archives, the New York Times said Lewis used phone and company records that were\u00a0\u201cfraudulently obtained\u201d\u00a0through hacking and paying sources for information. Through the haze of accusations, it remains unclear whether these claims will prompt Lewis to step down from the helm of one of the most distinguished outlets in the country. Even so, experts see Lewis\u2019 grasp on the newsroom as one that is increasingly weakening. Margaret Sullivan, executive director of the Craig\u00a0Newmark Center for Journalism Ethics and Security at Columbia University\u2019s School of Journalism, told CNN on Sunday that Lewis\u2019 position is \u201cincreasingly untenable.\u201d These latest allegations of\u00a0questionable\u00a0journalistic ethics could also leave an enduring impression on a newsroom already reeling from the blindsiding ouster of its executive editor,\u00a0Sally Buzbee. The allegations may also end up reflecting on the paper\u2019s own reputation as a standard-bearer for American journalism. Late on Sunday, the Washington Post itself published a story about Robert Winnett, whom Lewis appointed to take the top job at the Post\u2019s core newsroom after the US presidential election in November. The Post article alleged that Winnett, a Lewis protege, was linked to a man who used dishonest means to obtain information that Winnett\u00a0then used in his journalism. In a statement, the Washington Post said: \u201cWe cover The Washington Post independently, rigorously and fairly. Given perceived and potential conflicts, we have asked former senior managing editor Cameron Barr, who stepped down from that position in 2023 and now has a contractual relationship as a senior associate editor, to oversee this coverage. The publisher has no involvement in or influence on our reporting.\u201d In a follow-up on Monday, the Post added that \u201cThe executive editor and relevant masthead editors review and provide input, with Cameron\u2019s concurrence, to ensure that our work meets our highest standards.\u201d Winnett did not immediately respond to a CNN query via LinkedIn. The Society of Professional Journalists, which represents about 7,000 members across the country and whose journalism standards\u00a0are recognized in\u00a0many newsrooms, warns journalists in its\u00a0Code of Ethics: \u201cDo not pay for access to news.\u201d While SPJ does not explicitly address hacking as a means of newsgathering, it does tell journalists to \u201cavoid undercover or other surreptitious methods of gathering information unless traditional, open methods will not yield information vital to the public\u201d but cautions that \u201cpursuit of the news is not a license for arrogance of\u00a0undue intrusiveness.\u201d The new accusations come as Lewis tries to fend off resurfacing allegations of his involvement in a UK phone hacking scandal coverup, in which he has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.\u00a0Lewis has\u00a0previously said\u00a0his role in the scandal consisted of rooting out problematic behavior. A spokesperson for the Washington Post told CNN Lewis declined to comment. A Washington Post source with knowledge of internal meetings at the paper last week told CNN that Lewis has told employees \u201chis role as publisher is to create the environment for great journalism and to encourage and support it, that he will never interfere in the journalism and that he is very clear about the lines that should not be crossed.\u201d The\u00a0decade-old scandal\u00a0engulfed right-wing media mogul Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News of the World tabloid and was revived in recent years in a\u00a0new lawsuit filed\u00a0by Prince Harry and Hollywood figures including Guy Ritchie and Hugh Grant. At the time of the News of the World controversy, Lewis was a senior executive at Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation. But a cascade of claims has followed Lewis in recent weeks, mostly involving\u00a0alleged attempts to suppress stories about his connection with the coverup. Earlier this month, the New York Times first reported that Lewis, who took the reins at the Washington Post on January 2, clashed with\u00a0Buzbee\u00a0over publishing an article in May that named him in connection to the scandal,\u00a0although a\u00a0spokesperson for Lewis has denied he pressured Buzbee\u00a0to quash the article, according to NPR.  Buzbee abruptly left the company earlier this month. Days later, an NPR reporter said Lewis offered him an interview in exchange for quashing a forthcoming article about the scandal. The Washington Post did not respond to CNN with regard to these allegations. A spokesperson for Lewis\u00a0told the New York Times earlier this month\u00a0when the story broke that \u201cwhen he was a private citizen ahead of joining The Washington Post, he had off the record conversations with an employee of NPR about a story the employee then published.\u201d The spokesperson added that any request for an interview after he joined the Washington Post was \u201cprocessed through the normal corporate communication channels.\u201d Buzbee\u2019s departure has seemingly frayed Lewis\u2019 command of his newsroom even further. A number of Post staffers who spoke to CNN have described plummeting morale. \u201cIt\u2019s as bad as I\u2019ve ever seen it, truly,\u201d one staffer said earlier this month, noting that the Washington Post has hit \u201crough patches\u201d before but that the stormy atmosphere hanging over the outlet is unprecedented. In an opinion piece for the Guardian on Wednesday, Sullivan wrote that firing Lewis and finding a new CEO is \u201cthe cleanest, best move\u201d Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos could make. Lewis\u2019 insistence on tamping down reporting about him \u201chas motivated several news organizations to look more deeply into his past; it\u2019s possible that some new revelation will make his Post leadership position even more untenable and will force Bezos\u2019 hand,\u201d she added. Sullivan also wrote in her op-ed that Lewis could try to repair the trust both within and outside the newsroom by acknowledging that he will not cross any ethical lines and reiterating his commitment to giving staffers \u201ctrue editorial independence.\u201d He could also work toward reinstating an independent public editor or ombudsman \u2014 a position the Washington Post nixed more than a decade ago \u2014 who would oversee the paper\u2019s implementation of journalistic ethics.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/media/washington-post-will-lewis-phone-hacking/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_us_cal-state-palestinian-protests", "text": "Pro-Palestinian protesters who entered and barricaded themselves in a building at California State University, Los Angeles, on Wednesday cleared out by early Thursday, a spokesperson for the school told CNN. Most protesters left the Student Services Building of their own accord around 1:15 a.m. local time and returned to an unauthorized encampment on campus. No arrests were made, university spokesperson Erik Frost Hollins said. A small group remained inside but the university\u2019s Department of Public Safety officers entered the building and asked them to leave, and they complied, Hollins said. University President Berenecea Johnson Eanes, whose office is in the building, according to the university\u2019s website, was among dozens of employees who remained inside during the takeover. She and other administrators were safely escorted out after midnight Thursday, Hollins said. The group of 50 to 100 protesters barricaded the exits on the first floor on Wednesday and blocked off areas around the building, Hollins told the Los Angeles Times. The university asked employees on the upper floors to shelter in place, Hollins said. Video from CNN affiliate\u00a0KABC showed protesters moving furniture on the first floor of the building with signs on windows and plywood spray-painted with the messages, \u201cThe time to escalate is now!\u201d and \u201cCSU stop funding genocide.\u201d Demonstrators \u201cdon\u2019t want folks inside the building,\u201d a protester told KABC, saying, \u201cThis is not a hostage situation.\u201d The university called the Los Angeles Police Department to assist, CNN affiliate\u00a0KCAL/KCBS reported. \u201cSignificant\u201d damage including broken glass and graffiti was observed on the interior and exterior of the building, primarily the first four floors, according to Hollins. All classes and operations at\u00a0the university\u2019s main campus will be held remotely until further notice, according to a message posted on its\u00a0website. \u201cPlease do not come to main campus,\u201d the Protest Action Alert reads. Meanwhile, operations on Cal State\u2019s downtown campus will remain normal, the alert said. An assessment will be done to determine the overall cost of the damage and when the building, which houses services like financial aid and student support, will reopen. \u201cIt will take time to recover and to provide these services in the same way that we were able to before, and that\u2019s deeply unfortunate,\u201d Hollins said. On Thursday, Eanes ordered the encampment that has been on the campus for the past 40 days to be dismantled following what she referred to in a statement as \u201cviolence and destruction\u201d that unfolded Wednesday night, according to the university. \u201cKnow that we will recover from this, but also know that I am committed to doing everything we can to ensure this will never be allowed to repeat,\u201d the university\u2019s president said. \u201cThe Encampment has crossed a line. Those in the Encampment must leave.\u201d Eanes did not give a timeline of when the encampment will be dismantled or if the university would request assistance from law enforcement. Three employees and a student were reportedly assaulted during the protest \u2013 one person was assaulted as the protesters entered the university building, another as they were leaving, one was \u201caccosted on a walkway\u201d and another who was looking at damage, said Eanes, who did not say if they were injured. The demonstrations escalated due to frustration with university officials who sent a message regarding encampments, which \u201creiterated something \u2026 said 20 days ago,\u201d a protester told KABC. The protesters\u2019 actions at Cal State, Los Angeles, come as some American campuses continue to be convulsed by pro-Palestinian demonstrations denouncing Israel\u2019s handling of its war against Hamas in Gaza. Protests late this spring gripped schools across the country, but they have persisted in some places, including at UCLA \u2013 some 20 miles west of Cal State, Los Angeles \u2013 where 27 people were arrested Monday after setting up multiple pro-Palestinian encampments that police said were unlawful. Additionally, at least six University of California Police Department personnel and other safety officers were injured in confrontations with the protesters, including one person with a head injury, Rick Braziel, UCLA\u2019s associate vice chancellor for campus safety, said in\u00a0a news release Tuesday. Of those arrested at UCLA, 18 were students, and two were faculty, police said. Another was a former student, while the rest were not affiliated with the university.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked at a press conference in Italy last week about whether China was selling Russia arms for use in the war. Biden, who was standing beside him, waited for Zelensky to say President Xi Jinping told him he would not do so, before delivering a parting shot and ending the event. \u201cBy the way, China is not supplying weapons but the ability to produce those weapons and the technology available to do it.\u00a0So, it is, in fact, helping Russia.\u201d The comment appeared to signal a hardening tone toward Beijing following months of US warnings that it shouldn\u2019t help its friends in Moscow over the war. NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg reinforced the tough new line during a visit to Washington Monday that included Oval Office talks with Biden. \u201cPublicly, President Xi has tried to create the impression that he\u2019s taking a back seat in this conflict to avoid sanctions and keep trade flowing. But the reality is that China\u2019s fueling the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II,\u201d Stoltenberg said at The Wilson Center. \u201cAt the same time, it wants to maintain good relations with the West. Well, Beijing cannot have it both ways. At some point, and unless China changes course, allies need to impose a cost.\u201d Concerns that America\u2019s enemies are aiding Russia\u2019s war effort are sure to grow with the impending trip by Putin to North Korea, which the Kremlin said would have a \u201cvery eventful\u201d list of events, including with the isolated Stalinist state\u2019s tyrannical leader Kim Jong Un. The idea of an anti-US front among Russia, China, North Korea and Iran has long preoccupied foreign policy experts in Washington. Up until recently, US intelligence agencies have assessed that differences between the uneasy partners make formal alliances unlikely. But all those powers have one big thing in common: a desire to thwart American goals and power. Each is also subject to a brutal autocratic regime that is threatened by the democracy that unites the US and its European and Asian allies. The announcement that Putin is headed to Pyongyang raised the state of alert in Washington. In March, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told Congress that Russia\u2019s need to replenish its military supplies had forced it to grant \u201clong-sought concessions\u201d to North Korea. She did not specify the extent of the cooperation, but her comment sparked speculation that Moscow was offering nuclear or missile expertise. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell added to the intrigue last week when he said at a Stimson Center event that the North Koreans have embarked on a series of \u201cprovocative\u201d actions including by supplying Russia with artillery and missiles. And he added: \u201cWe have a very good understanding of what North Korea has provided Russia and they have had a substantial impact on the battlefield.\u201d But the US doesn\u2019t seem to know what Kim will get in return. \u201cWhat is Russia going to provide in exchange to North Korea,\u00a0hard currency? Is it energy? Is it capabilities that allow them to advance their nuclear or missile products?\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know but we are concerned by that and are watching carefully.\u201d He added: \u201cThe entire scope of the Russia/North Korea relationship is something we follow carefully and are concerned about.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/politics/us-alarm-china-north-korea-russia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "us"}}

The bottles were found in five storage pits in the mansion\u2019s cellar, with 29 of them\u00a0intact and containing \u201cperfectly preserved cherries and berries, likely gooseberries or currants,\u201d\u00a0according to a news release\u00a0from George Washington\u2019s Mount Vernon on Thursday. Crews unearthed the 18th-century bottles during the ongoing $40 million\u00a0revitalization\u00a0project launched last year at Mount Vernon, Virginia. The bottles were extracted from the pits and refrigerated, and are expected to undergo scientific analysis, the release states. The slowly drying bottles, \u201ccomposed of materials and foodstuffs that are likely 250 years old,\u201d will be sent from Mount Vernon\u2019s archaeology lab to an off-site location for conservation, according to the release. The latest discovery comes after\u00a0the\u00a0recent find\u00a0of two intact European-manufactured glass bottles,\u00a0also from the 18th century,\u00a0filled with liquid, cherries and pits in the same cellar, according to the organization. \u201cNow we know those bottles were just the beginning of this blockbuster discovery,\u201d Mount Vernon President and CEO Doug Bradburn said in a statement. Bradburn referred to the discoveries as \u201can unprecedented find,\u201d adding that \u201cnothing of this scale and significance has ever been excavated in North America.\u201d \u201cThe bottles and contents are a testament to the knowledge and skill of the enslaved people who managed the food preparations from tree to table,\u201d said Jason Boroughs, Mount Vernon principal archaeologist. The bottles may have been forgotten when Washington left Mount Vernon to take command of the Continental Army, according to Bradburn. \u201cThese artifacts likely haven\u2019t seen the light of day since before the American Revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so appropriate that these bottles have been unearthed shortly before the 250th anniversary of the United States.\u201d Bradburn added that the organization\u2019s team is hopeful the cherry pits may be viable for future germination. Mount Vernon partnered with the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s Agricultural Research Service to analyze the bottles\u2019 contents. In the early stages of analysis, researchers identified 54 cherry pits and 23 stems, suggesting the bottles were likely full of cherries at one point, according to the release. \u201cThe cherries likely are of a tart variety, which has a more acidic composition that may have aided in preservation,\u201d the release states. The cherries are likely candidates for DNA extraction, which could help researchers compare them against a database to identify their exact species, according to\u00a0the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/us/george-washington-mount-vernon-cherries-berries-trnd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "us"}}

The company had worked with IBM to develop and test AI-driven, voice-automated ordering at some of its restaurants. The fast food giant says it\u2019s still working on AI-related solutions at a time when its rivals are making similar investments. It plans to shut off the technology in restaurants participating in the test \u201cno later than July 26, 2024,\u201d according to reporting from trade publication Restaurant Business. \u201cIBM remains a trusted partner and we will still utilize many of their products across our global System,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said in an email sent to franchisees and shared with CNN. But the company suggested it will look at AI partners other than IBM. McDonald\u2019s and IBM launched their partnership in 2021, announcing the development of Automated Order Taking (AOT) technology to create a more convenient and simplified ordering experience for its customers and restaurant teams as a part of its \u201cAccelerating the Arches\u201d growth plan.

{"id": "2024_06_16_us_reparations-targeted-by-conservatives-advocates-fight-back", "text": "A conservative group\u2019s lawsuit against a reparations program in Evanston, Illinois, that provides some Black residents with cash payments and housing assistance, has left advocates for reparations worried this could be the first of many attacks on their efforts to redress the harms of slavery, segregation and systemic racism in the United States. The complaint, filed against the city last month by Judicial Watch, claims Evanston\u2019s program violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, and asks the court to declare the city\u2019s \u201cuse of race as an eligibility requirement for participation in the program to be unconstitutional.\u201d The argument follows a legal strategy frequently employed by conservative activists to attempt to undercut programs dedicated to addressing racial disparities in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn affirmative action in college admissions. As the nation prepares to observe Juneteenth \u2014 the federal holiday on June 19 that commemorates the end of slavery in the US \u2014 reparations advocates tell CNN they are bracing for potentially more lawsuits against their programs, but stand firm in their commitment to finding ways to rectify the centuries of racism Black Americans and their families have endured. Under the Evanston reparations program, Black residents who lived in the city between 1919 and 1969 \u2013 as well as their direct descendants \u2013 can apply for up to $25,000 in housing assistance, CNN previously reported. The program was established in 2019 and amended last year to provide the option of a direct cash payment. Robin Rue Simmons, chair of the Evanston Reparations Committee, said the \u201clawsuit comes as no surprise and Evanston is prepared to defend this case.\u201d \u201cThis is not just an attack on Evanston,\u201d Rue Simmons said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThis is an attack on the movement for reparations. This is an attack on the overall movement for the advancement of reparatory justice, racial equity, and civil rights.\u201d Judicial Watch\u2019s lawsuit was filed on behalf of six people whose parents or grandparents lived in Evanston during the 50-year period the program covers but do not identify as Black or African American. \u201cAt no point in the application process are persons in the first and second groups required to present evidence that they or their ancestors experienced housing discrimination or otherwise suffered harm because of an unlawful Evanston ordinance, policy, or procedure or some other unlawful act or series of acts by Evanston between 1919 and 1969,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cIn effect, Evanston is using race as a proxy for having experienced discrimination during this time period.\u201d Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton told CNN in an interview that he believes Evanston\u2019s reparations program is a \u201cbrazen violation of the constitution and federal law.\u201d \u201cGenerally speaking, you can\u2019t treat people based on race and provide benefits to some and not others based on generalized complaints of historic racism,\u201d Fitton said. \u201cThe courts frown upon it.\u201d A spokesperson for the city of Evanston previously told CNN officials will not comment on pending legislation but will \u201cvehemently defend\u201d its reparations program. Justin Hansford, a commissioner for the National African American Reparations Commission,\u00a0rejected Judicial Watch\u2019s interpretation of the legality of reparations programs. \u201cJim Crow was based on race, redlining was based on race, housing segregation was based on race,\u201d Hansford said. \u201cIn all those situations you had a community that was harmed based on race. So now when you\u2019re trying to give that community justice, you are going to naturally give it to the same group.\u201d Fitton said it\u2019s possible he may file lawsuits against other reparations programs.\u00a0The Evanston lawsuit comes as states and cities across the country have formed commissions to explore how reparations can be distributed and who should receive them. The push for reparations and a making Juneteenth a federal holiday gained momentum following the racial reckoning in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s murder in 2020. But four years later, reparations and other race-based programs such as internships and scholarships across the country are continuing to face roadblocks following the gutting of affirmative action. On Wednesday, the Oklahoma Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit that argued that the remaining survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre should be compensated by the city for damages, dealing a blow to their ongoing fight for reparations. And earlier this month, a federal appeals court blocked the Black-owned venture capitalist firm Fearless Fund from awarding grants exclusively to Black women entrepreneurs. Some reparations leaders say they have taken more race-neutral approaches to their programs with hopes of avoiding legal battles.\u00a0Kamilah Moore, chair of California\u2019s Reparations Task Force, said her commission recommended that the state\u2019s program be \u201clineage based\u201d meaning residents who apply for it would have to provide proof that their ancestors were enslaved or free African Americans who lived in the U.S. prior to 1900. Moore said the commission believes their lineage-based approach is constitutional. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say there may not still be a challenge to lineage-based programs by these same groups,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut as lineage-based reparations advocates we are confident in our position from a moral, ethical and legal perspective.\u201d The task force has also recommended payments to residents based on the harms suffered from inequities such as housing segregation, mass incarceration, over policing, devaluation of Black businesses, and health disparities. The recommendations have been packaged in bills that are awaiting full approval from the California State Legislature, she said. In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul signed legislation in December to establish a reparations commission that would study the lingering effects of slavery on New York residents and make recommendations for how the state could address \u201clongstanding inequities.\u201d Jennifer Jones Austin, a member of the New York commission\u00a0and CEO of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, said they are looking to take a more holistic approach to reparations that may include individual payments, investment in Black communities and redressing laws to advance equity and equal opportunity for Black people. Jones Austin said she expected there would be legal challenges to reparations efforts given all the recent attacks on policies and programs created to repair the harms Black Americans have suffered. She said she worries New York could be targeted but is confident the commission is doing everything possible to work within the law. \u201cYou have to make sure you are dotting your I\u2019s and crossing your T\u2019s in any work you do that is controversial especially when it comes to money,\u201d Jones Austin said. \u201cIt does make the work more challenging.\u201d Areva Martin, a civil rights lawyer and reparations advocate, said she was not surprised by the lawsuit against Evanston. Martin said she believes conservatives have been emboldened by the gutting of affirmative action and are using the decision to sue other race-based initiatives. \u201cAnybody would be naive to not be aware of these very calculated and very orchestrated and planned attacks,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBut what I want people to know and what I want the message to be is that we are not going away. We are not going to shrink, we are not going to cower, we are not going to be intimidated.\u201d Hansford said he hopes the lawsuit against Evanston motivates supporters to rally around reparations programs. \u201cIt\u2019s a call to arms,\u201d Hansford said. \u201cWe know this is just the opening salvo in a long running struggle. People around the country should realize how real the reparations movement has become.\u201d CNN\u2019s Justin Gamble and Andy Rose contributed to this report.\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/us/reparations-targeted-by-conservatives-advocates-fight-back/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "us"}}

Whitehead was found guilty in March of two counts of wire fraud, as well as one count each of attempted wire fraud, attempted extortion and making false statements to federal law enforcement agents. The convictions are from three separate schemes. In addition to his prison sentence, the 45-year-old New Jersey man\u00a0\u201cwas sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to pay $85,000 in restitution and forfeit $95,000,\u201d\u00a0according to a news release from the US attorney\u2019s office and court documents. \u201cLamor Whitehead is a con man who stole millions of dollars in a string of financial frauds and even stole from one of his own parishioners.\u00a0He lied to federal agents, and again to the Court at his trial.\u00a0Today\u2019s\u00a0sentence puts an end to Whitehead\u2019s various schemes and reflects this Office\u2019s commitment to bring accountability to those who abuse their positions of trust,\u201d US Attorney\u00a0for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said in the news release. One of Whitehead\u2019s attorneys has previously said they plan to appeal. CNN has reached out to Whitehead\u2019s lawyer for comment. Known for his Louis Vuitton suits and extravagant jewelry, Whitehead was a pastor at the Leaders of\u00a0Tomorrow International Ministries in Brooklyn. He made headlines in 2022 after he said he and his wife were\u00a0robbed of $1 million\u00a0worth of jewelry at their church. Prosecutors said Whitehead defrauded one of his parishioners by convincing her to invest approximately $90,000 of her retirement savings with him so he could help her buy a home; however, he ended up spending the money on luxury goods and personal expenses instead,\u00a0according to\u00a0an indictment. Whitehead also extorted a businessman for $5,000 and then attempted to convince the man to loan him $500,000 and grant him a stake\u00a0in real estate transactions in exchange for obtaining\u00a0\u201cfavorable actions by the New York City government\u201d\u00a0that he knew he could not provide, the indictment said. Whitehead used his ties to New York City Mayor Eric Adams to try to make the deal, the US attorney\u2019s office said in a\u00a0March news release. He also submitted a fraudulent application for a $250,000 business loan that included doctored bank statements, which falsely claimed he had millions of dollars in the bank and hundreds of thousands of dollars in monthly revenue,\u00a0according\u00a0to the US attorney\u2019s office news release. Whitehead\u00a0had \u201csubmitted similar fraudulent applications to various other financial institutions, stealing millions of dollars in the process,\u201d the release\u00a0said. And when speaking to FBI agents who were executing a search warrant outside his New Jersey mansion, Whitehead made false statements by telling the agents he only had one phone, when he actually had two, according to the indictment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/us/bling-bishop-lamor-whitehead-sentenced-fraud-extortion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_media_alex-jones-infowars-shut-down", "text": "Alex Jones\u2019\u00a0notorious\u00a0conspiracy\u00a0platform Infowars may have survived a\u00a0key decision from a federal judge last week, but the platform\u2019s future is far from secure. A bankruptcy judge in Houston on Friday allowed Jones to liquidate his personal assets to help pay the nearly $1.5 billion that he owes the families of the Sandy Hook massacre victims but dismissed the\u00a0separate\u00a0bankruptcy\u00a0case\u00a0of Infowars\u2019 parent company Free Speech Systems. The dismissal is not a reflection on Jones or whatever the judge might feel about Infowars. Rather, it was a question of economic reality \u2013 how the judge could help the families get the most value out of Jones and Infowars. \u201cThis case is one of the more difficult cases I\u2019ve had,\u201d Judge Christopher\u00a0Lopez said during a lengthy and at times emotional ruling. \u201cI was never asked today to make a decision to shut down a show or not. That was never going to happen today one way or another.\u201d What the judge decided Lopez approved Jones\u2019 request to liquidate his personal assets to help pay off his debts, but dismissed a request to \u201cconvert\u201d Free Speech Systems\u2019 bankruptcy to liquidation. Some of the Sandy Hook families had requested the judge move to liquidate Jones\u2019 Free Speech Systems company. They\u00a0argued it would not only dismantle a platform that had caused so much agony but would also ensure a fair way to dole out the proceeds of a sell-off. But\u00a0a\u00a0handful of\u00a0other families had argued against liquidation. The reasoning: Liquidation is a lengthy and costly process, and the families have yet to see a dime from the more than a billion dollars Jones owes them. Lopez noted that this may be one of the longest-running cases of its kind in the country. Because the company is not in liquidation, the families can immediately go after Free Speech System\u2019s assets in state courts, a much faster and less costly process (liquidation would have involved various bankruptcy professionals who take a lot of fees). \u201cI have to do what\u2019s in the best interest of credito\ufeffrs,\u201d Lopez said on Friday, adding, \u201cWhen you look at it, I think creditors are better served in pursuing their state court rights.\u201d Since Jones is the owner of Free Speech Systems, and Jones himself is in bankruptcy, the families can go after the company\u2019s assets. In a sadly ironic twist, the more money Jones makes by broadcasting his lies and conspiracy theories on Infowars, the more of the nearly $1.5 billion he owes to the families could actually be paid. What happens to Infowars For now, nothing changes for Jones\u2019 Infowars shows. The company can continue operating, and Jones is free to say what he wants \u2013 including commenting about Sandy Hook \u2013 as he wishes. But Jones\u2019 personal stake in the company is part of his own personal liquidation. Because of Jones\u2019 bankruptcy, Free Speech Systems is now in the hands of a court-appointed trustee. It\u2019s not clear what that trustee will do - either keep Free Speech Systems operating or sell it off. \u201cI do not now own Infowars,\u201d Jones said during an \u201cemergency\u201d show on Saturday. \u201cIt is now controlled by the court trustee. I am the CEO and the decision maker.\u201d Jay Westbrook,\u00a0a University of Texas bankruptcy law professor, said\u00a0the personal bankruptcy trustee will take over Jones\u2019s interest in Free Speech Systems. \u201c(The trustee) will work to maximize the value of Jones\u2019s shares for the benefit of his creditors, including the possibility of selling Jones\u2019s shares,\u201d Westbrook said. Jones said on Saturday he estimates the company has up to five more months before some sort of sale. \u201cIf we make it a few more months\u2026 if we make it that, we\u2019ll survive, under new management and ownership but I\u2019ll still be as host here, I\u2019ll still be in control of what I say or I won\u2019t be here,\u201d Jones said on Saturday. \u201cBut we just got more runway.

Lopez will likely schedule a new hearing to determine the trustee\u2019s powers. But no matter what happens to the company, Jones still owes nearly $1.5 billion. If Free Speech Systems continues operating and making money for Jones, those funds will ultimately need to go to paying the families. \u201cOnce Jones\u2019s bankruptcy case ends, the families can start to use state court collection tools (garnishment, attachment, foreclosure) to get paid from income that Jones earns and any property he acquires since he filed for bankruptcy until their judgments are paid in full,\u201d Marie Reilly, professor of bankruptcy law at Penn State University, told CNN. While Jones now acknowledges the Sandy Hook massacre took place, he is free to continue espousing dangerous rhetoric and conspiracy theories on his platforms.In recent days, Jones has fantasized on his show about executing\u00a0Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,\u00a0and others who supposedly \u201clied to\u00a0Trump.\u201d But even if Infowars is shut down, Jones can continue posting on his X account after it was restored last year by Elon Musk or join other high-profile platforms.

The suspect, 36-year-old Daniel Callihan, was arrested Thursday after a 35-year-old mother was found dead and her two abducted daughters were later discovered in Mississippi \u2013 one dead and the other alive \u2013 in what investigators say may be a human trafficking case. Callihan is accused of \u201ccommitting brutal and heinous acts of violence,\u201d including the killings of Callie Brunett and her 4-year-old daughter, said the sheriff\u2019s office in Tangipahoa Parish, just north of New Orleans. As Callihan was being escorted by officers\u00a0from the Jackson Police Department headquarters Friday, a reporter asked him why he allegedly killed the little girl. \u201cI have no reason\u00a0for\u00a0what I did,\u201d Callihan told reporters. He added that he\u2019s been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Callihan\u2019s alleged accomplice, Victoria Cox, 32, was arrested on Friday at a motel in south Jackson, Jackson Police Chief Joseph Wade said. Callihan said Friday that he has yet to talk to a lawyer.\u00a0The\u00a0Rankin County District Attorney\u2019s\u00a0Office told CNN\u00a0they were unaware if Callihan had retained an attorney. Cox is being questioned and police said they are trying to determine her exact role in the incident. \u201cBased on information that I got yesterday and early this morning, she is an acquaintance and possibly girlfriend of Mr. Callihan,\u201d Wade said. Jackson investigators said the wooded neighborhood where the girls were found showed signs the location could have been used for human trafficking, including small animal cages. \u201cOur hearts are with all those affected by this tragic event. These are unspeakable crimes,\u201d parish Sheriff Daniel Edwards said in a social media post. \u201cWe ask everyone to keep Callie\u2019s family in your prayers.\u201d Earlier Thursday, an Amber Alert was issued for Brunett\u2019s abducted daughters, ages 4 and 6, after the mother was found dead in her home, according to Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office Chief Jimmy Travis. After hours of searching, law enforcement in Jackson, Mississippi \u2013 about a 2-hour drive from Tangipahoa \u2013 tracked down the suspect and found a \u201ctragic scene,\u201d Wade said. After a short pursuit, Callihan was arrested in a wooded area near a house and the 4-year-old\u2019s body was found unburied in the woods behind the home, according to Wade. The other sister was found injured and was taken to a hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very disturbing to me as a police chief and as a father to witness and see what I just saw,\u201d Wade said of the scene. An autopsy will be conducted to determine the exact cause of death, Wade said Friday. Due to signs of \u201csome human trafficking done\u201d at the location, Jackson authorities have reached out to human trafficking divisions with the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and Hinds County, Wade said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work this crime scene with a scalpel,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a long time to process it.\u201d Many questions still remain, Wade said, including why Callihan allegedly took the children to Jackson and why the child was killed. Though Callihan had yet to be interviewed Thursday evening, investigators believe the suspect lives in Louisiana and had dated Brunett \u201coff and on,\u201d Travis said. When the Amber Alert was issued Thursday, it said a man, later identified as Callihan, was wanted \u201cfor questioning for a domestic violence incident, which occurred at the time of the abduction and resulted in a homicide.\u201d Investigators\u2019 top priority will be to interview Callihan and care for the surviving 6-year-old victim, Travis said. \u201cShe\u2019s been through something that most of us, hopefully, never ever get to experience. And she is going to have to spend the rest of her life living with this,\u201d the chief said. Police said Cox was compliant during her arrest and will be held accountable for her actions in the \u201chorrific event.\u201d \u201cShe could be possibly facing capital murder charges along with him or accessory before or after the fact,\u201d Wade said. \u201cWe have to bring justice for the loss of this child.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Jackson Police Department and the\u00a0Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office\u00a0for more information.

The Post Fire has burned 15,610 acres, and is 8% contained as of Monday afternoon,\u00a0according to\u00a0forest service officials at Angeles National Forest. More than a thousand firefighters are on scene, with more on their way, Los Angeles County Fire Department Section Chief Kenichi Ballew-Haskett told CNN Monday morning. \u201cWe\u2019re getting people on notice that if we have to issue a mandatory evacuation order that they need to leave,\u201d Ballew-Haskett said, advising people residents to have their bags packed, a full tank of gas and cell phones ready. \u201cOnce the sheriffs come by or law enforcement asks you to leave, it means the danger is imminent.\u201d The wildfire began Saturday afternoon in Gorman, an unincorporated community in northwestern Los Angeles County. The cause of the blaze is still under investigation, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire. California State Park Services evacuated 1,200 people from Hungry Valley Park, Cal Fire said. The fire had damaged two commercial properties by Saturday evening, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Evacuation orders are in place for areas west of Interstate 5 between Pyramid Lake and Gorman, and evacuation warnings are in place for areas south of Pyramid Lake between Old Ridge Route and the Los Angeles County line. Additional evacuation orders were issued Monday afternoon for the area south of Pyramid Lake, west of I-5, east of the County line and just north of the Templin Highway, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department said. As of Monday afternoon, the blaze is not spreading outside its current perimeter, but crews are still concerned about high winds that are supposed to continue through Tuesday afternoon, Fire Public Information Officer Flemming Bertelsen with the Los Padres National Forest\u00a0told CNN. Crews have been maintaining the perimeter of the fire by patrolling the line and looking for spot fires, Bertelsen\u00a0said. \u201cThe fire is not spreading in any significant manner right now, our lines are holding, but we have like 24 hours more of this wind,\u201d Bertelsen said, adding winds have been reaching 50 to 60 mph at the ridge tops. Low humidity is also a major concern, he said. \u201cWe are going to be tested, especially tonight,\u201d he said. The most active part of the fire is close to Piru Creek \u2013 and if it crosses the creek, the wildfire will enter heavy mountain terrain, he said. The National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned Sunday of wind gusts up to 60 to 70 mph, creating conditions that could potentially fuel the flames. A red flag warning was issued for the I-5 corridor in Los Angeles County and the Ventura County mountains until 5 p.m. Monday. Two adults and a child were taken to a hospital with minor injuries, CNN affiliate KABC reported, citing a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Crews are working to contain the fire and \u201caircraft are working to stop forward progress but have limited visibility,\u201d according to the fire department. Pyramid Lake is also closed because of the threat posed by the fire, the fire department said. Meanwhile in Northern California, the Point fire has burned more than 1,000 acres in Sonoma County and destroyed structures, according to Cal Fire. Evacuation orders were issued Sunday for some residents, with first responders going door to door to assist, the Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Office said. Overnight, officials deployed 36 fire engines, three helicopters, seven dozers, six hand crews and three water tenders to fight the fire, which was about 20% contained by Monday morning, Cal Fire reported. Another wildfire, the Aero fire, started southeast of Sacramento Monday afternoon and has grown with dangerous speed, consuming over 900 acres within just an hour and a half, Cal Fire said in\u00a0a post on Facebook. Strong winds are impacting firefighters\u2019 ability to establish a containment line, the post added. There are currently evacuation orders and warnings in place, according to the post, but aerials from CNN affiliate KCRA show the area is not densely populated.

His defense attorneys filed the motion seeking a new trial in the morning but then told the court to remove it from the docket, without publicly providing a reason.\u00a0Biden\u2019s lawyers have not responded to requests for comment. The now-removed\u00a0court filings argued\u00a0that there was a technical hiccup with the courts, related to Hunter Biden\u2019s pretrial appeals, that should\u2019ve prevented the trial judge from proceeding to a jury trial in Delaware. This challenge is similar to several of Biden\u2019s previous legal gambits to\u00a0delay or derail\u00a0the case, which have all fallen flat in court. \u201cThe Court empaneled a jury and proceeded to trial before the Court of Appeals returned jurisdiction to the Court by issuing its mandate. Consequently, the conviction must be vacated here,\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers told the trial judge in the Monday filing, which was reviewed by CNN before it was removed from the docket. The apparent\u00a0request for a new trial comes after\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s historic conviction\u00a0\u2013 the first time the son of a sitting US president went on trial while his father was in the White House. These latest legal maneuvers relate to what\u2019s called a \u201cmandate.\u201d When an appellate court hands down a decision, it notifies the lower court of that decision by issuing a \u201cmandate,\u201d often a couple days or weeks later. This mechanism is typically how the lower court gets back jurisdiction for the case, to proceed with the case as appropriate. In this case, Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers claimed in the Monday filing\u00a0that even though they lost their pretrial appeals, the 3rd\u00a0US\u00a0Circuit Court of Appeals never issued its final \u201cmandate\u201d that would\u2019ve returned the case back to District Judge Maryellen Noreika. She presided over a jury trial that began June 3 and ended last week with guilty verdicts on all charges. Noreika said in previous rulings that she believes Biden\u2019s appeals \u201cwill not independently divest this Court of jurisdiction\u201d and that her trial court and the federal appellate court \u201cshall have jurisdiction to proceed.\u201d The Delaware-based jury\u00a0found Hunter Biden guilty\u00a0of three felonies stemming from his October 2018 purchase of a revolver at a Wilmington gun shop. The jury unanimously concluded that he lied about his drug use on federal background check forms, and possessed the weapon while addicted to or using illegal drugs, which is a federal crime. Hunter Biden has spoken publicly about his lifelong struggle with alcoholism and his spiral into crack cocaine addiction after his brother Beau Biden died from cancer in 2015. Prosecutors\u00a0used his memoir against him, and also\u00a0relied on testimony\u00a0from three former romantic partners who said his rampant drug use destroyed their relationships. The president\u2019s son also is facing a separate trial on federal tax offenses, which is scheduled to begin in September.

{"id": "2024_06_17_media_surgeon-general-social-media-apps-warning-label", "text": "Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said the threat social media poses to children requires urgent action, and he demanded Congress to put a label on the apps as it does with cigarettes and alcohol. \u201cThe mental health crisis among young people is an emergency \u2014 and social media has emerged as an important contributor,\u201d Murthy said in an op-ed in the New York Times Monday. Murthy cited several studies, including a 2019 American Medical Association study published in JAMA that showed teens who spend three hours a day on social media double their risk of depression. Teens spend nearly five hours a day on social media apps, according to a Gallup poll. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Meg Tirrell, Murthy said that the prevalence of social media use among kids is over 95%, \u201cnearly universal.\u201d But Murthy cannot act unilaterally to put a warning label on apps \u2014 that requirement would have to come from Congress, with whom Murthy pleaded to pass a bill. \u201cI put forward this call for a warning because I think it\u2019s essential that parents know what we now know, which is that there are significant harms associated with social media use,\u201d Murthy told CNN. Similar labels on tobacco, first instituted in 1965, led to a steady decline in cigarette smoking in America over the past several decades. Congress has long chastised social media companies, claiming they pose harm to children. CEOs of tech companies have been grilled routinely on Capitol Hill, most notably Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 who publicly apologized to families whose children killed themselves because of online bullying and harassment. But Congress has taken little action to curb children\u2019s social media usage. Murthy argued that it\u2019s time for Congress to get serious about curbing children\u2019s use of social media. \u201cUntil that point in time, when we have reliable evidence that tells us social media is safe and changes are being made and will be made in the future\u2026 parents deserve to be warned. That\u2019s where the label comes in,\u201d Murthy told CNN, adding that he hopes Congress will introduce legislation to add a surgeon general\u2019s warning label on social media as soon as possible. \u201cI think this is an urgent issue.\u201d An escalating battle Murthy has warned about social media\u2019s harm to children\u2019s welfare for years. But Monday\u2019s declaration of an emergency and his appeal to Congress represent his most urgent call to action on the issue so far. In May 2023, Murthy issued an advisory that said there\u2019s not enough evidence to determine whether social media is safe enough for children and adolescents\u2019 mental health, saying social media use presents \u201ca profound risk of harm\u201d for kids. He suggested parents restrict their kids\u2019 social media use, saying 13 is too young to join social apps. But such advisories are designed to call attention to urgent public health \u2013 they don\u2019t require action. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a youth mental health crisis, and I\u2019m concerned that social media is contributing to the harm that kids are experiencing,\u201d Murthy told CNN in May 2023. \u201cFor too long, we have placed the entire burden of managing social media on the shoulders of parents and kids, despite the fact that these platforms are designed by some of the most talented engineers and designers in the world to maximize the amount of time that our kids spend on them.\u201d On CNN\u2019s \u201cChasing Life\u201d podcast with Dr. Sanjay Gupta in June 2023, Murthy outlined some steps parents can take to rein in their children\u2019s social media usage, including partnering with other parents to make sure kids lack the \u201cI\u2019m the only one without social media\u201d excuse. More action needed A warning label, if Congress passes legislation requiring one, would be insufficient to fix the problem, Murthy acknowledged. He suggested schools become phone-free environments for children, as should dinner time and other family events. And Murthy urged parents to restrict children\u2019s use of social media until they graduate from middle school. Several states have worked to pass legislation to increase the age at which children can begin to use social apps or some of their more time-sucking features, such as algorithms that push people to engage with more content within the app. The bills have been largely bipartisan. Florida\u2019s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in March signed a bill that would prohibit children under 14 from obtaining their own social media accounts, and children under 16 would need parental consent to have accounts. New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul said she would sign legislation passed by the state legislature that would ban social media from using algorithms in children\u2019s feeds, and the bill would also prevent tech companies from sharing information of children under 18. \u201cThis is much easier said than done, which is why parents should work together with other families to establish shared rules, so no parents have to struggle alone or feel guilty when their teens say they are the only one who has to endure limits,\u201d Murthy wrote in the New York Times. On Monday, Murthy confirmed to CNN that alcohol and cigarettes are currently the only two products with surgeon general warning labels but that the overall health risk of social media is \u201cjust as profound.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the mental health and wellbeing of kids,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/media/surgeon-general-social-media-apps-warning-label/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_us_swinomish-tribe-oil-train-trespassing", "text": "Seattle (AP) \u2014 BNSF Railway must pay nearly $400 million to a Native American tribe in Washington state, a federal judge ordered Monday after finding that the company intentionally trespassed when it repeatedly ran 100-car trains carrying crude oil across the tribe\u2019s reservation. US District Judge Robert Lasnik initially\u00a0ruled last year\u00a0that the railway deliberately violated the terms of a 1991 easement with the Swinomish Tribe north of Seattle that allows trains to carry no more than 25 cars per day. The judge held a trial earlier this month to determine how much in profits BNSF made through trespassing from 2012 to 2021 and how much it should be required to disgorge. The company based in Fort Worth, Texas, said in an email it had no comment on the judgment. The tribe, which has about 1,400 members, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The tribe sued in 2015 after BNSF dramatically increased, without the tribe\u2019s consent, the number of cars it was running across the reservation so that it could ship crude oil from the Bakken Formation in and around North Dakota to a nearby refinery. The route crosses sensitive marine ecosystems along the coast, over water that connects with the Salish Sea, where the tribe has treaty-protected rights to fish. Bakken oil is easier to refine into the fuels sold at the gas pump and ignites more easily. After train cars carrying Bakken crude oil exploded in Alabama, North Dakota and Quebec, a federal agency warned in 2014 that the oil has a higher degree of volatility than other crudes in the U.S. Last year, two BNSF engines derailed on Swinomish land, leaking an estimated 3,100 gallons (11,700 liters) of diesel fuel near Padilla Bay. The 1991 easement limited rail traffic to one train of 25 cars per day in each direction. It required BNSF to tell the tribe about the \u201cnature and identity of all cargo\u201d transported across the reservation, and it said the tribe would not arbitrarily withhold permission to increase the number of trains or cars. The tribe learned through a 2011 Skagit County planning document that a nearby refinery would start receiving crude oil trains. It wasn\u2019t until the following year that the tribe received information from BNSF addressing current track usage, court documents show. The tribe and BNSF discussed amending the agreement, but \u201cat no point did the Tribe approve BNSF\u2019s unilateral decision to transport unit trains across the Reservation, agree to increase the train or car limitations, or waive its contractual right of approval,\u201d Lasnik said in his decision last year. \u201cBNSF failed to update the Tribe regarding the nature of the cargo that was crossing the Reservation and unilaterally increased the number of trains and the number of cars without the Tribe\u2019s written agreement, thereby violating the conditions placed on BNSF\u2019s permission to enter the property,\u201d Lasnik said. The four-day trial this month was designed to provide the court with details and expert testimony to guide the judge through complex calculations about how much in \u201cill-gotten\u201d profit BNSF should have to disgorge. Lasnik put that figure at $362 million and added $32 million in post-tax profits such as investment income for a total of more than $394 million. In reality, the judge wrote, BNSF made far more than $32 million in post-tax profits, but adding all of that up would have added hundreds of millions more to what was already a large judgment against the railway.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/us/swinomish-tribe-oil-train-trespassing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_politics_george-norcross-racketeering", "text": "New Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross was charged Monday with operating a racketeering enterprise, threatening people whose properties he sought to take over, and orchestrating tax incentive legislation to benefit organizations he controlled. Norcross, seated in the front row during a news conference by New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin, angrily denounced the charges, later calling Platkin a \u201ccoward\u201d and demanding a speedy trial. The charges against the 68-year-old Norcross and five others come as New Jersey is already under a political and legal microscope, with Democratic Sen.\u00a0Bob Menendez on trial in New York\u00a0on federal corruption charges. Platkin, also a Democrat, cast the charges as law enforcement cracking down on wrongdoing. \u201cWhen we say no one is above the law, we mean it, and we will continue to hold accountable anyone who puts their interest above the public interest, no matter how powerful they may be,\u201d Platkin said. In a 111-page indictment unsealed Monday, the attorney general alleges a scheme reaching back to 2012 in which the defendants \u2014 called the \u201cNorcross Enterprise\u201d in the indictment \u2014 used his political influence to craft legislation that served their interests. Among the allegations against Norcross are charges that he threatened a developer who would not relinquish his rights to waterfront property in Camden, New Jersey, on Norcross\u2019 terms. The indictment cites a profanity-laden phone recording of Norcross in which he tells the developer he will face \u201cenormous consequences.\u201d The person asks whether Norcross is threatening him, according to the indictment. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Norcross replies. The indictment also said Norcross and the co-defendants extorted and coerced businesses with property rights on Camden\u2019s waterfront and obtained tax incentive credits, which they then sold for millions of dollars. Platkin described Camden as long suffering from economic decline. Defense lawyer Michael Critchley accused Platkin of having a \u201cvendetta\u201d against Norcross, noting that the waterfront development had been investigated for years by several agencies, including federal prosecutors in Philadelphia and New Jersey, as well as by Platkin\u2019s predecessor. \u201cAnd every agency that looked at this matter for the past seven years \u2026 came up with nothing,\u201d Critchley said at a news conference. Norcross, the executive chairman of the insurance firm Conner Strong & Buckelew, had been widely viewed as among the most influential unelected Democrats in the state. He was a Democratic National Committee member until 2021 and previously served as the head of the Camden County Democratic Party. A close friend to the former state Senate president, he was a behind-the-scenes power player and well-known financial backer to Democrats in the state and nationwide. Norcross, a resident of Palm Beach, Florida, who was once listed as a member of Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club, cast the prosecution as politically motivated. He said Platkin blamed southern New Jersey Democrats for fallout from\u00a0allegations that a staff member on Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy\u2019s 2017 gubernatorial campaign\u00a0had been sexually assaulted. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what that fallout was. Platkin was Murphy\u2019s general counsel when the state Legislature investigated the\u00a0allegations. \u201cI want Matt Platkin to come down here and try this case himself, because he\u2019s a coward, because he has forced people in this building to implement his will,\u201d Norcross said Monday outside the attorney general\u2019s office. In explaining why he appeared at the news conference, Norcross said, \u201cI want to witness an extraordinary embarrassment and outrageous conduct from a government official who stands up there and tries to act like he\u2019s holier than thou.\u201d The other defendants are Norcross\u2019 brother Philip Norcross, a New Jersey lawyer; William Tambussi, George Norcross\u2019 longtime lawyer; Dana Redd, Camden Community Partnership chief executive and former Camden mayor; Sidney Brown, chief executive of trucking and logistics company NFI; and development company executive John O\u2019Donnell. An attorney representing Philip Norcross called him a stellar lawyer with an \u201cunblemished reputation.\u201d \u201cThe notion that he would be charged with crimes is simply outrageous,\u201d Kevin Marino said. Marino declined to address specific allegations in the indictment. Philip Norcross and Rep. Donald Norcross of New Jersey are all brothers of George. Donald Norcross said in a statement that he looks forward to his brothers telling their side of the story. \u201cI love my brothers,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in the rule of law, and they will have the opportunity to defend themselves during their day in court.\u201d Henry Klingeman, Redd\u2019s attorney, said she was surprised by the charges. \u201cShe\u2019s done nothing wrong,\u201d Klingeman said. \u201cWhat she has done is serve the Camden community in public and not-for-profit roles for more than three decades. She has cooperated fully with the grand jury investigation for over a year and is unaware of evidence of wrongdoing by her or others.\u201d Messages seeking comment were left with a lawyer for Tambussi. Brown and O\u2019Donnell had no attorneys yet, according to the attorney general\u2019s office. Monday\u2019s indictment wasn\u2019t the first time the tax incentive has come under scrutiny. Murphy\u2019s administration ordered a task force to investigate tax incentives not long after he took office in 2018.\u00a0In 2019, Norcross disputed resulting allegations\u00a0that there was anything corrupt about the incentives that benefited his companies.

Morris, a senior pastor at Gateway Church and a member of\ufeff then-candidate Donald Trump\u2019s Evangelical Executive Advisory Board during the 2016 campaign, did not mention the name or age of the girl in his statement but said the inappropriate behavior lasted several years. \u201cWhen I was in my early twenties, I was involved in inappropriate sexual behavior with a young lady in a home where I was staying. It was kissing and petting and not intercourse, but it was wrong. This behavior happened on several occasions over the next few years,\u201d the pastor said in his statement. Morris\u2019 behavior was \u201cbrought to light\u201d in 1987 while he was a pastor at Shady Grove Church in Grand Prairie, which has since become one of Gateway Church\u2019s 11 locations, WFAA reported. \u201cIn March of 1987,\u00a0this situation was brought to light, and\u00a0it was confessed and repented of. I submitted myself to the Elders of Shady Grove Church and the young lady\u2019s father. They asked me to step out of ministry and receive counseling and freedom ministry, which I did. Since that time, I have walked in purity and accountability in this area,\u201d Morris said in his statement, adding he and his wife met with the survivor and her family in 1989. \u201cI asked their forgiveness, and they graciously forgave me,\u201d he said. Clemishire told WFAA that though her family forgave him, they never supported Morris returning to the ministry. \u201cI think leaders can get caught up and think it\u2019s our responsibility to protect God and it\u2019s not. Our responsibility is to protect the people,\u201d she added. \u201cGod is bigger than all of that.\u201d CNN has sought comment from, Morris and Gateway Church, as well as Clemishire and her attorney. In a statement to WFAA, Gateway Church said Morris underwent a two-year \u201crestoration process\u201d after a \u201cmoral failure\u201d in his twenties. \u201cPastor Robert has been open and forthright about a moral failure he had over 35 years ago when he was in his twenties and prior to him starting Gateway Church. He has shared publicly from the pulpit the proper Biblical steps he took in his lengthy restoration process,\u201d the church\u2019s statement said. \u201cThe two-year restoration process was closely administered by the Elders at Shady Grove Church and included him stepping out of the ministry during that period while receiving professional counseling and freedom ministry counseling,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cSince the resolution of the 35-year-old matter, there have been no other moral failures.\u201d In 2016, Morris was part of Trump\u2019s Evangelical Executive Advisory Board, the campaign announced in a\u00a0news release at the time. Trump also held a\u00a0roundtable at Gateway\u2019s Dallas campus in 2020 and Morris led a prayer before the event. Morris does not have a role with the 2024 campaign, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told CNN. Morris\u2019 son,\u00a0James Morris, will take over senior pastor\u00a0duties in 2025 with the elder Morris remaining a primary speaker on weekends, according to\u00a0the church\u2019s website.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/us/robert-morris-gateway-church-sexual-abuse-allegations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_us_rochester-hills-michigan-splash-pad-shooting", "text": "A suspect in the shooting that injured at least nine people at a recreation area in Rochester Hills, Michigan, Saturday was found dead at a nearby home, Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said. The suspect, a 42-year-old man whose name has not yet been released, was found at a nearby home after police tracked the weapon from the shooting scene to the address about a half mile from the crime scene, the sheriff said at a news conference Saturday night. \u201cIn my worst nightmare, I couldn\u2019t imagine standing up here again talking about another active shooter,\u201d Bouchard said at a news conference Saturday evening. It appears the suspect had pulled up to the recreation area at Brooklands Plaza Splash Pad in Rochester Hills, exited a vehicle and opened fire roughly 20 feet away, reloading multiple times, Bouchard said. The suspect fired \u201cpotentially 28 times,\u201d the sheriff said. The incident appears to be random and authorities have yet to determine a motivation for the attack, he added. At least two of the victims are children, authorities said. One of the victims, an 8-year-old boy, sustained a gunshot wound to the head and is in critical condition, Bouchard said. A 4-year-old had a wound to the thigh and is in stable condition, he said. Their 39-year-old mother with wounds to the abdomen and leg was also in critical condition. Six other gunshot victims, including three women and three men from 30 to 78 years old, were in stable condition. Rochester Hills is about 27 miles north of Detroit. Authorities initially provided conflicting numbers on how many people were shot as hospitals began reporting gunshot victims showing up for treatment. The sheriff later confirmed at least nine were shot, including the mother and her two sons and a husband and wife. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced in a statement on X she is in contact with local officials following the shooting.  \u201cI am heartbroken to learn about the shooting in Rochester Hills,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe are monitoring the situation as updates continue to come in, and are in touch with local officials.\u201d \u201cThis is a great community and it\u2019s heartbreaking to see this happen here,\u201d said Rochester Hills Mayor Bryan Barnett. Weapon on scene leads authorities to nearby home The first 911 call alerting police to the incident was made around 5:11 p.m. Bouchard said a Rochester Hills sergeant was listening to a new technology that securely livestreams 911 calls directly to first responders and responded to the scene within two minutes, before the call was dispatched. The suspect had already left the scene and authorities located a handgun and three empty magazines at the scene. \u201cThe one weapon on scene led us to the address that was registered to that address, which is why we got so quickly to the home,\u201d Bouchard said Saturday night. After making attempts to contact the suspect, law enforcement \u201cbreached the home and deployed drones to begin an examination of the home,\u201d and were able to locate the deceased suspect, the sheriff said. \u201cWe brought in assets including our SWAT, our helicopter, our drones and tried to make contact with the person, tried to bring that person out peacefully and to no avail, had no contact back,\u201d Bouchard said at a news conference Saturday evening. A drone that flew into the home while police surrounded it also found what appeared to be an \u201cAR-platform\u201d firearm on the kitchen table, Bouchard said Saturday night. As deputies surrounded the house, the sheriff advised those sheltering in the parks to go home and asked people to stay away from the area if they are sheltering at a nearby location. The suspect was not known to authorities until they did a \u201cquick investigation\u201d and determined who they believed was involved based on evidence from the crime scene. \u201cA vehicle that matched what had been described as a vehicle leaving the scene was there,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cWe put up a quick perimeter and deputies on scene apparently heard or saw the individual they are trying to communicate with.\u201d Investigators believe there are potentially more weapons in the home but it is unclear if the suspect has access to them, according to Bouchard. The sheriff called the incident a \u201cgut punch,\u201d and stressed the community is still reeling from the 2021 shooting at a high school in Oxford, located 15 miles north of Rochester Hills, when four students were killed. \u201cWe\u2019re not even fully comprehending what happened at Oxford, and now we have another complete tragedy that we\u2019re dealing with,\u201d he said. CNN has reached out to the Oakland County Sheriff\u2019s Office for more information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/us/rochester-hills-michigan-splash-pad-shooting/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "us"}}
