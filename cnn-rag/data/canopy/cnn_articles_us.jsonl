Baldwin\u2019s attorneys had accused prosecutors of misconduct during the grand jury process and sought to have the case dismissed. In January, Baldwin pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the shooting. Hutchins was fatally shot and director Joel Souza was injured after a gun Baldwin was holding discharged a live round during a scene rehearsal on the New Mexico set of the western movie. It was the second time the actor pleaded not guilty to charges related to the shooting. Involuntary manslaughter charges were dropped against Baldwin in 2023, with prosecutors saying in a statement at the time that they could not \u201cproceed under the current time constraints and on the facts and evidence turned over by law enforcement in its existing form\u201d due to \u201cnew facts\u201d in the case. He was charged for a second time and indicted in January. Baldwin\u2019s lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the indictment in March. They accused prosecutors of engaging in misconduct and said prosecutors \u201cpublicly dragged Baldwin through the cesspool created by their improprieties \u2013 without any regard for the fact that serious criminal charges have been hanging over his head for two and a half years.\u201d Baldwin\u2019s lawyers claimed the prosecution presented false and inaccurate testimony to the grand jury, withheld exculpatory evidence from the grand jury, and gave them improper and prejudicial instructions. In response to Baldwin\u2019s team\u2019s March motion to dismiss the indictment, special prosecutors in New Mexico defended their case, saying Baldwin\u2019s behavior on the \u201cRust\u201d movie set contributed to \u201csafety compromises\u201d that led to the fatal shooting. In the order to deny Baldwin\u2019s motion to dismiss, the judge said despite the defense\u2019s claims,there was no prosecutorial bad faith, as Baldwin\u2019s legal team had claimed, and proper procedures were followed in the grand jury process. In the ruling, the judge said \u201cafter review of transcripts from the January 18, 2024 and January 19, 2024 grand jury presentations, the Court does not find that the \u2018prosecuting attorney assisting the grand jury\u2019 engaged in \u2018intentional misconduct\u2019 reflecting \u2018dishonesty of belief, purpose, or motive\u2019 in the course of the attorney\u2019s \u2018presentation of evidence to the grand jury.\u2019\u201d The film\u2019s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez Reed, who was responsible for firearm safety and storage on the movie\u2019s set, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in March. She was sentenced in April to 18 months in prison and is appealing. In a short statement to CNN following a judge\u2019s refusal to dismiss charges against Baldwin, Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro from the actor\u2019s legal team said: \u201cWe look forward to our day in court.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/us/alec-baldwin-rust-shooting-case/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_23_us_unc-dei-policy-vote-reaj", "text": "The Board of Governors for the University of North Carolina System  voted Thursday to repeal and replace its existing diversity and inclusion policy that applies to the 17 schools the board oversees. The new policy reverses one that was adopted in 2019 that sought to \u201cfoster an inclusive environment\u201d\u00a0and required each school to submit diversity and inclusion reports to the board of trustees every year. The new policy now requires UNC schools to \u201censure equality of all persons & viewpoints,\u201d and promote \u201cnondiscrimination in employment practices.\u201d It also mandates that all UNC schools comply with a series of amendments passed by the North Carolina General Assembly in the past year that limit what can be discussed or taught about race, racism and sex in government institutions. The policy passed with two board members \u2013 Joel Ford and Sonja Phillips Nichols \u2013 voting no. Both Ford and Nichols are Black. As the meeting convened, dozens of protestors gathered outside to rally against the proposed changes to the DEI policy. Andy Wallace, director of media relations for the UNC system, confirmed to CNN that two people were arrested outside the meeting Thursday morning. Ahead of the vote, board secretary Pearl Burris-Floyd and board member Gene Davis discussed their support for the new policy. Burris-Floyd said she retired from the field of DEI and believes there have been flaws in the way DEI has been taught. \u201cAnd that has hurt the fabric and ability to carry things forward, but it does not mean that we stop,\u201d Burris-Floyd said. The new policy, she said, will \u201cmake that path forward clearer for all people.\u201d Davis acknowledged that DEI has helped marginalized groups feel more welcomed on campus and ensures that schools are reflection of the state\u2019s diversity. Still, Davis said he had concerns. \u201cI have been made aware of things that have been done in the name of DEI that make me uncomfortable and that I believe actually result in our university communities being less welcoming to all,\u201d Davis said. He did not provide examples of the instances that made him \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d Davis said the commitments in the new policy are \u201cheartfelt by the members of this board and by the university leadership.\u201d But some students felt outraged over the board\u2019s decision, and what it signals for the future of diversity and inclusion in the UNC system. Pragya Upreti, a rising junior at UNC Chapel Hill, told CNN she attended the student press conference, as well as the protest outside the UNC Board of Governors meeting on Thursday morning. She told CNN she believes the decision to repeal the DEI policy sends a message that the board doesn\u2019t value Black and brown students. \u201cTruly this administration has failed us, and it will continue to fail generations of students who saw opportunity in diversity, equity, and inclusion,\u201d Upreti said. Chantal Stevens, executive director of the ACLU of North Carolina, called the Board\u2019s vote \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d in a statement and she asked the board to reconsider. \u201cOur university campuses must be environments where students feel included and are able to fully engage academically, and DEI programs serve an important role in achieving this,\u201d Stevens wrote in the statement. \u201cPulling funding from these programs undermines these efforts and sends a worrying message about how committed our universities are to protecting the rights of students to be free from discrimination on the basis of their\u00a0race, ethnicity, disability, or other protected classes.\u201d The vote by the 24-member UNC System Board Thursday comes as diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at public universities and corporations across the country are facing a string of attacks from critics and conservative lawmakers. The new policy follows similar moves by state governments in Florida and Texas to ban DEI efforts from public colleges and universities. Schools in the UNC System are required to comply with the new policy by September 1. The proposal does not indicate how many DEI jobs might be impacted. Earlier this month, the Board of Trustees for the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill\u00a0passed a separate proposal to divert $2.3 million from DEI programs to public safety. One trustee pointed to recent protests on campus as part of the reason the Board voted to advance the proposal to shift funding to public safety measures. \u201cWe talk about peaceful protest, but when you destroy property, or you take down the US flag, and you have to put up gates around it costs money, or deploy officers to do that,\u201d Marty Kotis the vice chair of the board\u2019s budget and finance committee said. \u201cNorth Carolinians are watching all of this and they are not happy. And\u00a0[I] think it\u2019s imperative that we have the proper resources for our law enforcement to protect the campus, and that means our property and that means our flag as well.\u201d Major universities including the University of Florida and University of Texas at Austin have been forced to dismantle their DEI offices and programs and cut jobs to comply with state laws and regulations. Since 2023, 14\u00a0anti-DEI bills that\u00a0target programs at colleges have been signed into law,\u00a0according to a tally by the Chronicle of Higher\u00a0Education. North Carolina lawmakers passed a bill last year that bans diversity statements from state agencies, the University of North Carolina system, and community colleges. \u2018You will be able to feel the difference\u2019 The anti-DEI proposals at both the system-wide level and UNC at Chapel Hill\u2019s campus have left students worried about the future of diversity programs on campus if they are enacted. Ahead of the meeting, UNC System students gathered in Raleigh to speak out against the proposed changes.\u00a0 \u201cTo gut the DEI policy is to deny students both present and future of their right to a high-quality education,\u201d one student said, according to CNN affiliate WRAL. \u201cDiversity and equity and inclusion are foundational to education.\u201d\u00a0 Another student said she attends UNC Ashville and is concerned that enrollment will decline at UNC System schools because DEI programs are banned.\u00a0 \u201cPassing this anti-DEI policy will be a kiss of death for some of these systems and institutions,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd will be monumentally detrimental to future student interest to apply for and much less attend these UNC System Schools\u2026. We will all suffer.\u201d Toby Posel, co-policy chair for UNC Chapel Hill\u2019s Affirmative Action Coalition and a co-founder of the student organization TransparUNCy, said he was \u201cextremely disgusted and disappointed\u201d at both the UNC System and UNC board members for going against DEI. Posel said he is\u00a0concerned that the UNC system\u2019s anti-DEI policy leaves room for interpretation and it is unknown how jobs, programs and offices might be impacted. But regardless, Posel said the absence of DEI will make the campuses unwelcoming for people of color, LGBTQ+ students and first-generation college students. \u201cYou will be able to feel the difference,\u201d Posel said. \u201cIt will be significantly less welcoming, less safe, less supportive. Their academic lives are going to suffer, social lives are going suffer. This is a very clear statement from the highest level of university governance in North Carolina that (they) don\u2019t care about those students.\u201d Julian Taylor, executive board member of the Affirmative Action Coalition and a co-founder of TransparUNCy,\u00a0said he believes both boards are taking a political stance against DEI that aligns with a conservative movement instead of being neutral. The UNC Board of Governors is made up of 24 members who are elected by the Republican-led North Carolina General Assembly. The UNC Chapel Hill Board of Trustees has 15 members, including eight elected by the Board of Governors, six appointed by the General Assembly and one spot for the president of student government. Taylor said DEI initiatives have allowed UNC Chapel Hill to reckon with its history of slavery on campus. He worries that cutting DEI programs will impact curriculum and prevent this history from being taught. \u201cDEI is a small step in serving racial justice,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut a lot of this is about the larger, overarching debate about what we do to try to rectify past injustices. And this is a pretty clear answer from UNC and the UNC Board of Trustees saying that the answer to that question is \u2018absolutely nothing.\u2019\u201d CNN\u2019s Devon M. Sayers and Dianne Gallagher contributed to this report. ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/us/unc-dei-policy-vote-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_26_us_missouri-daken-kramer-school-lunch-debt", "text": "Kids can now eat without breaking the piggy bank \u2013 at least, at Thomas Ultican Elementary School \u2013 thanks to fifth grader Daken Kramer. Daken paid off the entire meal debt and then some, for his elementary school in Blue Springs, Missouri, after turning in a check for more than $7,300. Daken\u2019s original goal was $3,500, which was just over\u00a0the total of the school\u2019s debt, according to Daken\u2019s mother, Vanessa Kramer. The remaining amount was given to Blue Springs High School, another school in the district. \u201cChildren in elementary school should not have debt tied to their name. We have found out that there are high schools that keep seniors from attending prom or walking at graduation if they have stuff like student lunch debt,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cSome families can\u2019t help it. They can\u2019t pay it off.\u201d In a video shared to his mom\u2019s Facebook, Daken had challenged \u201cfriends, family and local businesses to donate what they can to this cause.\u201d Upon Daken\u2019s request, Kramer reached out to Blue Springs School District to get information about the school\u2019s meal debt. Soon, the online fundraiser was spreading to states like Texas, Florida and New Jersey. Within a matter of two weeks, Daken\u2019s fundraiser more than doubled his goal. As of Daken\u2019s fifth grade graduation on Tuesday, the Daken Kramer Legacy Award will now be an annual honor for fifth graders striving to make their own mark. \u201cYour selfless actions will impact dozens of students throughout the district,\u201d Kristi Haley, Daken\u2019s teacher, said as she announced the award in his name. \u201cIt\u2019s not the amount of money you raised, although that was absolutely incredible. It\u2019s your heart, your drive, your determination and your grit to help others that inspires us.\u201d Daken said the award took him aback. \u201cIt was definitely a surprise. I had no idea that they were going to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I definitely started to feel a lot of emotions.\u201d A lunch for an elementary schooler in the Blue Springs School District is $2.55 \u2013 with the reduced price being 40 cents for students in need, according to the district. About 29% of the roughly 15,000 students enrolled in the Blue Springs School District are eligible for a free or reduced lunch, district spokesperson Katie Woolf told CNN Thursday. While Daken\u2019s fundraiser cleared his school\u2019s meal debt, the Blue Springs School District meal debt totals to more than $235,000, according to Woolf. The district includes 20 schools at varying levels. The School Nutrition Association reported among the school districts represented by their members \u2013 about one-fifth of US school districts nationwide \u2013 meal debt ranged from $10 to approximately $1 million, according to the school nutrition directors who are members of their organization and who responded to the association\u2019s 2024 survey. The association collected this data as a part of their lobbying effort to try to get more funding for school meal programs. In November 2023, the median reported district meal debt was about $5,495 among districts represented by members who responded to the survey, which was up from about $5,164 in the survey a year prior, according to the association. Hoping to bring wider attention to the issue of school meal debt, Kramer says she and Daken are now working with a Missouri state representative to see if they can take their efforts to the next level. Seeing the droves of people who reached out with support showed Kramer how one person can make a difference, she said. \u201cEven though this is something that kids don\u2019t need to worry about and don\u2019t have any responsibility (for), I\u2019m very, very proud as his mom that he is mature enough to see that there is an issue and if the people who have the power to make a change won\u2019t change anything, then he will step up and make a change,\u201d she said. Daken, whose favorite school lunch is an orange chicken and rice bowl, says kids don\u2019t have to do extraordinary things to be the next recipient of the Daken Kramer Legacy Award. \u201cThey don\u2019t really need to do anything big to get the award,\u201d Daken said. \u201cIt\u2019s only if they really care about it and they are really, really compassionate about helping the school.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/us/missouri-daken-kramer-school-lunch-debt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_26_us_alexander-williams-wrongful-execution-lawsuit-reaj", "text": "For 85 years Susie Williams Carter believed her brother was guilty of the crime he\u2019d been convicted of and executed for: A brutal murder of a White woman at a Pennsylvania youth detention center. In 1931, Alexander McClay Williams became the youngest person to be executed in Pennsylvania, when his death sentence was carried out by electric chair at the age of 16. Alexander was convicted of murdering Vida Robare, the matron\u00a0at the Glen Mills School, a\u00a0youth detention facility where he was housed located just outside of Philadelphia. Carter, who was a year old at the time of her brother\u2019s execution, told CNN her family rarely discussed Alexander as it was painful for her mother and father to relive the anguish and heartbreak of his execution. But in 2015, all that changed. That\u2019s when Carter, the only living sibling of the family of 13 children, was presented with evidence that shifted an image she held of her brother\u00a0for decades. Now, more than 90 years after his execution, Carter and her family\u00a0are suing the county for damages, alleging that Alexander was \u201cimproperly arrested and subjected to the horrors of imprisonment, unfairly tried, wrongfully convicted and ultimately executed in the electric chair for a crime he did not commit,\u201d according to the lawsuit filed last week in the district court for eastern Pennsylvania. CNN has reached out to the district attorney\u2019s office for comment on the lawsuit. Carter, who is 94,\u00a0told CNN she wants to raise awareness that wrongful convictions continue to plague young\u00a0people of color across the US.  \u201cI want them (the public) to realize that these things are still going on,\u201d Carter said. \u201cSomething should be done to stop it.\u201d \u2018They made no effort to hide what they did\u2019 On Oct. 3, 1930, Robare\u2019s body was discovered by her ex-husband Fred, who also worked at the Glen Mills School, according to the\u00a0complaint. She \u201chad been stabbed 47 times with an ice pick and suffered two broken ribs and a skull fracture,\u201d according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit that maintains an extensive database on capital punishment cases in the United States. \u00a0\u00a0A local newspaper, The Chester Times, \u201creported that district attorneys and detectives had reviewed the ranks of Glenn Mills\u2019 students and decided to question\u201d Alexander, according to the complaint. It\u2019s unclear why he was singled out from the group. William Ridley, the first African American admitted to the Bar of Delaware County, represented Alexander at trial. \u00a0His great-grandson, Sam Lemon, told CNN he\u2019s been enthralled by Ridley\u2019s trailblazing career since he was a child. So much so, he lives in Ridley\u2019s home in Media, Pennsylvania, about 20 miles outside of Philadelphia. \u201cI wanted to know, why did he (Ridley) lose probably the most important law case of his entire legal career?\u201d Lemon said. \u201cIt was a little bit of a debt of honor, trying to figure out why that was and (find) some way to see if I could explain that to the Williams family or make that better.\u201d So, in 1989 Lemon began writing letters, collecting documentation and visiting the Philadelphia Historical Society to view archival records about the case. He\u00a0acquired death certificates and digested genealogy through ancestry archives \u2013 all to better understand how Alexander was convicted.  As he researched, Lemon found the 1930 death certificate from the prison doctor and, he said, it appeared someone had altered the boy\u2019s age to make it read that he was 18 years old when he was, in fact, 16. \u201cBut they forgot to change the birth year to make the math work,\u201d Lemon said. Lemon said he also noticed it listed the day she died as Oct. 3 and an autopsy was completed the following day. Robare\u2019s cause of death was written in black ink: \u201cpuncture wounds of the heart,\u201d a document in the family\u2019s complaint shows. But somebody, in what appears to be different handwriting, wrote \u201ccaused by ice pick in the hands of Alexander McClay Williams\u201d in blue ink, Lemon said. But Alexander hadn\u2019t been convicted yet.\u00a0The complaint notes this discrepancy as well. Reading over the document made him nauseous, Lemon said. \u201cIt made me physically ill; I thought I was gonna have to reach for a trash can,\u201d he said. There weren\u2019t any eyewitnesses to the crime or physical or forensic evidence that connected Alexander with the murder, the complaint states. An\u00a0adult\u2019s\u00a0bloody handprint was found at the murder scene, but\u00a0that evidence was not introduced at trial and an officer later testified that he did not observe any blood on Alexander, according to the complaint.  But, Lemon said, it wasn\u2019t until he reviewed the original 300-page transcript from the trial that all the pieces fell into place. \u201cWhen I read that, it was just stunning,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cBut what really astonished me was, they made no effort to hide what they did.\u201d On the day of the murder, a school officer asked Alexander and another boy to get shovels that were \u201clocated between one and two blocks away.\u201d He then asked Alexander run a separate errand \u2013 a task that the officer said took the boy 20 minutes to complete, according to the complaint. At trial, the Commonwealth argued that within those 20 minutes, Alexander committed the murder, according to the complaint. Lemon said when he outlined all\u00a0the teen was accused of doing within that short time frame he counted 15 separate actions. \u201cThat\u2019s when I hit this eureka moment that this was impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I started doing\u00a0these walking tests, time trials around my hometown in Media and I measured distances with my car and a stopwatch, and it came to me that it was just impossible. It was impossible for him to do all these things in 20 minutes and then go back to work without any blood on him whatsoever.\u201d After two decades of research, Lemon decided he had collected enough information to present his findings to Carter and her family. He prepared a 45-minute PowerPoint presentation for the Williams family, who listened politely and quietly in the living room of a family home, he said, as he revealed why he believed Alexander was wrongfully convicted. \u201cThey were kind of stunned because they didn\u2019t know about this stuff,\u201d Lemon said. Lemon made a promise to Carter and her family that he was going to help them clear Alexander\u2019s name. \u201cThere was a lot of shame associated with the family in addition to kind of having to suffer in silence,\u201d Lemon said. \u201cI feel honored that these people took this stranger out of the blue and trusted me, talking about probably the most important family memory that they had and an extremely painful one at that.\u201d \u2018We cannot undo the past\u2019 It took more than two weeks for Alexander to be appointed an attorney, during which time he was interrogated at least five times \u201cwithout the benefit of an attorney or parent present,\u201d according to the complaint. Alexander initially denied involvement\u00a0but eventually\u00a0\u201cconfessed\u201d to the crime\u00a0three times,\u00a0but the complaint alleges the confessions were coerced. At trial, Alexander \u201cfaced an all-White jury, which found him guilty in less than four hours,\u201d according to a 2022 statement from the county\u2019s district attorney\u2019s office. In 2017, the case against Alexander Williams was reopened\u00a0thanks to the legal advocacy from Lemon and attorney Robert Keller, who posthumously represented the teen in court proceedings as Lemon and the family sought to overturn his conviction. In June 2022,\u00a0a judge from the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas\u00a0ordered a retrial\u00a0and the Delaware County District Attorney\u2019s office declined to bring the case. The case was dismissed in, \u201can acknowledgement that the charges against him should never have been brought,\u201d according to the statement from the district attorney\u2019s office at the time. \u201cSadly, we cannot undo the past,\u201d District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer said in the statement. \u201cWe cannot rewrite history to erase the egregious wrongs of our forebearers. However, when, as here, justice can be served by publicly acknowledging such a wrong, we must seize that opportunity.\u201d In October 2022 \u2013 more than 90 years after he was sentenced to death \u2013 Alexander was exonerated by then-Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. More than 150 people were exonerated in the US in 2023. Of those, nearly 84% were people of color, nearly 61% of the exonerees were Black and the most frequent factor in the exonerations\u00a0was official misconduct, according to data from The National Registry of Exonerations. The Emmett Till Legacy Foundation, which honors the memory of the 14-year-old Black teen who was\u00a0kidnapped, brutally beaten and\u00a0murdered in 1955\u00a0by two White men\u00a0after he was accused of assaulting a White woman,\u00a0offered a statement of support to the Williams family, saying they are inspired by their \u201clong and overdue quest for truth, justice and accountability.\u201d \u201cNo family should endure the type of historical and generational trauma that their family, ours and so many others have experienced for this long,\u201d the statement said. \u201cUnfortunately, it is a continuous throughline of injustice, across this country that still impacts us today.\u201d Carter said she has continued to\u00a0fight to clear her brother\u2019s name \u2013 even after all this time \u2013 because she wants to raise awareness that what happened to him, continues to happen to others. She imagined her parents sitting through her brother\u2019s trial with great difficulty, hearing about the things Alexander was accused of doing, knowing that their son was innocent. \u201cAnd yet (the commonwealth) let him die,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a terrible thing to do a family.\u201d CNN\u2019s Justin Gamble contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_25_us_harrison-butker-speech-response", "text": "In his first public comments following a controversial speech at a recent college commencement, Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker defended his address and emphasized his Catholic faith. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t clear that the timeless Catholic values are hated by many, it is now,\u201d Butker said during a speech at the \u201cCourage Under Fire\u201d gala in Nashville on Friday night. The Nashville speech was\u00a0posted to X by right-wing media outlet The Daily Wire. This is the first time the three-time Super Bowl champion\u00a0has spoken publicly about his commencement address at Benedictine College, a small Catholic college in Kansas, on May 11. During his address, Butker made comments interpreted by many as homophobic and sexist, including calling Pride Month a \u201cdeadly sin\u201d and saying that a woman\u2019s accomplishments in the home are more valuable than any academic or professional goals, among other things. Friday night\u2019s gala was hosted by\u00a0Regina Caeli Academy \u2013 a hybrid campus/homeschool Catholic school group with several locations across the country. The gala boasted several other speakers including right-wing media personality and host at the Daily Wire, Matt Walsh. \u201cOver the past few days, my beliefs, or what people think I believe, have been the focus of countless discussions around the globe,\u201d Butker, who is on the school\u2019s\u00a0board of directors, said. Regina Caeli Academy\u00a0did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. \u201cAt the outset, many people expressed a shocking level of hate. But as the days went on, even those who disagreed with my viewpoints shared their support for my freedom of religion,\u201d Butker said Friday. Butker reaffirmed his commitment to his Catholic faith, saying, \u201cOur love for Jesus and thus our desire to speak out should never be outweighed by the longing of our fallen nature to be loved by the world.\u201d During his speech, Butker referred to Saint Daniel, the biblical prophet who was thrown into a lion\u2019s den for committing to prayer to God, despite a law that condemned worshipers to death. \u201cI can\u2019t help but tremble at the thought of the courage many saints have shown in their lives,\u201d Butker said. Daniel was spared by God due to his commitment to faith, according to the Old Testament. \u201cWould I be so bold if the repercussion was what Daniel faced in being fed to lions? In reality, any courage I\u2019ve shown will lead to some small suffering. And it will lead to some people maybe never liking me, but that could be God\u2019s will,\u201d the Chiefs kicker said. The NFL issued a statement earlier this month, saying Butker\u2019s comments don\u2019t reflect the views of the league. Butker\u2019s May 11 speech sparked criticism from LGBT advocacy organization GLAAD, which called his comments \u201ca clear miss\u201d and \u201cwoefully out of step with Americans about Pride, LGBTQ people and women.\u201d The sisters of Mount St. Scholastica monastery, a\u00a0founding institution\u00a0and sponsor of Benedictine College, also distanced themselves from Butker\u2019s message. \u201cThe sisters of Mount St. Scholastica do not believe that Harrison Butker\u2019s comments in his 2024 Benedictine College commencement address represent the Catholic, Benedictine, liberal arts college that our founders envisioned and in which we have been so invested,\u201d they said\u00a0in a statement. \u201cInstead of promoting unity in our church, our nation, and the world, his comments seem to have fostered division.\u201d Fellow Chiefs star, Travis Kelce, recently responded to the commencement address, saying\u00a0he does not agree with \u201cjust about any\u201d of Butker\u2019s views but values him as a teammate. \u201cI cherish him as a teammate. I think Pat (Mahomes) said it best where he is every bit of a great person and a great teammate,\u201d\u00a0Kelce said on the latest episode of the \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast he hosts with his brother, Jason.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/us/harrison-butker-speech-response/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_us_braintree-massachusetts-amc-movie-theater-stabbing", "text": "A suspect accused of stabbing a man through a McDonald\u2019s drive-through window and then stabbing a woman inside the restaurant was arrested last month on suspicion of assaulting a family member, court records show. Massachusetts police are also investigating whether the assailant at the McDonald\u2019s in Plymouth also stabbed four girls between ages 9 and 17 about an hour earlier at a movie theater in Braintree. Jared Ravizza, 26, is the suspect in \u201cmultiple South Shore stabbing incidents,\u201d the Plymouth County District Attorney\u2019s Office said, though no details were given for the other incidents. Braintree police have said it \u201cappears as though\u201d the attacks at the movie theater and the McDonald\u2019s are related. Ravizza was arrested and faces charges of assault with intent to murder and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon in connection with the attack at McDonald\u2019s. The suspect is expected to appear in\u00a0court Tuesday, and it was not immediately clear Monday whether Ravizza had an attorney. Last month, Ravizza was arrested on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, accused of assault and battery of a family member and vandalism, according to records at Edgartown District Court. Records show that case has not been adjudicated. Ravizza\u2019s father told officers Jared \u201chad just had a mental break and attacked him\u201d inside his home, The Boston Globe reported, citing a police report on file with the court. The report also said Ravizza allegedly wrecked the father\u2019s home office, according to The Boston Globe. Ravizza was sent to Martha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital for a mental health evaluation, but \u201cdid not meet their standards to be held,\u201d the Boston Globe reported, citing the report. How the weekend stabbings unfolded The first attack happened around 6 p.m. Saturday at an AMC movie theater in Braintree. \u201cWithout saying anything and without any warning, (the assailant) suddenly attacked and stabbed the four young females,\u201d police said. \u201cThe attack appeared to be unprovoked. After the attack, the (suspect) ran out of the theater and left in a vehicle.\u201d The girls were taken to Boston hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries, Braintree police said. The theater was put on lockdown shortly after the incident, an AMC employee told CNN. The suspect fled the theater in what appeared to be a black SUV, and video footage allowed authorities to capture its license plate, authorities said. A vehicle matching the description was \u201creportedly involved in (a) similar assault in Plymouth,\u201d about 25 miles southeast of Braintree, police said. About an hour after the movie theater stabbings, a 21-year-old woman and a 29-year-old man were stabbed at the McDonald\u2019s in Plymouth. Ravizza allegedly arrived at the scene of the Plymouth McDonald\u2019s in a black Porsche Macan SUV, prosecutors said. Surveillance footage from the McDonald\u2019s appears to show Ravizza reach through the drive-through window and stab the male victim with a large knife, prosecutors said. Video then shows the suspect park the car, enter the restaurant and stab the female victim before fleeing in the car, the district attorney\u2019s office said. Both victims from the McDonald\u2019s attack were taken to hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries, officials said. Minutes after the McDonald\u2019s stabbings, state troopers located the suspect\u2019s car and tried to pull it over, authorities said. But the driver failed to stop, and a chase ensued. The suspect\u2019s vehicle eventually crashed in Sandwich, about a 25-minute drive south of Plymouth, police said. Ravizza was being treated for non-life-threatening injuries at a hospital Sunday, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. While Ravizza faces assault charges in connection with the McDonald\u2019s attack, \u201cPreliminary investigation suggests a likely connection to an earlier incident at a movie theater in Braintree resulting in non-life threatening injuries to four juveniles,\u201d state police said. It was not immediately clear whether Ravizza has an attorney. CNN has sought more information from Massachusetts State Police,\u00a0the Plymouth County District Attorney\u2019s Office and the Braintree Police Department. Massachusetts State Police said the investigation is ongoing. Investigators probe another possible link Aside from the Massachusetts stabbings, Connecticut State Police said a suspect linked to a death in the town of Deep River had been taken into custody in Massachusetts. But police in neither state have confirmed whether the Connecticut case is connected to the stabbings in Massachusetts. Connecticut State Police said they responded Saturday afternoon to a \u201cdisturbance\u201d at an address in Deep River. There, police found a \u201cdeceased individual\u201d whose identity has not been confirmed, Connecticut State Police said. \u201cA suspect in this investigation has been taken into custody in the State of Massachusetts and there is no active threat to the public,\u201d Connecticut police said. Authorities did not name that suspect. CNN\u2019s Celina Tebor, Paradise Afshar, Samantha Beech, Artemis Moshtaghian, Caroll Alvarado and Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.

The legislation passed in the then-Democratically controlled House in June 2020. But it stalled in the Senate. Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee reintroduced the bill on Thursday, days before the fourth anniversary of Floyd\u2019s murder.\u00a0It calls for law enforcement to be held\u00a0\u201caccountable for misconduct in court,\u201d and police training and policy reforms. \u201cWe have the opportunity to enact bold, comprehensive reform to policing practices, to correct and prevent unnecessary deaths.

Philonise Floyd agreed. \u201cIn their mind they (police) are looking at you as a target just because you\u2019re somebody of color,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, if they can make federal laws to protect the bird, which is the bald eagle, then they can make federal laws to protect people of color.\u201d George Floyd,\u00a0a 46-year-old Black man, was killed on May 25, 2020, while in police custody.

The following year, Chauvin was\u00a0convicted\u00a0of murder and manslaughter in a state trial and sentenced to\u00a0more than 22 years\u00a0in prison. He later\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in federal court of depriving Floyd of his civil rights. Three other former Minneapolis police officers also faced state and federal charges and were sentenced to prison time for their role in Floyd\u2019s murder.

{"id": "2024_05_23_us_marilyn-mosby-baltimore-sentencing", "text": "A federal judge has sentenced Baltimore\u2019s former top prosecutor Marilyn Mosby to time served and 12 months of home confinement \u2013 to be served concurrently with 3 years of supervised release \u2013 for mortgage fraud and perjury. In addition, Mosby was ordered to complete 100 hours of community service, according to the judgment. Mosby, who gained national prominence for charging six police officers in connection with the 2015 death of Freddie Gray in a police van, was convicted in two trials of making a false mortgage application and perjury. US prosecutors had asked the court to sentence Mosby, 44, to 20 months in prison, followed by a supervised release, according to a May 9 sentencing memorandum. That sentence, the memo says, would \u201cmake clear that those who break the law, including those in positions of public trust, will be held accountable.\u201d Mosby has claimed she is innocent and the charges against her are politically motivated. Her attorneys\u00a0argued in a May 16 response she \u201chas been punished enough,\u201d asking for a sentence of time served with one year of supervised release. US District Court Judge Lydia Griggsby said she took into account that two juries found Mosby did something wrong and \u201cbreached a public trust,\u201d according to CNN affiliate WBAL-TV, which had a reporter in court. The judge also said the fact that Mosby is a mother of two weighed heavily on the court, according to the news station. In addition to Thursday\u2019s sentence, Griggsby ordered Mosby to forfeit 90% of her interests in the Longboat Key, Florida, condo connected to her conviction on making a false mortgage application. A preliminary order filed Thursday authorized the government to seize the property. Once sold, Mosby could receive up to $47,600 plus 10% of the home\u2019s appreciation value. Mosby walked out of court with her two daughters and alongside a group of supporters, including civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who chanted, \u201cJustice for Marilyn.\u201d Mosby told the crowd she was \u201ceternally grateful\u201d for all her supporters and advocates. \u201cThis is not over,\u201d she said. \u201cBut God was here today and I know he\u2019s with me, he touched the heart of this judge and has allowed me to go home to my babies.\u201d In a statement sent to CNN after the sentencing, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Maryland said, \u201cAs always, we respect the judgment of the court.\u201d Where the convictions stem from Mosby\u2019s trials, convictions and sentence mark\u00a0a remarkable undoing for a prosecutor who took office just months before\u00a0Gray died\u00a0from spinal injuries suffered while in police custody in the back of a van. Three officers were acquitted, leading Mosby to\u00a0drop the charges\u00a0against the rest. Her\u00a0sentencing follows Mosby\u2019s conviction on three charges across two trials. Mosby was first found guilty in November of two counts of perjury after prosecutors accused her of falsely claiming in 2020 she experienced \u201cadverse financial consequences\u201d as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic to withdraw $90,000 in retirement funds. At the time, she earned a gross salary of $247,955.58, the indictment said, and her pay was never reduced. Mosby then was found guilty in February of making a false mortgage application stemming from the purchase of a Florida condo, the Justice Department said. At trial, prosecutors presented evidence showing Mosby falsely stated she had gotten a $5,000 gift from her husband to be applied to the purchase of the property to get a lower interest rate. In fact, the Justice Department said, Mosby sent her husband $5,000, which he then transferred back to her. The jury in that trial acquitted Mosby of a second charge of making a false mortgage application stemming from the purchase of another Florida home.

Local emergency response service Haitian Emergency Response Operations (HERO) assisted in coordinating and managing the operation to retrieve the bodies and transport the remains of the American couple to a hospital morgue. \u201cCurrently, we are working to retrieve the bodies of Natalie and Davy,\u201d Baker said on social media Friday night, adding that the effort will involve obtaining a waiver. \u201cAfter that, we have to find an airline that will be willing to do the transport. Prayers that this will all go smoothly.\u201d He remembered the couple as people who put others before themselves, telling CNN Friday evening that he commends their bravery. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can find a better example of people who truly had a deep love for the people of Haiti and had a vision to help them in anyway that they could and made such an impact there among the different ministries they were involved in,\u201d Baker told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on \u201cThe Source.\u201d \u2018Our last call\u2019 David Lloyd told CNN that he was on the phone with his son during the attacks. The mission and church across the street have two security guards, but when the 23-year-old came out of the church around 6 p.m., \u201cthree pick-up trucks full of guys with guns overwhelmed them immediately,\u201d he said. The armed men dragged Davy Lloyd to the house, tied him up, and started looting the compound, according to his father, who said children from the orphanage were in the compound at the time. After the gang left with its haul, Davy Lloyd called his father. \u201cHe was injured, and he was hurt. He was nervous, and very very scared,\u201d David Lloyd said. \u201cHe was begging me to find someone to get in there and help him, and I did all I could but I couldn\u2019t locate anybody.\u201d Then more armed men arrived, he said. \u201cHe told me, \u2018I have to go down, something else is going down. I gotta go see what it is,\u2019\u201d David Lloyd recalled. \u201cThat was basically our last call.\u201d Around that time, someone shot one of the newly arrived gang members, sparking a violent backlash, he said. \u201cDavy went in and barricaded himself in my personal home with his wife and (mission director) Jude Montis. The gang shot that place up until they got the door busted down and shot them, and set Davy and Jude on fire.\u201d HERO, the ambulance service, confirmed to CNN that Davy Lloyd\u2019s body was found burned at the scene. Haitian police will work with international law enforcement to investigate the killings, police spokesperson Gary Desrosiers told CNN on Friday. \u201cThis is an open investigation but we are sure we will arrest those involved. For now, we\u2019re working on protecting the public and the community while actively searching for the perpetrators,\u201d he said. On Missions in Haiti\u2019s website, Davy Lloyd can be seen talking about growing up in the Caribbean nation and doing manual labor on the mission compound. He previously survived a kidnapping in Port-au-Prince in 2005, when he was just 5 years old, his father said. According to a report that year by the Tulsa World newspaper, Davy Lloyd, his sister and foster sister were abducted in a carjacking on their way home from school. But police were able to locate the kidnappers, rescue the children and quickly return them to their parents, according to the report. \u201cWe got them back 21 hours later,\u201d David Lloyd recalled. \u2018The security situation in Haiti cannot wait\u2019 In a statement to CNN Friday, the White House said it was aware of the reports and expressed condolences while urging for the expedited deployment of UN Security Council-approved international police force to the region. \u201cWe are aware of the reports of the deaths of U.S. citizens in Haiti.\u00a0Our hearts go out to the families of those killed as they experience unimaginable grief,\u201d a national security spokesperson told CNN. \u201cThe security situation in Haiti cannot wait. That is why yesterday, President Biden reiterated our commitment to support the expedited the deployment of the Multinational Security Support (MSS) Mission to bolster the Haitian National Police\u2019s capabilities to protect civilians, restore the rule of law, and pave the way to democratic governance.\u201d Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Parson also mourned the couple\u2019s loss on X Friday morning, calling it \u201cabsolutely heartbreaking news.\u201d Until now, the area around the Missions in Haiti compound had felt largely safe despite the violence in the rest of the city, according to David Lloyd, who was in the country until a few days ago. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really heard any gunshots in any of this. Our school\u2019s been open, the church has been functioning, the bakery\u2019s been selling bread every day,\u201d he said. When flights resumed last week to Port-au-Prince\u2019s Toussaint Louverture International Airport, Lloyd said he asked his son and daughter-in-law if they would like to leave Haiti, but they declined. \u201cWe know Haiti is a very volatile situation, we know that it\u2019s dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we had a good rapport with the groups in our area, and they\u2019d left us alone. But from what I understand this was an outside group that came in initially from about a mile away, that started it all.\u201d Natalie Lloyd\u2019s father told CNN the couple didn\u2019t leave even when they had the opportunity to do so because of the children they were taking care of. \u201cThey made the decision to remain even when it got worse because they felt like if they left, then those kids would have no where to go,\u201d Baker said on \u201cThe Source.\u201d He believes the initial gang attack was just intended as a robbery, with the gangs trying to take what they can before the UN\u2019s Multinational Security Support mission arrives. \u201cWe have a pretty large mission compound, lots of stuff. With the international military force that\u2019s supposed to be coming in any day, I think the gangs are trying to get all they can get because they realize their times may be coming to an end,\u201d he said. In a joint news conference with Kenyan President William Ruto on Thursday, Biden defended the decision not to deploy US troops to Haiti, telling reporters doing so\u00a0could raise \u201call kinds of questions that can be easily misrepresented by what we\u2019re trying to do, and be able to be used by those who disagree with us and against the interests of Haiti and the United States,\u201d while pointing to material support, including equipment and training, the US has already provided to address the crisis. The Facebook feed of\u00a0Missions in Haiti\u00a0has told the story of the increasing dire conditions in the country this year. \u201cThe gangs are still fighting for more control and chaos rules,\u201d the organization\u00a0posted\u00a0April 23. \u201cIt seems the world has turned their backs on Haiti and it is going to be left in complete gang control.\u201d This story and headline have been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_peter-strzok-lisa-page-fbi-settlement-doj", "text": "Former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page have reached a settlement with the Justice Department after they alleged their privacy rights were violated when their text messages were released and became political fodder for Donald Trump to oppose the Russia investigation during his presidency. The settlement, described as a \u201ctentative agreement\u201d in a court filing on Tuesday, will resolve in full the 5-year-old case Page brought against her former employer. She had sought financial damages of at least $1,000 for alleged privacy violations after her text messages critical of Trump were released to the media. Strzok, who was ultimately fired from the FBI, hasn\u2019t settled the portion of his lawsuit in which he sued for backpay and his job back, the filing said. The settlement has not yet been finalized or approved by a judge. Lawyers for Strzok and Page declined to comment or to provide further detail on the settlement. Strzok in his 2019 lawsuit had accused the Justice Department of wrongfully terminating him because of Trump\u2019s publicly stated anger toward him and the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\u00a0Strzok played a senior role on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team until he was removed after an internal investigation first revealed his texts with Page, with whom Strzok had an extramarital relationship, that could be read as exhibiting political bias. Page, who had also briefly served on Mueller\u2019s team, resigned from her role as a lawyer for the FBI after the messages were discovered. Page\u2019s suit alleged that \u201cDOJ and/or FBI officials\u201d provided the messages to reporters \u201cfor multiple improper reasons, including to elevate the DOJ\u2019s standing with the President.\u201d It claimed that journalists were brought to the Justice Department \u201cto review the messages at night, prohibiting the reporters from copying or removing the set of messages from the building, and instructing them not to reveal DOJ as the source.\u201d Echoing Page\u2019s suit, Strzok\u2019s lawyers added that the defendants \u201cshould not be heard to complain about the notoriety and putative damage to the FBI\u2019s reputation from Strzok\u2019s speech when it was their own illegal disclosures, magnified and distorted by the false attacks made by the President and his allies, that placed a spotlight on Strzok\u2019s opinions.\u201d The suits also led to Trump being deposed last year after a yearslong back and forth, with the Biden Justice Department seeking to shield Trump from giving the testimony, citing legal protections surrounding presidents and their actions while in office. Strzok\u2019s and Page\u2019s attorneys were able to ask Trump at the time about his public statements and other communications he made about the pair in 2017 and 2018.

I want to help even the match.\u201d French Gates, one of the world\u2019s wealthiest and most prominent philanthropists, resigned from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation earlier this month, announcing June 7 will be her last day at the organization she helped create more than two decades ago. As part of her divorce agreement, she received $12.5 billion from the Gates Foundation for her work upon her resignation, and she hinted she would focus her philanthropic efforts on women and girls \u2014 but she offered no specifics. Tuesday, she gave the first details of her new plan. French Gates said she will donate $1 billion through 2026 to advance women\u2019s rights around the world\u00a0through her organization, Pivotal Ventures. That will include $200 million in grants to organizations that are fighting for women\u2019s reproductive rights. Among those recipients is The 19th, a nonprofit news organization that reports on gender policy. \u201cPinch me,\u201d Emily Ramshaw, the company\u2019s co-founder and CEO, said in a post on X. \u201cSometimes dreams do come true,\u201d Ramshaw said in a blog post on the company\u2019s website. \u201cThis support will bolster our critical politics and policy coverage in a seismic election year, allow us to make strategic investments in our audiences and our future, and lay the foundation for our long-term sustainability in a turbulent time for our industry.\u201d Another recipient, The Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, said its grant will help advance its work to improve women\u2019s health across the United States and narrow the gender pay gap. \u201cWe are deeply honored to receive this support from Melinda French Gates, a true pioneer for women\u2019s empowerment,\u201d said Dr. Jamila Taylor, IWPR President and CEO, in a statement. French Gates will also give $250 million in awards to organizations working to help improve women\u2019s mental and physical health. In an innovative effort that echoes those by mega-philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, French Gates also said she will grant $240 million to a group of 12 advocates and influential leaders around the world ($20 million each) to allow them to give the money to groups they believe are performing urgent and meaningful work in women\u2019s health. Scott has shaken up the charitable world by shelling out large sums of money at rapid speed to organizations she favors \u2014 with no demands or strings attached. \u201cI\u2019m also experimenting with novel tactics to bring a wider range of perspectives into philanthropy,\u201d French Gates wrote in her op-ed. \u201cI\u2019m eager to see the landscape of funding opportunities through their eyes, and the results their approaches unlock.\u201d French Gates said the group of leaders includes former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, maternal-health advocate Allyson Felix and Afghan women\u2019s education activist Shabana Basij-Rasikh. In her op-ed, French Gates said she was once told to set her own agenda before someone else sets it \u2014 and that\u2019s why she chose to leave the Gates Foundation. She said naysayers about charitable efforts to empower women have frustrated her with their shortsightedness. She called America\u2019s high maternal mortality rate \u201cunconscionable\u201d and decried America\u2019s status as the only advanced economy without paid family leave at a national level. Just 2% of donations in the United States go to organizations focused on women and girls, French Gates noted. But she said investments in women\u2019s health will add significantly to the global economy. \u201cBecause I have been given this extraordinary opportunity, I am determined to do everything I can to seize it and to set an agenda that helps other women and girls set theirs, too,\u201d she wrote in her op-ed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/investing/melinda-french-gates-women/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "us"}}

The New England Aquarium in Boston urged the public to be on the lookout for sharks while enjoying the water as the unofficial start of summer gets underway, the non-profit shared in a news release Thursday. The aquarium\u2019s scientists said multiple marine mammals were discovered with shark bites recently off the Massachusetts coast, according to the release. White sharks are drawn to New England\u2019s inshore waters to prey on seals and other marine life through summer and into fall when activity peaks, the aquarium said in a Facebook post, and scientists expect to see a rise in sharks with the rise in warmer temperatures. \u201cAlthough scientists and fishers have not photographed a white shark yet this season, we know that they are here,\u201d New England Aquarium said on Facebook. Aquarium officials added hundreds of seals were recently sighted along area beaches and two white sharks were briefly spotted from an aerial survey off Monomoy Island in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Depending on the time of year, more than 15 shark species live in New England\u2019s waters, the New England Aquarium said. \u201cWe had a white shark eat a seal in front of some whale watchers this time last year,\u201d John Chisholm, an adjunct scientist in the aquarium\u2019s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life, told CNN via email. \u201cMay is when white shark activity typically picks up, so it\u2019s nothing out of the norm,\u201d he said. A fishing charter company reported a minke whale with a shark bite earlier this week off Chatham, Massachusetts, and Chisholm took photos showing a freshly shark-bitten seal in Plymouth, Massachusetts, according to the aquarium. \u201cWith beach weather in the forecast \u2026 this is a good reminder for people to review shark safety guidelines and be shark smart,\u201d Chisholm said in the release. Cape Cod National Seashore officials reported sharks are active in the park waters of each of its beaches, according to the National Park Service. The aquarium reported four confirmed white whale sightings so far this season as of Saturday, according to Chisholm. The New England Aquarium urged people to be aware of sharks swimming in shallow waters, avoiding spots where schools of fish or seals are visible, and remaining close to the shoreline so emergency responders can help if necessary, according to the release. People who spot sharks can report sightings through the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy\u2019s Sharktivity app, according to the conservancy and the aquarium. A 2023 study found a superpopulation size of around 800 white sharks in the Cape Cod area between 2015 and 2018. While the total number of unprovoked shark bites reported globally remains \u201cextremely low,\u201d according to the Florida Museum of Natural History\u2019s International Shark Attack File, unprovoked shark bite deaths rose over the past year with most of the deaths caused by white shark bites.

The Airbus plane, which was headed to Fort Lauderdale, reversed course and safely returned to Montego Bay, Jamaica, \u201cout of an abundance of caution following a suspected mechanical issue,\u201d the airline said in a statement.\u00a0The passengers were deplaned and later put on a different plane to reach their destination. The incident happened after a record-breaking start to the holiday weekend for airline travel. The Transportation Security Administration announced it set a new record for most travelers screened in a single day on Friday, according to a post from the agency on X. Passenger Bettina Rogers captured video of the plane\u2019s takeoff in which a chiming signal can be heard twice in the cabin, though the meaning of the signal is unclear. Shortly after the signal, the pilot told passengers there was \u201cnothing to be alarmed about,\u201d Rogers said. About five minutes later, the pilot informed passengers the plane needed to return to the Montego Bay airport, Rogers said. But as the plane turned back, she said, the pilot announced, \u201cPrepare for emergency water landing.\u201d \u201cIt was scary, and people were freaking out and panicking,\u201d Rogers said. After the flight landed safely, the cabin was full of nervous chatter and orange life vests scattered the floor and seats as passengers walked off the plane, video taken by Rogers shows. Passengers exited the plane \u201cunder normal procedures\u201d and a new plane was arranged to take them to Fort Lauderdale, Spirit said in its statement. Rogers was able to make it safely to her destination in Atlanta. \u201cSafety is our top priority, and the aircraft will be thoroughly evaluated by our maintenance team,\u201d the airline said. \u201cWe apologize to our Guests for any inconvenience.\u201d On Monday, a United Airlines flight aborted takeoff from Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport due to what the Federal Aviation Administration said was a reported engine fire.

Some travelers have expressed a growing sense of unease due to a handful of harrowing aircraft accidents and as well as a string of smaller mishaps and mechanical incidents on planes \u2013 mostly Boeing jets. The midflight blowout of an Alaska Airlines plug door kicked off the year, which has also since seen several severe cases of turbulence, including on a Singapore Airlines flight from London last week that left one person dead and 71 injured. A series of less severe mishaps have also drawn the attention of travelers and air safety regulators. The Federal Aviation Administration announced in March that it\u2019s taking a close look\u00a0at United Airlines after nearly a dozen incidents on its Boeing jets, including a\u00a0missing external panel, flames shooting from an engine after takeoff and a wheel popping off. Though such incidents have raised concern, aviation experts have pointed out that commercial flights remain one of the safest ways to travel in the US. The last major fatal commercial plane accident in the United States was in 2009, and between 2010 and 2022, there have been five commercial flight accident deaths.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/us/spirit-airlines-jamaica-flight-mechanical-issue/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_us_hot-dogs-american-favorite-ijgdi-cec", "text": "It\u2019s Memorial Day weekend, the unofficial kickoff of summer in the US, which means Americans are practically required under federal law to gather friends and family, fire up the grill and cook something. For many people, that means scarfing down some hot dogs. I will not be one of those people. In the vast smorgasbord of festive foods, hot dogs have never done it for me. I\u2019m not a vegetarian or a picky eater, and I\u2019m not on some nitrates-free health kick. I just don\u2019t care for them. During peak hot dog season, from Memorial Day to Labor Day, Americans consume an estimated 7 billion hot dogs. That makes me a statistical outlier at best, and at worst, maybe a traitor. Who doesn\u2019t like hot dogs? It\u2019s almost un-American, like disliking football or Dolly Parton. I pass no judgment on hot dog lovers, and I understand the appeal. Hot dogs are cheap, easy to cook, portable and endlessly customizable. They\u2019re the perfect outdoor food accessory: Grab a hot dog in one hand, and you still have another hand free for a cold beverage of your choice. At the famous annual Nathan\u2019s Hot Dog Eating Contest, perennial champ Joey Chestnut once snarfed down 75 of them in 10 minutes. I watched this on TV, and it was a little traumatic. This dislike may have deep roots in my childhood. My mother tells me that when I was about a year old, she cut up a hot dog and put the bite-size pieces on my high chair tray, within reach of my grubby little fingers. I popped one in my mouth and immediately began choking. She held me upside down and shook me until I coughed it up. From then on, my mother says I refused to eat hot dogs. I wasn\u2019t a fussy kid \u2014 I\u2019d heartily gobble up all kinds of vegetables (except for beets, which I didn\u2019t learn to appreciate until deep into adulthood). But hot dogs were a no go. Maybe I had some residual hot dog trauma. As an older kid, I no longer had to suffer through hot dogs at home. But out in the world, it was a different story. At friends\u2019 birthday parties, the parents often served hot dogs, and I didn\u2019t want to be the weird kid sitting there with a few chips on an otherwise empty paper plate. I found that if I drenched a hot dog in enough ketchup, mustard and relish, I could force it down and then turn my eager attention to the birthday cake. Baseball games were another problem. I love baseball, for all the old-timey reasons: Its leisurely rhythms, the surge of the crowd on a ball hit to the warning track, that exhilarating first glimpse of the field when you emerge from the ballpark tunnel. But back in the \u201870s, when I was young, ballparks didn\u2019t offer a vast array of food options. Boston\u2019s Fenway Park, where I saw many of my earliest baseball games, had vendors going up and down the aisles yelling \u201cFenway Franks! Get ya Fenway Franks heeaaah!\u201d Their sales pitches didn\u2019t sway me, but they also sold roasted peanuts. I ate a lot of peanuts. Right about now you might be thinking, \u201cWhy should I care if some guy at CNN doesn\u2019t like hot dogs?\u201d It\u2019s a fair question. But ask yourself: Have you ever disliked something that almost everyone else seems to enjoy? It feels a little lonely. It also can make you question your judgment. Everyone else I knew loved hot dogs \u2014 what was wrong with me? In such existential moments, you\u2019re faced with a choice: You can pretend to like the thing, and feel sort of phony. Or, while everyone else is zigging, you can embrace your zag. Admittedly, hot dogs are low stakes. It\u2019s another thing entirely to announce you don\u2019t like democracy, or true love, or grandmothers. Or maybe pizza. And yet for years, to avoid awkward questions, I hid my distaste. By the time I was in college, I decided to speak my truth. This didn\u2019t always go well. The summer I turned 18, I shared a beach house with three buddies, including two brothers whose mom paid us a visit one weekend and offered to make us lunch. When I learned what was on the menu I exclaimed, \u201cHot dogs? I hate hot dogs!\u201d just as their mother emerged from the kitchen with a steaming plate of franks. She shot me a look. Being the gracious charmer I was, I ate my dog in abashed silence. In case you\u2019re wondering, I have no issues with the many cousins of the humble hot dog. I will happily eat Italian sausages, andouille sausages and chorizo, which to me have more flavor and heft. Bratwurst are fine if slathered in spicy mustard. But by my twenties I\u2019d pretty much stopped eating hot dogs. I just couldn\u2019t get past how they tasted to me:\u00a0 sweaty and sour and vaguely curdled. Now here we are in 2024, and hot dogs \u2014 despite nutritional warnings that eating one could take 36 minutes off your life \u2014 seem as popular as ever. There are plant-based versions, which probably taste even more horrifying. People are having viral debates about whether or not a hot dog is a sandwich. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m allowed to answer that question. When I sat down to write this, it occurred to me that I hadn\u2019t eaten a hot dog in at least several decades. My personal experience with hot dogs was a little out of date. Maybe my taste buds had evolved? There was only one thing to do. In the interest of research, my girlfriend\u2019s dad helped me procure an eight-pack of all-beef franks and some Walmart hot dog buns. Nothing fancy. My girlfriend, her parents and I cooked the dogs up in a hot skillet, plopped them in the buns and squirted them with ketchup and yellow mustard. I took a bite. My three lunchtime companions all stared at me, curious to gauge my reaction. The verdict? Meh. The hot dog was not as terrible as I remembered. But it wasn\u2019t exactly tasty, either. The aftertaste lingered in my mouth like a bad houseguest. I tried my best, and I\u2019m ok with that. Don\u2019t hate me. So on this Memorial Day, I wish all hot dog lovers out there a frankly delicious holiday. Because of oddballs like me, there will be more hot dogs to go around for the rest of you.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/us/hot-dogs-american-favorite-ijgdi-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_28_politics_trump-hush-money-closing-arguments-takeaways", "text": "Prosecutors told jurors on Tuesday they\u2019ve seen a \u201cmountain of evidence\u201d to prove that Donald Trump falsified business records in order to cover up a damaging story about an alleged affair at the end of the 2016 election. Trump\u2019s attorneys told the jury that the prosecution\u2019s criminal case against the former president is wholly reliant on the testimony of Michael Cohen \u2013 the \u201cMVP of liars\u201d who is out to get Trump. Which narrative the jury believes could ultimately decide Trump\u2019s legal fate. The defense and prosecution gave their closing arguments in Trump\u2019s New York hush money trial, spending many hours late into the evening Tuesday offering the jury diametrically opposed stories about the payment made to\u00a0Stormy Daniels in October 2016 and the subsequent reimbursement to Cohen the following year. On Wednesday, Judge Juan Merchan will give the jury his instructions in the morning, and then jurors will begin deliberations, with the historic and unprecedented trial \u2013 and a pivotal moment in the 2024 presidential election \u2013 hanging in the balance. Here are takeaways from Day 21 of the Trump hush money trial: Defense argues jurors cannot convict on Michael Cohen\u2019s words Defense attorney Todd Blanche was up first, and he spent much of his two-hour closing argument attacking the credibility of Cohen, Trump\u2019s former fixer. He accused Cohen of lying directly to the jury, on top of the lies he was convicted of telling. Cohen lied so much, Blanche alleged, that he should be considered the Tom Brady of lying \u2013 the \u201cGLOAT,\u201d or the \u201cGreatest Liar of All Time.\u201d Blanche focused on Cohen\u2019s claims about his phone call with Trump on October 24, 2016. Cohen testified that Trump bodyguard Keith Schiller put Trump on the phone so Cohen could tell him he was going forward with the Daniels payment. During cross-examination, Blanche confronted Cohen with text messages he sent to Schiller around the same time as the call asking for help about a teenager prankster. \u201cWe all know that he called Keith Schiller to talk about the fact that a 14-year-old had been harassing him for several days and forgot to block his number, and Mr. Cohen wanted to fix that,\u201d Blanche said Tuesday. Blanche told the jury it\u2019s clear they were talking about the teen prankster because Cohen hung up and texted Schiller about the situation then followed up the next morning. \u201cThat is perjury,\u201d Blanche said, raising his voice as he slowly emphasized each syllable of the final word. Blanche also said that prosecutors offered no evidence connecting Trump to the payment to Daniels outside of Cohen\u2019s testimony. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that you can find that President Trump knew about this payment at the time it was made without believing the words of Michael Cohen, period. And you cannot \u2013 you cannot \u2013 believe his words,\u201d Blanche told the jury. At the end of his closing argument, Blanche again returned to Cohen. \u201cHis words cannot the trusted,\u201d Blanche said. \u201cHe came in here, he raised his right hand and he lied to each of you repeatedly. You cannot send someone to prison \u2013 you cannot convict somebody based upon the words of Michael Cohen.\u201d Prosecutors objected to Blanche\u2019s commentary about prison \u2013 and Merchan admonished him for saying it, because jurors are not allowed to consider penalties, that\u2019s up to the judge \u2013 but Blanche had made his point regardless. Prosecution defends Cohen but argues there\u2019s more to the case Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass pushed back against Blanche\u2019s attack when it was his turn to present to the jury in the afternoon, arguing there was plenty of corroboration of Cohen\u2019s testimony, both from documents and the testimony of others, particularly former AMI chief David Pecker. \u201cWe didn\u2019t choose Michael Cohen to be our witness. We didn\u2019t pick him up at the witness store. The defendant chose Michael Cohen as his fixer because he was willing to lie and cheat on his behalf,\u201d Steinglass said of Cohen. Steinglass tried to rebut Blanche\u2019s allegation about the October 24, 2016, call with a bit of role-playing. The prosecutor put his thumb and forefinger to the side of his head and acted out a theoretical call Cohen could have made where he talked to both Schiller and Trump. \u201cHey, Keith, how\u2019s it going? It seems like this prankster might be a 14-year-old kid,\u201d Steinglass began the fake conversation, pretending to move into asking Schiller to pass the phone to Trump and then acting out a quick update on Daniels and the payment. When he finished the fake conversation, Steinglass said, \u201c49 seconds.\u201d The call between Schiller and Cohen lasted 1 minute 36 seconds, according to call logs. \u201cThese guys know each other well. They speak in coded language, and they speak fast,\u201d Steinglass said of Cohen and Trump. Steinglass also focused on testimony from Pecker to help bolster Cohen\u2019s credibility, such as showing that Cohen\u2019s story was corroborated by Pecker\u2019s description of a phone call with Trump about the Karen McDougal story in June 2016. \u201cTrump is deputizing Cohen right in front of Pecker so that Pecker knows that any go ahead from Cohen is a go head from Trump. This call makes it impossible for the defense to claim that Cohen was acting on his own here,\u201d Steinglass said, calling it \u201cpowerful evidence of the defendant\u2019s involvement wholly apart from\u202fCohen.\u201d Prosecution walks jurors back through the whole case Steinglass spent 4 hours and 41 minutes walking jurors back through all of the documents and testimony they had heard over the six-week trial, beginning with the 2015 Trump Tower meeting all the way through Trump\u2019s pressure of Cohen in 2018 before Cohen began cooperating with federal investigators and pleaded guilty. \u201cThe name of the game was concealment, and all roads lead inescapably to the man that benefited the most, the defendant, former President Donald J. Trump,\u201d he said. Steinglass argued that Pecker, Trump and Cohen entered into a conspiracy in 2015 when Pecker agreed to be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of the campaign \u2013 alleging that the agreement went well beyond the normal bounds of a press relationship. When the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d story came out in October 2016, Steinglass said that Trump and the campaign went into panic mode. Around the time Trump\u2019s campaign was dealing with the fall out of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, he said, Trump was \u201cnegotiating to muzzle a porn star who was prepared to go public with allegations of extramarital sex.\u201d \u201cStormy Daniels was a walking, talking reminder that the defendant was not only words. She would have totally undermined his strategy for spinning away the \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape,\u201d Steinglass said. Steinglass noted that when Cohen paid Daniels\u2019 attorney the $130,000 wire transfer through an LLC, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising to jurors that Trump wasn\u2019t connected to the documents. \u201cNow it\u2019s true that Mr. Trump didn\u2019t sign these documents himself. That\u2019s kind of the whole point,\u201d Steinglass said. Steinglass walked jurors back through the hand-written calculations from former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg to repay Cohen, in which Weisselberg wrote on Cohen\u2019s bank statement that the reimbursement would be \u201cgrossed up\u201d to account for taxes. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to prove that the defendant made and created the false entries himself,\u201d Steinglass said. Trump is guilty of false business records when he makes or causes a false entry in his business records, Steinglass argued. Steinglass called the handwritten notes from Weisselberg and former Trump Org. controller Jeff McConney \u201cthe smoking guns.\u201d \u201cThey completely blow out of the water the defense claim that the payments\u201d were for \u201clegal services rendered,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m almost speechless that they\u2019re trying to make this argument.\u201d Defense tries to raise \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 with jury Throughout his presentation, Blanche continued to raise the concept of reasonable doubt with the jury \u2013 even punctuating the conclusion of his closing argument with \u201c10 reasons\u201d why jurors should have reasonable doubt about the case \u201cEach one of these reasons makes a not guilty verdict a very easy path and a very quick path,\u201d Blanche said. Among his arguments: that the invoices and vouchers created to pay Cohen were accurate because Cohen was working as Trump\u2019s attorney, that Trump had no intent to defraud and that there\u2019s no evidence Trump knew the invoices were sent. Blanche also argued there was no attempt to conceal or commit another crime \u2013 one of the conditions needed for a felony conviction \u2013 and there was \u201cabsolutely\u201d no agreement to influence the 2016 election. Blanche argued that AMI would have run former Trump Tower doorman Dino Sajudin\u2019s story about an alleged love child had it been true, that McDougal did not want her story published and that Daniels\u2019 story was already made public in 2011, well before the election. Blanche concluded where he started, arguing that Cohen was the \u201chuman embodiment of reasonable doubt.\u201d \u201cHe lied to you repeatedly. He lied many, many times before you even met him,\u201d Blanche said. \u201cHe is biased and motivated to tell you a story that is not true.\u201d Next up: The case will be in the jury\u2019s hands Now that closing arguments are done, the panel of seven men and five women are expected to begin deliberations Wednesday. Merchan is set to charge the jury Wednesday morning when they return at 10 a.m., giving them instructions on the law. The alternate jurors are expected to be held in the courthouse separate from the main panel that will consider the 34 counts against Trump. Trump and the attorneys for both sides must stay close to the courtroom in case the jury sends a note during deliberations. Reporters, too, will stay in the main and overflow courtrooms on verdict watch. Six weeks into the trial, this will be the first Wednesday that the jury will work as the usual trial schedule left Wednesdays dark for Merchan\u2019s other docket matters.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/politics/trump-hush-money-closing-arguments-takeaways/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "us"}}

Bankman-Fried himself\u00a0was sentenced earlier this year\u00a0to 25 years in prison for stealing $8 billion from FTX customers.

The pier was \u201cdamaged and sections of the pier need rebuilding and repairing,\u201d\u00a0Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said on Tuesday. The pier will be removed from its location on the Gaza coast over the next 48 hours and taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod, where US Central Command will carry out repairs, Singh said. The repairs will take more than a week, further delaying the effort to get the maritime corridor fully operating. Earlier, four US officials told CNN the pier broke apart in heavy seas. Part of the\u00a0pier, which consists of a narrow causeway to drive aid into Gaza and a wider parking area to drop off supplies\u00a0transported by ship, disconnected on Sunday, the officials said. The parking area will have to be reconnected to the causeway before\u00a0the\u00a0pier can be used again. The damage, first reported by NBC News, occurred three days after heavy seas forced two small US Army vessels to beach in Israel, according to US Central Command, while another two vessels broke free of their moorings and were anchored near the pier. \u201cI believe most of our soldiers were able to remain on the vessels and still are currently on them,\u201d Singh said during Tuesday\u2019s Pentagon press briefing. \u201cAnd \u2026 within the next 24 or 48 hours, the Israeli Navy will be helping push those vessels back and hopefully they\u2019ll be fully operational by then.\u201d The\u00a0pier,\u00a0which cost\u00a0$320 million,\u00a0had only begun operating on May 17 when heavy seas forced the maritime shipments to stop\u00a0one week later on May\u00a024,\u00a0two days before part of the pier disconnected.\u00a0It is unclear when shipments will resume. The temporary pier, called the Joint Logistics Over the Shore (JLOTS), requires very good sea\u00a0conditions\u00a0to operate. CNN reported previously that JLOTS can only be operated safely in a maximum of 3-foot waves and winds less than approximately 15 miles per hour. Heavier sea\u00a0conditions\u00a0delayed the deployment of the\u00a0pier\u00a0for several weeks, as the system sat docked in the Israeli port of Ashdod waiting for favorable conditions. The US has stressed that the temporary pier is only meant to augment humanitarian shipments going through the land crossings between Israel and Gaza. On Thursday, Vice Adm.\u00a0Brad Cooper,\u00a0deputy\u00a0commander of US Central Command, said 820 metric\u00a0tons\u00a0of aid had been delivered through the pier to the Gaza beach, where the United Nations was responsible for distributing it to the Palestinian population. The Pentagon said Thursday that more than 1,000 metric tons of aid had been delivered before the temporary pier had to halt operations. Daniel Dieckhaus, the director of USAID\u2019s Levant Response Management Team, told reporters Thursday that there were \u201cthousands and thousands of\u00a0tons\u201d of aid waiting in Cyprus to be delivered through the maritime corridor. But those shipments are now paused with the temporary pier inoperable. CNN\u2019s Paul Murphy contributed reporting. This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_05_26_us_braintree-massachusetts-amc-stabbing", "text": "A suspect was arrested Saturday after six people \u2013 including four girls between the ages of 9 and 17 \u2013 were stabbed in separate attacks that Massachusetts authorities say are likely connected. The girls, who were attacked at a movie theater, suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were taken to Boston hospitals for treatment, according to police in Braintree. About an hour later, a 21-year-old woman and a 29-year-old man were stabbed at a Plymouth McDonald\u2019s and taken to hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries. A suspect in the McDonald\u2019s stabbings, Jared Ravizza, was arrested 15 minutes after fleeing the scene Saturday night and faces multiple assault charges, the Plymouth County District Attorney\u2019s Office announced in a news release.  Ravizza, 26, is the suspect in \u201cmultiple South Shore stabbing incidents,\u201d the attorney\u2019s office said, though no details on the other incidents were provided. Braintree police have said it \u201cappears as though\u201d the attacks at the movie theater and McDonald\u2019s, which occurred about an hour apart, are related. The stabbing of the four girls at the AMC happened around 6 p.m. in Braintree. The theater was placed in lockdown shortly after the incident, an AMC employee told CNN. \u201cWithout saying anything and without any warning, he suddenly attacked and stabbed the four young females,\u201d police said of the suspect. \u201cThe attack appeared to be unprovoked. After the attack, the man ran out of the theater and left in a vehicle.\u201d Police discovered the suspect had left the theater in what appeared to be a black SUV, and video footage allowed authorities to capture its license plate, the release says. A vehicle matching the description was \u201creportedly involved in similar assault in Plymouth,\u201d which is about a 30-minute drive south of Braintree, police said. Ravizza allegedly arrived at the scene of the Plymouth McDonald\u2019s stabbings in a black Porsche Macan SUV, according to prosecutors. Police were called to the scene around 7 p.m., about an hour after the AMC attack in Braintree, the district attorney\u2019s office said. Surveillance footage from the McDonald\u2019s appears to show Ravizza reach through the drive-through window and stab the male victim with a large knife, prosecutors allege. Video then shows the suspect park his car, enter the restaurant and stab the female victim before fleeing in the car, according to the district attorney\u2019s office. Within minutes, state troopers located the suspect\u2019s car, but it failed to stop when they tried to pull it over. Police chased the vehicle, which \ufeffcrashed in Sandwich, about a 25-minute drive south of Plymouth, according to police. \u201cPreliminary investigation suggests a likely connection to an earlier incident at a movie theatre in Braintree resulting in non-life threatening injuries to four juveniles,\u201d state police said. Ravizza was being treated for non-life-threatening injuries at a hospital on Sunday, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. Ravizza will face multiple charges related to the McDonald\u2019s stabbings, including assault with intent to murder and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, prosecutors said. He is expected to appear in\u00a0court Tuesday. CNN has been unable to identify an attorney for Ravizza but has sought further information from the Massachusetts State Police,\u00a0Plymouth County District Attorney\u2019s Office and Braintree Police. The Massachusetts State Police\u2019s investigation is active and ongoing. Separately, Connecticut State Police said a suspect linked to a death in the town of Deep River had been taken into custody in Massachusetts. Police in neither state have confirmed whether the Connecticut case is connected to those in Massachusetts. In a statement released late Saturday, Connecticut State Police said they responded Saturday afternoon to a \u201cdisturbance\u201d at an address within the town. There, police found a \u201cdeceased individual\u201d whose identity has not been confirmed, Connecticut State Police said. \u201cA suspect in this investigation has been taken into custody in the State of Massachusetts and there is no active threat to the public,\u201d the release said.

However, the 2024 box office is seeing slumping sales following monthslong production delays and strikes that brought Hollywood to a standstill. Here\u2019s what else you need to know to\u00a0Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 1. Trump trial Former President Donald Trump\u2019s unprecedented criminal hush money trial is expected to be in the hands of jurors this week. The closing arguments set to begin today will allow prosecutors to explain to the 12 jurors how each witness they called and piece of evidence they presented bolsters their case for a guilty verdict on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. After Trump\u2019s attorneys also present their closing arguments, the judge presiding over the case will instruct the jury as to the charges it must consider against the former president. After that, the jurors will begin their deliberations. If convicted, the judge could sentence Trump to probation or a sentence of up to 4 years on each count in state prison, with a maximum of 20 years. 2. Gaza airstrikes Global outrage is mounting over Israel\u2019s airstrike on a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah that killed at least 45 people and wounded 200 others. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the strike a \u201ctragic error\u201d but reaffirmed that he would not end the war in Gaza until his military\u2019s goals were accomplished. The White House said it is \u201cactively engaging\u201d with officials in Israel to determine what precisely happened. The deadly strike comes just weeks after President Joe Biden told CNN that he\u2019d halt some shipments of American weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah. Israeli bombings in other areas of Gaza also killed at least six others today, a Palestinian news agency said. 3. Severe storms Around 47 million people are at risk for severe weather today as powerful storms continue to ravage parts of the central, southern and eastern US. Destructive thunderstorms and tornadoes were responsible for at least 23 deaths over the holiday weekend, including four children, in parts of Kentucky, Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma and Alabama. The storms killed 15 in Arkansas and Texas alone. Another five people died in Kentucky. Central and northern Texas appear to face the most serious threat of severe weather today. The area, which includes Austin, Dallas and Fort Worth, could be pelted by large hail, lightning and wind gusts as strong as 80 mph. A few tornadoes may also stir up, according to the National Weather Service. 4. Papua New Guinea Thousands of people have been ordered to evacuate Papua New Guinea following a massive landslide last week. As many as 2,000 people are feared to have been buried in the disaster that rattled the mountainous Enga region on Friday. Rescuers have struggled to reach such a remote part of what is already one of Asia\u2019s poorest nations, leaving locals with little choice but to dig through the mountainside with whatever tools they have. The area continues to pose an \u201cextreme risk,\u201d officials said, as rocks continue to fall and the soil is exposed to constant increased pressure. It\u2019s not clear what caused the landslide, but geologists say rainfall could have altered the minerals of the bedrock, weakening the rock that forms the steep hillsides. 5. Pope Francis Controversy is brewing at the Vatican after Pope Francis allegedly told Italian bishops not to permit gay men to train for the priesthood. Two Italian newspapers claimed that the 87-year-old pontiff made a homophobic slur in a closed-door meeting on May 20. The newspaper articles, which were translated from Italian, claimed the Pope had said there is \u201cfrociaggine\u201d \u2014 which translates in English to \u201cfaggotry\u201d \u2014 in some of the seminaries. A source close to the Pope told CNN that it could also be understood as there is a \u201cgay climate\u201d in the seminaries. CNN reached out to the Vatican to request comment on whether the Pope used the term but has not gotten a response.

The four inmates, all held in connection with violent crimes, escaped from the Tangipahoa Parish Jail north of New Orleans, according to a Facebook post from Sheriff Daniel Edwards. Two were taken into custody Monday morning. The sheriff\u2019s office identified the two inmates still at large as Omarion Hookfin, 19, and Jamarcus Cyprian, 20. \u201cWe feel that they\u2019re no longer in Tangipahoa Parish,\u201d Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office Chief of Operations Jimmy Travis said Monday. He added anyone who assisted the escapees in leaving the area would also face charges. Authorities believe two inmates left the facility in southeastern Louisiana\u2019s Amite City Saturday afternoon and the other two left Sunday afternoon, Travis said at a news conference. The sheriff\u2019s office did not learn the inmates had escaped until Sunday afternoon, when a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d contacted the warden and reported two of the escapees had come to a relative\u2019s house looking for a \u201cplace to stay,\u201d Jail administrators then realized a total of four inmates were missing. \u201cThe four inmates were able to escape the perimeter fence of the Parish Jail while participating in their recreation time on the yard,\u201d the sheriff said. A section of the fence was found in an inspection to be \u201cvulnerable and easily maneuvered\u201d\u00a0as to allow \u201ca small statured body\u201d to slide through, the Facebook post said. The two captured inmates, Avery Guidry, 19, and Travon Johnson, 21, were found hiding in the dumpster Monday morning, the sheriff\u2019s office reported. They were unarmed when found, Travis said. Hookfin, Guidry and Johnson were charged in connection to a 2022 home invasion that left a man dead and his 12-year-old daughter injured, CNN affiliate\u00a0WDSU reported. They were awaiting trial.

{"id": "2024_05_28_us_braintree-amc-stabbing-suspect-tuesday", "text": "Jared Ravizza, the suspect linked to stabbings this weekend at a Massachusetts movie theater and a McDonald\u2019s,\u00a0also will face criminal charges in Connecticut in connection to a killing in the town of Deep River, authorities said Tuesday. Ravizza was arraigned Tuesday in Plymouth District Court on four charges stemming from the McDonald\u2019s attack Saturday evening, including armed assault with intent to murder, two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and indecent exposure. The prosecution filed a motion for Ravizza, 26, to be held without bail, alleging the defendant was tied to another stabbing Saturday of four girls at a Braintree movie theater, as well as facing pending charges in Connecticut related to a homicide. By Tuesday afternoon, Ravizza had appeared in court a second time, where a doctor who evaluated the defendant\u2019s mental health said Ravizza did not \u201cdemonstrate the rational capacity\u201d to work with a defense attorney. The court subsequently ordered Ravizza sent to Bridgewater State Hospital and ordered a further evaluation. Sean O\u2019Neill, an attorney for Ravizza, said he had no comment at this time. The victims at McDonald\u2019s and the movie theater all suffered non-life-threatening injuries, authorities previously said. Connecticut State Police on Tuesday morning said Ravizza will face criminal charges stemming from a homicide in Deep River, which was also discovered Saturday. State troopers, responding around 3:30 p.m. to a reported disturbance, discovered a man identified as Bruce Feldman, 70, outside a home on Maritone Lane in Deep River, Connecticut State Police said in a news release. He was pronounced dead at the scene. \u201cDuring the initial investigation, Troopers developed information indicating that a second individual, who was no longer at the scene, had been present\u201d at the address \u201cearlier in the day,\u201d the release said. \u201cThe second individual was identified as Jared Ravizza.\u201d The investigation in Deep River remains ongoing, it added. \u2018Unprovoked\u2019 theater stabbing preceded McDonald\u2019s attack The two other attacks unfolded later that evening, beginning around 6 p.m. Saturday at an AMC movie theater in Braintree, some 10 miles south of Boston. \u201cWithout saying anything and without any warning, (the assailant) suddenly attacked and stabbed the four young females. The attack appeared to be unprovoked,\u201d Braintree police said in a news release, noting the girls were taken to Boston hospitals. The suspect then fled in what appeared to be a black SUV, police said, and video footage allowed authorities to capture its license plate. Soon after, \u201ca vehicle matching the description was reportedly involved in (a) similar assault in Plymouth,\u201d Braintree police said. In that incident, reported about an hour after the movie theater attack, a 21-year-old woman and a 29-year-old man were stabbed at a McDonald\u2019s. Assistant District Attorney David Cutshall identified both victims as employees at Tuesday\u2019s arraignment, telling the court Ravizza allegedly entered the restaurant\u2019s drive through in a black Porsche, stepped out of the vehicle and publicly urinated. Ravizza was \u201cargumentative\u201d with a male employee, then allegedly stabbed the employee in the forearm with \u201cwhat appeared to be a long kitchen knife.\u201d Ravizza parked the car, Cutshall said, before going inside and allegedly stabbing the female employee in her arm. Both victims are in stable condition, Cutshall added. Minutes later, Massachusetts state troopers identified the vehicle and tried to pull it over, but the driver failed to stop, state police said previously. A chase ensued, and the vehicle eventually crashed in Sandwich, south of Plymouth. Suspect is a self-described philanthropist and business owner Meanwhile, more details about Ravizza\u2019s background are emerging, including the fact the defendant was arrested last month in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, accused of assault and battery of a family member and vandalism, according to court records at Edgartown District Court. Records show the case has not been adjudicated. Ravizza\u2019s father told officers Jared \u201chad just had a mental break and attacked him\u201d inside his home,\u00a0The Boston Globe\u00a0reported, citing a police report on file with the court. The report also said Ravizza allegedly wrecked the father\u2019s home office, according to The Boston Globe. Ravizza was sent to Martha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital for a mental health evaluation, but \u201cdid not meet their standards to be held,\u201d the Boston Globe reported, citing the report. Ravizza is a self-described philanthropist, professional skier, business owner and artist, according to Ravizza\u2019s social media pages and newspaper reports. According to Ravizza\u2019s business website, Ravizza owns a digital marketing and social media management agency called \u201cRavizza Jones,\u201d which is\u00a0registered in Massachusetts. On its website, the business is described as a \u201cleading global digital marketing & social media management agency representing leading companies, brands and individuals in digital media and online marketing.\u201d Media outlets\u00a0such as\u00a0the\u00a0Martha\u2019s Vineyard Times\u00a0and SNOW Magazine\u00a0have previously interviewed Ravizza, who recalled past\u00a0philanthropy, activism and career as a professional skier. In a 2021 article, the\u00a0Martha Vineyard\u2019s Times described Ravizza as a professional skier who created a global initiative as \u201ca resource for people with autism, disabilities, and illnesses\u201d and said Ravizza \u201cworks with adults and athletes, providing mentorship and exercise, among other things.\u201d \u201cWe spend a lot of time on the Vineyard, in Massachusetts, and I just want people to know the accessibility to me,\u201d Ravizza told\u00a0The Martha Vineyard\u2019s Times in 2021. \u201cI also hope this story will inspire someone to start an initiative of their own \u2026 maybe you\u2019re someone on the Vineyard and you want to start helping people,\u201d Ravizza said. The suspect\u2019s Instagram account also includes several photos of Ravizza driving around in expensive cars, including the\u00a0same kind of\u00a0Porsche Ravizza allegedly drove\u00a0from the AMC theater to the McDonald\u2019s.

{"id": "2024_05_28_economy_us-economy-job-market-may", "text": "Americans\u2019 attitudes toward the economy improved this month for the first time since January, thanks to better perceptions of the job market. The Conference Board\u2019s Consumer Confidence Index for this month climbed to a reading of 102, up from 97.5 in April. Americans of all age groups felt better about the economy, the survey noted. That\u2019s after consumer confidence declined in each of the prior three months. \u201cConsumers\u2019 assessment of current business conditions was slightly less positive than last month. However, the strong labor market continued to bolster consumers\u2019 overall assessment of the present situation,\u201d Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, said in a release. Compared to the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer survey, the Conference Board survey puts more weight on perceptions of the job market. Unemployment remains below 4%, job openings still exceed the number of unemployed people seeking work and employers are still pumping out jobs at a brisk pace. But elevated inflation still looms large. That\u2019s precisely why consumer confidence declined for three straight months prior to May, when inflation readings came in hotter than expected. The April survey showed that \u201cconsumers cited prices, especially for food and groceries, as having the greatest impact on their view of the US economy,\u201d Peterson said. The survey also showed that respondents felt more upbeat about the stock market, with \u201c48.2% expecting stock prices to increase over the year ahead, compared to 25.4% expecting a decrease and 26.4% expecting no change.\u201d Major stock indexes have soared to record highs recently, with the Nasdaq Composite briefly breaking above 17,000 in intraday trading Tuesday. Separately on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released survey data on consumer expectations for a wide array of public policies, such as taxes, unemployment benefits and housing assistance. The survey, conducted in April, found that a higher share of Americans saw improved prospects for an increase in the federal minimum wage as well as higher welfare and unemployment benefits. Additionally, respondents\u2019 expectations increased for expansions in federal student aid as well as student loan forgiveness. However, in a time when home prices are setting new highs, the survey also showed that pessimism heightened about increases in housing assistance and affordable housing.The average likelihood of reduced housing assistance increased to 15%, the highest reading since December 2019, New York Fed data shows. Still, consumers were more optimistic about tax benefits for homeowners. The average likelihood for a higher mortgage interest tax deduction climbed to 24.8% \u2014 the highest ever reading for this New York Fed series, which was started in November 2015.
