{"id": "2024_05_16_us_daniel-perry-texas-pardon-recommendation", "text": "Daniel Perry, a former US Army sergeant who was convicted of murdering a protester at a Black Lives Matter rally in 2020, was released from prison Thursday after he was pardoned by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. Abbott\u2019s decision comes after the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted unanimously Thursday to recommend a full pardon and the restoration of firearm rights for Perry, who was sentenced last year to 25 years in prison. Shortly after he was pardoned, Perry was released from Texas Department of Criminal Justice custody, a spokesperson for the agency told CNN. Abbott asked the board to conduct an investigation in April 2023, and in a statement on Thursday, the board said its \u201cinvestigative efforts encompassed a meticulous review of pertinent documents, from police reports to court records, witness statements, and interviews with individuals linked to the case.\u201d Perry faced between five and 99 years in prison for fatally shooting 28-year-old Air Force veteran Garrett Foster at an Austin, Texas, racial justice rally two months after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Shortly after Perry\u2019s conviction in April 2023, Abbott said he wanted to pardon Perry and issued an unusual request for the state Board of Pardons and Paroles to expedite a review of the case before a sentence was handed down. \u201cAmong the voluminous files reviewed by the Board, they considered information provided by the Travis County District Attorney, the full investigative report on Daniel Perry, plus a review of all the testimony provided at trial,\u201d Abbott said in a statement. \u201cTexas has one of the strongest \u2018Stand Your Ground\u2019 laws of self-defense that cannot be nullified by a jury or a progressive District Attorney. I thank the Board for its thorough investigation, and I approve their pardon recommendation,\u201d Abbott said. The governor can only pardon Perry if the Board of Pardons and Paroles recommends it, according to Texas law. Doug O\u2019Connell, an attorney for Perry, said in a statement his client is \u201cthrilled\u201d to be free and thanked Abbott and the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole. \u201cI spoke with Daniel this afternoon. He is thrilled and elated to be free. Daniel is also optimistic for his future,\u201d O\u2019Connell said in a statement obtained by CNN. \u201cHe wishes that this tragic event never happened and wishes he never had to defend himself against Mr. Foster\u2019s unlawful actions. At the same time, Daniel recognizes that the Foster family is grieving.\u00a0We are anxious to see Daniel reunited with his family and loved ones.\u201d Prosecutors said Perry, who was stationed at Fort Hood, initiated the fatal encounter when he ran a red light and drove his vehicle into a crowd gathered at the protest. Foster was openly carrying an assault-style rifle \u2013 legal in Texas \u2013 and approached Perry\u2019s car and motioned for him to lower his window, at which point Perry fatally shot him with a handgun, prosecutors said. \u201cToday, a convicted murderer will walk the streets of Texas. Texas Republicans have once again proven that they cannot keep the public safe, they are not the party of \u2018tough on crime,\u2019 and they are not the party of \u2018law and order,\u2019\u201d Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement responding to the pardon. He added: \u201cMake no mistake: Daniel Perry is a murderer who was on a mission to commit violence against Texans, and today our justice system was hijacked for political gain.\u201d In a statement on Thursday, Foster\u2019s former fianc\u00e9e, Whitney Mitchell, said she is \u201cheartbroken by this lawlessness,\u201d adding Abbott has shown that \u201conly certain lives matter.\u201d \u201cHe has made us all less safe. Daniel Perry texted his friends about plans to murder a protestor he disagreed with,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter a lengthy trial, with an abundance of evidence, 12 impartial Texans determined he that he carried out that plan, and murdered the love of my life.\u201d \u201cWith this pardon, the Governor has desecrated the life of a murdered Texan, impugned that jury\u2019s just verdict, and declared that citizens can be killed with impunity as long as they hold political views that are different from those in power,\u201d Mitchell said. During Perry\u2019s sentencing hearing last May, the prosecution asked that he be sentenced to at least 25 years in prison. They highlighted a stream of racist and inflammatory social media posts Perry wrote prior to the shooting and the defense\u2019s own analysis of his mental disorders and mindset. \u201cThis man is a loaded gun ready to go off on any perceived threat that he thinks he has to address in his black and white world and his us versus them mentality,\u201d a prosecutor said. Perry\u2019s defense team asked for a sentence of 10 years, citing his lack of criminal history, his psychological issues, including complex post-traumatic stress disorder, and praise from several of his military colleagues. They argued his actions were\u00a0justified as self-defense. Perry told police during an interview that he believed Foster was going to aim the firearm at him, according to\u00a0CNN affiliate KEYE. Foster\u2019s mother, Sheila Foster, was \u201cin shock\u201d after learning of Abbott\u2019s pardon, according to Quentin Brogdon, the family\u2019s former attorney who spoke with the mother on Thursday. \u201cTo say that she is devastated is an understatement,\u201d\u00a0Brogdon\u00a0told CNN in a phone interview. The family had pursued a civil case against Perry\u00a0but dropped the case after he was convicted last year, satisfied with the jury \u201cholding him accountable,\u201d Brogdon said, adding the family will be considering any possible legal avenues but the prospects are \u201cgrim.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that the issuance of this pardon does not have some kind of political motivation,\u201d Brogdon said, citing Abbott\u2019s involvement in the case after conservative commentators criticized Perry\u2019s conviction last year. Perry diagnosed with complex PTSD and autism For the defense, Greg Hupp, a forensic psychologist who examined Perry twice in 2023, testified during his sentencing he diagnosed him with complex post-traumatic stress disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Combined with his military experience, Perry had an \u201cus versus them\u201d mentality in which his mindset was, \u201cI protect myself. I am ready for any imminent attack and anything out there can be a potential threat,\u201d Hupp said. On cross-examination, the prosecution noted that military records did not indicate either of these psychological issues. During Perry\u2019s sentencing, Mitchell testified through tears how her life had changed since his death. Mitchell is a quadruple amputee and said Foster had been her sole caretaker for the past 11 years, helping her get ready for the day, eat and work as a costume designer. They had bought a house in Austin together, and she said it\u2019s difficult to stay there without him. \u201cIt\u2019s hard every day that I\u2019m there. It\u2019s hard to sleep in my bed because he\u2019s not there,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was my main caregiver for 11 years and I\u2019ve had friends who have been taking care of me and have to learn how to do all that stuff that Garrett was doing for me for a decade, and it\u2019s hard because I had to get comfortable being vulnerable.\u201d Perry made comments on social media about killing protesters, documents show Documents related to the case that were unsealed by a Travis County judge following Perry\u2019s conviction show he had a yearslong history of making racist comments in messages and social media posts. In a Facebook message from May 2020, just weeks before the shooting, Perry told a friend he \u201cmight have to kill a few people\u201d who were rioting outside his apartment. The documents also contain a May 2020 text sent by Perry that said, \u201cI might go to Dallas to shoot looters.\u201d Some messages included \u201cwhite power\u201d memes. Perry wrote in a 2019 message that it was \u201cto bad we can\u2019t get paid for hunting Muslims in Europe.\u201d In a June 1, 2020, social media comment, Perry compared the Black Lives Matter movement to \u201ca zoo full of monkeys that are freaking out flinging their sh*t,\u201d the documents show. Clint Broden, Perry\u2019s attorney, criticized the release of the documents in a statement to CNN, calling it a political decision by prosecutors.

{"id": "2024_05_13_us_baltimore-bridge-collapse-demolition-monday", "text": "The trapped cargo ship Dali will \u201chopefully\u201d be refloated this week after authorities set off charges at a key portion of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore on Monday evening, an official said. The charges helped demolish a portion of the bridge wreckage that was resting on the ship \u2013 a move meant to help free the vessel, nearly seven weeks after it struck the bridge and caused the span to collapse. During the planned detonation, a chunk of the collapsed structure appeared to fall away from the ship and into the water, though a portion of wreckage remained on top of the ship, video showed. Officials are \u201cvery pleased\u201d with the demolition but will be conducting surveys with divers to make sure nothing fell and damaged the hull of the cargo vessel, US Army Corps of Engineers Col. Estee Pinchasin told reporters. Additionally, before the ship can be refloated, officials must verify that all the charges went off, Pinchasin said. A loud explosion rung out and dark plumes of smoke surrounded the wreckage after the charges were set off. A \u201ctremendous amount of steel\u201d was removed from the Dali, Pinchasin said. Authorities would now examine how the remaining debris sat on the bow of the ship, the colonel said. While teams are prepared to move the remaining wreckage, Pinchasin doesn\u2019t believe more explosives will be used, she said. The targeted explosion took place just after 5 p.m. ET after inclement weather, including lightning, had forced the operation to be postponed over the weekend. The demolition, which included using small explosives to break apart a massive chunk of the\u00a0Baltimore bridge\u00a0that collapsed on a cargo ship nearly seven weeks ago, was originally set for Saturday, but bad weather forced officials to push the operation to Sunday before it was eventually rescheduled for Monday, the Coast Guard said. After necessary assessments and surveys, the plan is to remove ballast to make the ship buoyant on its own and then use four tugboats to pull it out into the channel and escort it to the pier, US Coast Guard Capt. David O\u2019Connell said. Additional wreckage and containers will be removed from the Dali at the pier and the ship will undergo necessary, temporary repairs before more permanent ones can be made. \u201cHopefully we\u2019re going to refloat the Dali in the next few days. We still anticipate to be on time to open full channel by the end of the month,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. The 213-million-pound Dali cargo ship, veered off course March 26 and struck a pillar of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, causing the bridge to fall into the Patapsco River below. The collapse killed\u00a0six construction workers\u00a0and destroyed a key thoroughfare, threatening the economy at the Port of Baltimore. It also sparked multiple investigations into what went wrong and who is responsible. Monday\u2019s planned demolition comes days ahead of a Wednesday hearing scheduled by the\u00a0House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, with\u00a0testimony expected\u00a0from the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board and officials from the Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers and the US Department of Transportation. \u201cWe will absolutely not sacrifice safety for speed,\u201d the Coast Guard\u2019s Nick Ameen said Sunday of the weather delay. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a lightning strike in the area, that pushes the clock back, and so that clock just kept getting pushed back and pushed back.\u201d Officials began moving forward with the demolition process after the body of the sixth victim was recovered from the water last week. The 21 members of the ship\u2019s crew \u2013 who have not left the ship in the almost seven weeks since it struck the bridge \u2013 remained onboard during the operation, according to Darrel Wilson, a spokesperson for Synergy Marine Group, which manages the Dali. The crew members \u201care all safe and standing by to continue assisting the response,\u201d Wilson said. \u2018Safest and swiftest method to remove the bridge piece\u2019 \u201cThe safest and swiftest method to remove the bridge piece from on top of the M/V Dali is by precision cuts made with small charges,\u201d the Key Bridge Response Unified Command said in\u00a0a news release last week. \u201cThis is an industry-standard tool in controlled demolition that will break the span into smaller pieces,\u201d it added, \u201cwhich will allow the work of refloating the vessel and removing it from the federal channel.\u201d The US Army and the US Army Corps of Engineers had said the demolition process would \u201clook like multiple puffs of smoke and sound like fireworks,\u201d in an infographic. Nearby communities were to receive a \u201ccellular notification\u201d beforehand, according to\u00a0Unified Command, which includes\u00a0state and federal authorities, the US Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers among them. Ship\u2019s crew have not left since collision While engineers tackle the logistics of clearing a tangled mess of metal to free the Dali, members of Baltimore\u2019s seafaring community remain concerned for the crew\u2019s well-being given the length of time they\u2019ve been aboard the ship. \u201cThey will have a safe place on the vessel where they can shelter during the controlled explosion,\u201d Wilson, with Synergy Marine Group, said, adding the crew was \u201cholding up well\u201d despite the stress of recent weeks. \u201cEven though they are not sailing, they are still performing\u00a0their normal crew duties,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThis is still a large, complicated piece of equipment and there is a lot they have to look after.\u201d The Singapore Maritime Officers\u2019 Union and the Singapore Organization of Seamen issued a joint statement over the weekend saying they are concerned about \u201cthe potential criminalization\u201d of seafarers aboard the ship as the investigation unfolds. The crew is well taken care of but feels disconnected from the rest of the world, Rev. Josh Messick, executive director of the Baltimore International Seafarers\u2019 Center, told CNN. They have internet access, thanks to hotspots Messick\u2019s group helped deliver, but they do not have their cell phones. The FBI had confiscated the crew\u2019s cell phones as part of the investigation, Messick said. That has kept the crew members disconnected from their families and unable to access critical resources, the unions say. \u201cThey are a little anxious because of the phone situation. We are trying to get their cell phones back to them,\u201d Messick said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a phone, they can\u2019t access their online banking, their finances, their contacts, they can\u2019t look at photos of their loved ones before they go to sleep at night. It\u2019s a lot more than just a phone.\u201d According to the unions, their representatives were aboard the Dali in April to ensure the crew\u2019s well-being. They are requesting the crew\u2019s visas be extended or renewed to allow for shore leave. The unions are also requesting expedited repatriation for crew members not required for further investigation and the return of their electronics. \u201cHowever long the investigation takes, the crew\u2019s rights and welfare should not be infringed upon during its course,\u201d said Dave Heindel, president of the Seafarers International Union.

{"id": "2024_05_15_us_nakba-day-anniversary-palestinians", "text": "Mohammad Zarqa trembled with fear as he watched panicked crowds of people, screaming and covered in blood, rush into his small village on the outskirts of Jerusalem. \u201cYou have to run,\u201d he remembers a woman crying out, shocking Zarqa out of a daze and sending him racing home to warn his family. He was only 12 years old at the time, unaware of the looming war that would soon upend his life. It was April 9, 1948, and Jewish militias had just attacked Deir Yassin, a village about a mile northeast of Zarqa\u2019s home in Ein Karem in what was then the British Mandate of Palestine. At least 100 people, including women and children, were killed \u2013 many stripped, lined up and shot with automatic fire, according to reports from the time archived by the United Nations. The massacre is among the events that led to al-Nakba, or \u201cthe catastrophe,\u201d when roughly 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes by armed Jewish groups seeking to establish the state of Israel. \u201cWe thought we were going to be next,\u201d Zarqa, now 88, tells CNN from his home in New Jersey. \u201cMy father said, \u2018We cannot stay here. They\u2019re going to come and massacre us.\u2019 We had nothing, no weapons, nothing to defend ourselves. That\u2019s the day we became refugees.\u201d On Wednesday, Zarqa joins millions of Palestinians across the world to mark Nakba Day with protests and community events intended to honor the memory of the Palestinians killed and displaced in 1948 and the brutal war unfolding today in Gaza. Part of that commemoration includes a commitment to storytelling, Zarqa says, whereby survivors of the Nakba generation continue to share their experiences with younger Palestinians so the dream of liberation and return never dies. He believes it\u2019s the only way to understand the current war and work toward a just and lasting peace in the region. \u201cMy heart is bleeding,\u201d he says softly. \u201cAt my age, I\u2019m still dreaming of going back home. Palestine is something that is still implanted in my heart and my body. It\u2019s where I was born. It\u2019s where I have my memories. It\u2019s my country.\u201d Yearning for home Zarqa, along with his parents and six siblings, fled Ein Karem on foot, taking very little with them. They walked from village to village, searching for food and sheltering in the homes and garages of kind strangers. The atrocities he witnessed along the way are seared in his memory. \u201cI saw the most horrific things in my life: women coming in with torn clothes and uncovered heads crying, screaming, saying that the Jews \u2013 they weren\u2019t called Israelis at the time \u2013 attacked their village and massacred everybody,\u201d Zarqa says. More than 15,000 Palestinians were killed and 531 towns and villages destroyed during al-Nakba, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, an institute of the Palestinian Authority. Jewish leaders declared independence and the creation of the state of Israel on May 14, sparking a military response from Egypt, Syria and Jordan. The family hoped the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, as it would come to be known, would end in a swift victory for the Arabs. After several weeks, Zarqa\u2019s family returned to Ein Karem. But when they entered the village, they found it had been ransacked and its residents cast out by Jewish militias, Zarqa says. With nothing left to salvage, they fled to Jordan to wait out the war, he recalls. The family initially lived in squalor, surviving off the generosity of strangers and local mosques. They shared a home with other Palestinian refugees in Jabal Al Weibdeh, a neighborhood in Amman, Zarqa says. It had a dirt floor and there were no windows, doors or bathrooms. They often couldn\u2019t shower for months at a time. By March 1949, Israel had won the war and forbidden the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees who had fled or were expelled from returning to their homes and ancestral lands. Zarqa\u2019s family was among them. The family began to build a new life in Jordan, one marked by struggle and poverty, as they patiently waited for permission to return to Ein Karem. But it never came, and decades later Zarqa found himself living in the United States \u2013 even further from his homeland \u2013 trying to raise a small family of his own. \u201cWe made a life in the US, but this still isn\u2019t home. You never forget that you had a house and somebody kicked you out of it,\u201d Zarqa says. \u201cWe will never stop wanting to return.\u201d A responsibility to teach Neither time nor distance has blurred Zarqa\u2019s memories of Palestine. He has passed onto his four children and eight grandchildren every bittersweet memory of Ein Karem, from its acres of orchards to the hilltop where he could see the mountains and Mediterranean sea in the distance. Zarqa remembers Ein Karem so vividly that despite his decades of absence, he was able to give his grandson, Zach Matari, who visited the village in 2019, directions over FaceTime to his old home, now in present-day Israel. An Israeli family is living there. \u201cI remember every inch of my village. If you go there I can tell you there was this apricot tree here, and there was a fig tree there, and that\u2019s the stairs we used to climb,\u201d he says. Jenan Matari, another one of his grandchildren, is a writer and social media influencer who uses her platform to educate followers about Palestinian history, culture and current events, including the war in Gaza. She loves listening to her grandfather\u2019s stories and says her work, which is rooted in his Nakba experience, is a form of resistance. All Palestinians in the diaspora, she says, should use their voices too. \u201cI get really sad for my grandfather, because if I\u2019m feeling triggered by the things that are happening in Gaza, and I\u2019m feeling this depleted and in so much pain watching this, I can only imagine what it\u2019s doing to him and his generation to watch what they lived through happening again, but on an even greater scale,\u201d Matari, 33, tells CNN. Talking about al-Nakba isn\u2019t easy, Zarqa confesses. He often pauses mid-sentence or changes the subject when it hurts a bit too much. But he refuses to be silenced by his grief and even invites other Nakba survivors to his home to share their experiences with family, friends and the wider community Dawud Assad, one of those survivors, lives just 10 miles away. He narrowly survived the Deir Yassin massacre, which he says claimed the lives of 47 family members, including his grandmother and 2-year-old brother. \u201cI was supposed to be dead,\u201d says Assad, who is now 92 and nicknamed Al-shaheed Al-hay, or \u201cthe living martyr.\u201d Assad survived by hiding in a shallow trench near his home, crouching and quietly praying for mercy as bullets grazed his hair. \u201cIt did not begin on October 7. What we went through is exactly what we\u2019re seeing now in Gaza and Rafah,\u201d Assad says, referring to Israel\u2019s ongoing war there. Videos of dead children are especially triggering because they remind him of his slain brother. Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas\u2019 brutal attack in Israel on October 7, in which 1,200 people were killed and hundreds of others taken hostage, Israeli officials say. In the seven months since that attack, Israel\u2019s bombing campaign and ground offensive in Gaza has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. It also has imposed a siege and razed entire communities, rendering nearly 90% of the population displaced and everyone food insecure. Israel says its military tactics are necessary to defeat Hamas and return the hostages. The International Court of Justice says it\u2019s \u201cplausible\u201d Israel is committing genocide, though a final ruling in the case could take years. Israel \u201cutterly rejects\u201d the allegation. For Zarqa and Assad, the war is reminiscent of the horrors they endured during al-Nakba, and it\u2019s important for them to draw that parallel for young Palestinians in the diaspora, as well as anyone else trying to make sense of the violence. \u201cAl-Nakba never ended,\u201d Zarqa says. They point to recent statements from Israeli officials that have alluded to another Nakba through suggestions of mass killing and displacement, or outright calling for it. In a November interview with Israel\u2019s Channel 12 news, Minister of Agriculture Avi Dichter described the war as \u201cthe Nakba of Gaza 2023.\u201d Following Dichter\u2019s comments, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly urged ministers to choose their words more carefully. \u201cWe must be sensitive,\u201d he said, according to The Times of Israel. Hope for the future Zarqa\u2019s heart remains torn between nostalgia and grief as he concedes he may never again see his beloved Palestine, stroll through the quiet streets of Ein Karem or taste its delicious apricots. But he\u2019s sure his descendants will. There are some 5.9 million Palestinian refugees worldwide, most of them descendants of that 1948 generation of exiles, according to the United Nations. It is \u201cthe world\u2019s longest-standing protracted refugee crisis,\u201d the UN said at a 2023 event marking the 75th anniversary of al-Nakba as it urged a solution grounded in international law. While some countries, including the United States and United Kingdom, skipped the commemoration after Israel called for a boycott, Zarqa elsewhere sees hope: The anti-war protests taking over city streets and college campuses across the world. \u201cI am so proud of them,\u201d Zarqa says. \u201cYou pass on your stories to your children and then they carry the banner and continue to teach their children, and eventually their own grandchildren.\u201d \u201cPalestinians will never forget.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/us/nakba-day-anniversary-palestinians/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "us"}}

Dell, who sustained a minor wound, was caught in the middle of the shooting in Sanford and had no connection to the gunman, Seminole County Sheriff Dennis Lemma said at a news conference Monday afternoon. Sanford is about 20 miles north of Orlando. A judge moved the suspect, Christopher Bouie Jr., from juvenile to adult circuit court on Monday, according to a news release from the Office of the State Attorney for the 18th\u00a0Judicial Circuit. Bouie is charged with five counts of attempted second-degree murder while discharging a firearm and one count of possession of a firearm by a minor in connection with the shooting, court records show. Lemma said nine of the 10 people who were shot have been released from the hospital with minor wounds. The last victim should be released soon, he said. Investigators believe the juvenile pulled out a 9mm handgun following a physical altercation and began firing, according to the sheriff. The search continues for a second person who may have fired in self-defense, Lemma said. \u201cSo what we have is two people engaged in gunfire on the left and right side of the physical altercation that is going on,\u201d he said. The state attorney said Tuesday an investigation into additional shots fired by another patron of the club is \u201cactive and ongoing.\u201d Bouie was transferred to the Seminole County Jail and will be held without bond, the release said. His first appearance in Seminole County Court is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, according to court records. CNN has reached out to Bouie\u2019s attorney for comment. Lemma said the actions of a security guard who tackled the suspect to the ground and turned him in to\u00a0police \u201ctook a very dangerous situation and made it less significant than what the potential could have been.\u201d About 200 people were at the event, including Dell, who was invited by promoters. It was being held at Cabana Live, which is open to the public as a restaurant and bar. The venue also is leased out for private events and parties, the sheriff said. Promoters had 10 armed security members on site. The sheriff said he does not know how the suspect made it into the party, and the investigation is ongoing. He added the gun recovered was legally purchased\u00a0in Miami in 2018, but does not know how the teen allegedly obtained it.

{"id": "2024_05_15_us_baltimore-bridge-collapse-house-hearing", "text": "The cargo ship Dali experienced two blackouts while moored in the Port of Baltimore a day before its catastrophic collision with the Francis Scott Key Bridge, and efforts to resolve those blackouts may have impacted the ship\u2019s operations, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said in a congressional hearing Wednesday. After the two in-port blackouts on March 25, the ship\u2019s crew switched to a different transformer and set of breakers from those that had been in use for several months, according to NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy. That may have impacted the ship\u2019s operations when it left the port a day later, she said. \u201cSwitching breakers is not unusual but may have affected operations the very next day on the accident voyage,\u201d Homendy said. The comments, which add further context to the focus of the NTSB investigation, came during a hearing for the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure reviewing and analyzing the federal response to the collapse of the Key bridge on March 26. On Tuesday, the NTSB released a 24-page preliminary report detailing investigators\u2019 early factual findings. The Dali struck the bridge with enough force to bring down the 1.6-mile-long steel structure, killing six construction workers on the bridge and severing access to critical shipping routes in and out of the Port of Baltimore. The report found the Dali was just three ships\u2019 lengths from the bridge when it suffered a pair of catastrophic electrical failures, which\u00a0caused several pumps required for the ship\u2019s propeller and rudder to stop working. The emergency generator activated but was not configured to power the ship, the report said. At Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Homendy described the ship as \u201cessentially drifting\u201d before crashing into the bridge. The NTSB report found that the Dali had experienced two blackouts a day earlier while still moored in the port. \u201cThe NTSB is still investigating the electrical configuration following the first in-port blackout and potential impacts on the events during the accident voyage,\u201d the report states. Homendy said Wednesday the NTSB has been working closely with Hyundai, which manufactures the ship equipment, to try to replicate some of the electrical problems of that day and understand better what happened. An NTSB preliminary report does not conclude a probable cause. Those findings will be part of a final report that could take investigators up to two years to complete. Officials estimate cost and timeline of replacement bridge The House committee hearing Wednesday featured testimony from Homendy, Coast Guard Vice Adm. Peter Gautier, Army Corps of Engineers Major Gen. William H. Graham and Federal Highway Administration Administrator Shailen Bhatt. The officials offered several estimates for the steps ahead. The Dali is expected to be refloated and removed from the port early next week, Gautier said, and the full channel is on track to be open by the end of May, Graham said. Further, a new replacement bridge is estimated to be open in 2028 and cost about $1.7 to $1.9 billion, Bhatt said. In the meantime, Homendy recommended that bridge operators and owners reexamine how US bridges are protected from incoming ships, noting the increasing size of cargo ships over the decades. \u201cIn this situation, you have a bridge that began operations in 1977, and if it was built today it would be built differently,\u201d she said. Video footage from moments before the crash showed plumes of black smoke coming from the 213-million pound vessel as well as the lights\u00a0flickering on and off. The NTSB report details the frantic efforts of those on the Dali to stop the ship and warn those on the bridge of potential disaster. The report also highlights the near-catastrophic experiences of a crew member on the ship and a road maintenance inspector on the bridge. The crew member was on the bow of the ship at the time of the crash. \u201c(He) told investigators that, as he was releasing the brake on the port anchor, he had to escape from the falling bridge before he was able to reapply the brake,\u201d the report states. The inspector on the bridge had been walking the span when the ship struck. \u201cHe ran north and made it to the nearest surviving span before the rest of the bridge collapsed,\u201d the report states. Six construction workers\u00a0who were filling potholes on the bridge were killed in the disaster. The victims were immigrants from El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras\u00a0who worked\u00a0to support their families.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/us/baltimore-bridge-collapse-house-hearing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_business_whats-at-stake-in-the-union-election-at-mercedes-benz-plant-in-alabama", "text": "A high-stakes union election is underway at a Mercedes-Benz plant near Tuscaloosa, Alabama, the only plant for the luxury automaker in North America. The fallout will be significant whether the workers at Mercedes-Benz vote to join the United Auto Workers union or not. The UAW is hoping to carry its strong momentum right now, as its decision to use a \u201cstand up strike\u201d strategy hitting the Big Three automakers all at once brought unprecedented attention and record contracts for workers. And last month, it won a union election at a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, its first victory in three attempts to organize the factory. Winning the Alabama vote would mean the UAW\u2019s biggest push to grow its membership in decades will keep going. The UAW watched for decades as non-unionized factories owned by companies from Kia to Toyota to Tesla to Rivian popped up across the country, especially in the southern United States. But under relatively new UAW president Shawn Fain, the strategy has changed. In an interview with Car and Driver, Fain said the profit margins for the Japanese, Korean and German automakers were \u201cobscenely more gross than they were at the Big Three, and yet their workers get less.\u201d \u201cI truly believe we\u2019re going to see a huge shift this year. I think we\u2019re gonna win in the South,\u201d he said in the interview. But a loss could stall those efforts \u2014 and reaffirm the South\u2019s reputation as a union-free, corporate-friendly region. In November 2023, the UAW said it began an effort to organize workers at 13 non-union auto US factories. The effort included three US-based electric vehicle makers \u2014 Tesla, Rivian and Lucid \u2014 as well as 10 foreign automakers that build cars in the US \u2014 BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Mercedes, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Volvo. The Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance, Alabama, near Tuscaloosa, has about 6,000 hourly workers. Voting is set to end Friday morning. Mercedes\u2019 response In a statement, Mercedes-Benz US International said it \u201cfully respects our Team Members\u2019 choice whether to unionize and we look forward to participating in the election process to ensure every Team Member has a chance to cast their own secret-ballot vote, as well as having access to the information necessary to make an informed choice.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean Mercedes would let its workers unionize without putting up a fight, as the company has used language and tactics common to corporations that are resistant to organizing efforts. \u201cWe believe open and direct communication with our Team Members is the best path forward to ensure continued success,\u201d the statement said. In a separate statement, MBUSI said that it \u201chas a proven record of competitively compensating Team Members and providing many additional benefits.\u201d And the company is allegedly pushing back against unionization efforts in other ways, according to six unfair labor practice charges filed by the UAW. The National Labor Relations Board said it is investigating six unfair labor practice charges filed by the UAW against Mercedes-Benz since March. Those charges allege Mercedes has disciplined employees for discussing unionization during work, prohibited distribution of union materials, surveilled employees, and forced employees to attend \u201ccaptive audience meetings,\u201d which is a mandatory meeting during work meant to discourage unionizing. Mercedes-Benz US International denied these claims, and said in a statement it \u201chas not interfered with or retaliated against any Team Member in their right to pursue union representation.\u201d It continued, \u201cWe do not believe these claims have merit and we look forward to presenting our case to the NLRB.\u201d Building off momentum Last month, hourly workers at Volkswagen\u2019s plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, overwhelmingly voted to join the UAW \u2014 73% of the 3,600 workers at the plant who cast ballots had voted to join the union. The victory didn\u2019t come easy for the UAW. Volkswagen didn\u2019t win until its third union drive, said Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at\u00a0Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations\u2019 Buffalo office. And this is the Mercedes plant\u2019s first strong push. \u201cIt\u2019s not a catastrophe if they don\u2019t win (the first time). Primarily because they\u2019re facing a very active Mercedes Benz trying to block them from organizing, you got governors in the South trying to block them from organizing, and they don\u2019t have the same track record or history or infrastructure in Alabama,\u201d Wheaton said. Even more broadly, unions have enjoyed a successful run \u2014 they won\u00a0pay increases of 10% or more\u00a0for nearly a million union members last year, according to an analysis by CNN.\u00a0Strikes\u00a0were at a decade high in 2023, and organizing activity also increased. \u201cLabor has something to bring to the table. You see the successes at the bargaining table. It makes people more aware that the union may have something to offer,\u201d Wheaton said. Why this election matters This election has huge implications for the UAW\u2019s organizing efforts beyond the Big Three unionized automakers \u2013 GM, Ford and Stellantis. The South has a much lower level of union representation than workers in industrial regions in the North. But a labor expert says a loss would not be the end of the UAW\u2019s efforts in organizing in the South. \u201cIt\u2019s not horrible if they lose, because it gives the UAW the chance to see where they\u2019re at. They can gauge how much support they have,\u201d Wheaton said. There are about 150,000 workers at nonunion auto plants in the United States today. That\u2019s roughly the same amount of workers represented at the Big Three. The UAW is at the point where more than a majority of autos that are sold in the US are assembled and produced in plants that don\u2019t have UAW representation, which weakens their bargaining power at the Big Three, Harry Katz, professor of collective bargaining at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations said. Since 1990, the South\u2019s share of auto jobs has doubled from around 15% to 30% today, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Meanwhile, the Midwest\u2019s share has declined from 60% to 45%. \u201cSo much of auto production is occurring in plants not represented by the UAW. The management then threatens to move production to those other sites,\u201d Katz said. A lot at stake Katz said a win would not be a bellwether event, and the consequences of the union losing the vote will be even greater than the positive outcome if they win, he said. \u201cIt would be an important victory, but it wouldn\u2019t signal that there\u2019s necessarily signs that unions are going to have a cakewalk, an easy path to winning in either the other transplants or in many other organizations,\u2019\u201d Katz said. Though a union win could generate momentum, it doesn\u2019t mean a victory will mean other plants can overcome management opposition at other foreign-owned plants. Non-union automakers have already begun their response to the big union victories thus far. Toyota, Honda and Hyundai all announced raises for their US factory workers within two weeks of tentative contract agreements with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. And workers at those plants might be content with the non-union status they\u2019ve worked under already. \u201cThose plants\u2019 management has a lot of communication engagement strategies that \u2013rightfully or not \u2013 seem to satisfy the worker,\u201d Katz said, who said those workers are already earning significantly more than their local labor markets. And there is pressure from local politicians as well. Six southern governors from Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas issued a joint statement in April discouraging the union campaign, warning it could put workers\u2019 jobs, as well as the auto industry in the South, in jeopardy. The statement came a day before workers at Volkswagen voted on joining the UAW. \u201cThe reality is companies have choices when it comes to where to invest and bring jobs and opportunity. We have worked tirelessly on behalf of our constituents to bring good-paying jobs to our states. These jobs have become part of the fabric of the automotive manufacturing industry,\u201d the statement said. CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore and Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_16_us_morehouse-college-graduation-biden-commencement", "text": "Morehouse College President David A. Thomas said Thursday he would shut down commencement ceremonies \u201con the spot\u201d rather than allow police to remove student protesters in zip ties during President Joe Biden\u2019s graduation speech. Biden\u2019s scheduled commencement speech Sunday at one of the nation\u2019s preeminent historically Black colleges comes as school officials around the country have called in law enforcement to\u00a0clear pro-Palestinian encampments and quell demonstrations\u00a0in recent weeks. \u201cWhat we won\u2019t allow is disruptive behavior that prevents the ceremony or services from proceeding in a manner that those in attendance can partake and enjoy,\u201d Thomas told CNN in an interview Thursday. \u201cSo, for example, prolonged shouting down of the president as he speaks. I have also made a decision that we will also not ask police to take individuals out of commencement in zip ties. If faced with the choice, I will cease the ceremonies on the spot If we were to reach that position.\u201d Biden\u2019s presence on the Atlanta campus also comes as he seeks to persuade young voters to send him to the White House for another term, even as many have expressed frustration for his administration\u2019s continued support of Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza. Thomas said the college will not allow \u201chate speech,\u201d meaning any \u201ccalls for violence against another group or individual.\u201d He said Morehouse is a place that \u201ccan hold the tensions\u201d that have come to a boil at campuses across the nation. \u201cI would rather be the first president to have a failed commencement than to say you are less important than the ceremonies of this institution,\u201d Thomas told CNN. \u201cI thought about it from the vantage point of how should Morehouse show up as an institution. And we should never put the ego of the institution above our values. And one of our values is to see the humanity in all,\u201d he added. Thomas said Morehouse faculty members earlier Thursday voted to award Biden an honorary degree. He said Biden\u2019s decades as a public servant as well as a domestic and international leader whose body of work \u201cmerits an honorary degree from Morehouse College.\u201d \u201cWe need some place in this country that can hold the tensions that threaten to divide us,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe look around some of the most venerable institutions of higher education have canceled commencement, canceled valedictorian speakers because of their having spoken out and exercised their rights to free speech.\u201d Thomas said the college would allow silent, non-disruptive protest, even students turning their chairs or theirs backs on Biden \u2013 which, he said, would embarrass him. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t conduct yourselves in a way that deprives others from being able to participate, consume and celebrate this moment,\u201d said Thomas, who has led Morehouse since 2018. \u201cSilent protests. You want to walk across the stage in a piece of garment that identifies your moral connection to either side of this conflict because we also have Jewish students here, you can do that.\u201d CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. Protests have erupted at college campuses across the country as students have demanded that universities divest from Israel. Commencement ceremonies are taking place against a backdrop of police barricades and heightened law enforcement presence, metal detectors and other security measures. Biden has been\u00a0confronted by some protests\u00a0during his own speeches and campaign events. A Biden speech on abortion rights at George Mason University in Virginia earlier this year was marred by more than a dozen protests over his administration\u2019s support of Israel. Biden is also expected to deliver a commencement address at the United States Military Academy at West Point on May 25.

{"id": "2024_05_15_us_law-enforcement-detains-protesters-university-of-california-irvine-encampment", "text": "Police detained at least a dozen pro-Palestinian demonstrators at the University of California, Irvine, as they cleared an encampment in front of a lecture hall on Wednesday. \u201cA group of several hundred protestors entered the UC Irvine campus and began surrounding\u201d the school\u2019s Physical Sciences Lecture Hall at\u00a0around 2:30 p.m., the\u00a0university\u00a0said in an emergency update. The\u00a0university\u00a0put out a mutual aid call to local law\u00a0enforcement\u00a0and received assistance from the\u00a0Irvine\u00a0Police Department and Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department, it said. The protesters moved \u201cin a coordinated fashion \u2026 out of the encampment to the Physical Sciences Lecture Hall, where a small group barricaded themselves in, supported by a large group of community members who had gathered for a scheduled rally,\u201d said Chancellor Howard Gillman in a statement after the police action. \u201cWhat a sad day for our university. I\u2019m brokenhearted,\u201d Gillman said. \u201cAfter weeks when the encampers assured our community that they were committed to maintaining a peaceful and nondisruptive encampment, it was terrible to see that they would dramatically alter the situation in a way that was a direct assault on the rights of other students and the university mission.\u201d Authorities cleared\u00a0what looked like at least half\u00a0of student protesters at\u00a0the encampment, aerial footage from CNN affiliate KABC showed. At least a dozen people were seen being detained in the video. Law enforcement used zip ties to restrain protesters and escorted them\u00a0away from the encampment toward a parking lot. It\u2019s unclear exactly how many people were detained during the incident. CNN has reached out to the Irvine Police Department, the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department and UC Irvine to confirm the number of protesters who were detained. Law\u00a0enforcement\u00a0started breaking up the\u00a0encampment\u00a0at\u00a0the\u00a0university shortly after 5:10 p.m. Wednesday, aerials show. The aerial footage shows a large cluster of police officers surrounding the group of tents outside the hall as they face a line of several protesters, and a number of protesters can be seen getting detained. Protesters seemingly attempted to reestablish a barrier\u00a0taken down earlier by law enforcement\u00a0by piling wood panels and tents on top of one another.\u00a0Live pictures from KABC show\u00a0law enforcement\u00a0dismantling these structures. A sign on the building behind the encampment says \u201cUC Divest from genocide\u201d and another under it appears to say \u201cdrop suspensions defend students.\u201d A large sign hung next to those on the building reads \u201cAlex Odeh Hall,\u201d seemingly referencing the Palestinian activist who served as the West Coast regional director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. The\u00a0majority of the protesters have dispersed from\u00a0their encampment, but a small group of people remained scattered in a grassy area nearby, footage from KABC and KCAL show. \u201cProtest activity continues in the Physical Science Quad and Aldrich Park areas,\u201d the university said. \u201cPlease avoid the area until further notice.\u201d Classes were canceled for the remainder\u00a0of\u00a0the day Wednesday and the\u00a0university\u00a0urged people to stay away from campus, according to the emergency update. The university initially asked anyone in the area to shelter in place, but later said they should leave the area. Classes will be\u00a0held\u00a0remotely Thursday, the university said in an\u00a0emergency update. Divestment negotiations were ongoing Pro-Palestinian protesters had established an encampment on the campus on April 29. That day, the university called in local law enforcement officials to assist campus police with the protest. Days later, Gillman said in a statement to the campus community that the university would continue to negotiate with pro-Palestinian demonstrators on campus over issues of divestment. Student protesters opposing Israel\u2019s military action in Gaza have largely demanded their universities sell investments in companies with financial ties to Israel. The university presented a proposal to student leaders and received a counterproposal in early May. Gillman expressed concerns over some of the requests included in the counterproposal, according to the statement. \u201cThe counterproposal calls for ending numerous external partnerships that support our students through scholarships and facilitate long-standing research collaborations,\u201d Gillman said. \u201cIt also demands an end to a wide-range of academic and research collaborations with Israeli organizations and individuals. This would violate fundamental principles of academic freedom and would require us to discriminate based on a person\u2019s nationality, which goes against our commitment to anti-discrimination and our principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion.\u201d In the statement, Gillman also thanked student protesters for ensuring that their encampment \u201cremains peaceful and minimally disruptive of university activities.\u201d \u201cAs long as this remains the situation, there is no cause to involve law enforcement, except as needed to help ensure the safety of the protestors and others in the area,\u201d he said at the time. In his Wednesday statement, Gillman said UC Irvine \u201calong with most other UC campuses, received the latest \u2018demands\u2019 from the protesters\u201d earlier that day. The demands \u201cattempted to dictate that anyone who disagreed with them must conform to their opinions,\u201d Gillman said. \u201cBut my concern now is not the unreasonableness of their demands. It is their decision to transform a manageable situation that did not have to involve police into a situation that required a different response,\u201d Gillman said in the statement. Irvine Mayor says protests are \u201cnot a threat\u201d In response to UC Irvine\u2019s law enforcement presence, Irvine Mayor Farrah N. Khan said protesters don\u2019t threaten campus security and shouldn\u2019t be met with violence. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that peaceful free speech protests are always responded to with violence. Taking space on campus or in a building is not a threat to anyone,\u201d Khan said in a post on X Wednesday. \u201cUCI leadership must do everything they can to avoid creating a violent scenario here. These are your students w/ zero weapons.\u201d The United Auto Workers 4811, which represents 48,000 University of California academic workers, has authorized a strike \u201cif circumstances justify,\u201d citing \u201cnumerous, egregious unfair labor practices committed\u201d during on-campus protests. Specifically, the union mentioned the handling of protests on April 30 and May 1 at the University of California, Los Angeles. The union said in a press release that 19,780 teaching assistants, readers, tutors, student researchers, postdocs and academic researchers at all eleven campuses of the University of California participated in a strike authorization vote, resulting in 79% of participating members voting to authorize the executive board to call a strike if it\u2019s justified. During such a strike, \u201cnot all represented workers are called to go on strike at the same time. Certain campuses may be called to go out on strike at certain times,\u201d the union added. \u201cAt the heart of this is our right to free speech and peaceful protest,\u201d said Rafael Jaime, a graduate worker in the English department and president of UAW 4811.\u00a0\u201cIf members of the academic community are maced and beaten down for peacefully demonstrating on this issue, our ability to speak up on all issues is threatened.\u201d On Friday, the union\u2019s executive board will \u201cevaluate and announce\u201d whether or not they will call on the first campus or campuses to strike, the\u00a0UAW 4811 posted on X.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/us/law-enforcement-detains-protesters-university-of-california-irvine-encampment/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_us_mississippi-aclu-lawsuit-transgender-teen-reaj", "text": "The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and\u00a0ACLU\u00a0of Mississippi\u00a0have filed a\u00a0federal complaint\u00a0against the Harrison County School District on behalf of\u00a0the mother of a transgender teen who\u00a0was forbidden from attending her band concert while wearing a\u00a0dress. The complaint, filed Wednesday with the US Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR), says the school district enforced \u201cdiscriminatory sex-specific dress code policies\u201d that \u201cdisproportionately harms girls, particularly transgender and gender nonconforming girls.\u201d The 16-year-old transgender girl, identified in the complaint as \u201cA.H.,\u201d wears traditionally feminine clothing which is\u00a0\u201ccritically important to A.H.\u2019s sense of self, gender expression,\u00a0and identity as a girl,\u201d according to the complaint. In March, A.H. wore a black dress to a regional band concert evaluation that followed the style and length requirements of the district\u2019s dress code for girls. But, according to the complaint, she was stopped by the school\u2019s principal who told her,\u00a0\u201cBoys can\u2019t wear skirts or dresses\u201d and later said, \u201cYou can\u2019t represent our school dressed like that.\u201d When presented with an ultimatum to have her mother bring \u201cboys\u2019 clothes\u201d or not be allowed to participate, A.H. chose to change into a button-down shirt and dress pants and continue with the concert. \u201cA.H. felt utterly humiliated to be seen in clothing that was inconsistent with her gender identity,\u201d said the complaint. The Harrison County School District enforces a sex-based dress code that requires students to \u201cfollow the dress attire consistent with their biological sex,\u201d according to the district\u2019s student\u00a0handbook. The complaint states the school board added\u00a0the \u201cbiological sex\u201d provision to the dress code during a July 2023 meeting \u201cin response to transgender and gender nonconforming students\u2019 complaints about not being permitted to wear clothing associated with their gender identity and/or expression at school-sponsored events.\u201d Last May, another Mississippi\u00a0transgender teen\u00a0in the same district missed her high school graduation after she was told she had to wear boys\u2019\u00a0clothing to attend, CNN previously reported. That teen went to Harrison Central High School, the same school as A.H., and was allegedly stopped by the same administrator over her clothing.\u00a0A federal judge denied a motion filed by her family, the\u00a0ACLU\u00a0and\u00a0ACLU\u00a0of\u00a0Mississippi\u00a0requesting to allow her to wear a dress and heels. CNN has reached out to the Harrison County School District for comment on the complaint and its accusations. A.H.\u2019s mother also alleges the school district has created a hostile environment for transgender and gender nonconforming students, detailing other instances of tension between students and administrators over the dress code. In one case, a gay cisgender\u00a0student who dresses in masculine-leaning attire, had her senior portrait excluded from the yearbook after wearing a tuxedo, according to the complaint, which cites a separate OCR complaint filed\u00a0by the\u00a0ACLU. Another student was \u201cpulled from the graduation line\u201d before she was set to receive her diploma for wearing black pants under her graduation robe, according to the complaint. \u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned about the discriminatory practices within Harrison County School District that have unfairly targeted my daughter, along with other students. Transgender and gender nonconforming students should not be forced to choose between participating in school events or remaining true to their gender identity,\u201d said A.H.\u2019s mother, Kimberly Hudson, in an\u00a0ACLU\u00a0statement. \u201cWe urge HCSD to take immediate steps to revise its dress code policies and create a more inclusive environment where all students can thrive.\u201d The family also requests the OCR open an investigation into the school district centered on\u00a0Title\u00a0IX,\u00a0which prohibits sex discrimination in any educational program or activity that receives federal financial assistance,\u00a0according to the complaint and\u00a0ACLU\u00a0statement. The landmark federal civil rights law is set to change on August 1. Last month, the Biden administration announced an\u00a0expansion of protections\u00a0for students, including those who\u00a0are LGBTQ+, to prohibit discrimination \u201cbased on sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics in federally funded education programs,\u201d according to a fact sheet shared with CNN. The move\u00a0formalizes a rule the administration previously proposed that would strengthen\u00a0Title\u00a0IX\u00a0protections for transgender students. In Mississippi and in\u00a0other states, LGBTQ+ students are seeing their rights being chipped away. On Monday, Mississippi\u2019s Republican Gov.\u00a0Tate Reeves signed a bill that requires people to use restrooms and housing\u00a0at public education institutions that corresponds to their gender assigned at birth.

{"id": "2024_05_14_us_westminster-dog-show-winner-sage-poodle-cec", "text": "Sage the Miniature Poodle has won best in show at the 2024 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. The all-black ball of fluff claimed the non-sporting group earlier in the event, and cemented herself as a new feminist hero by being the first female Best in Show winner since 2020. Mercedes the German Shepherd, winner of the herding group, claimed second honors of the night as Reserve Best in Show. Poodles have an illustrious record at Westminster. Twelve standard poodles have taken home the top prize over the years. Poodles of all sizes were also one of the most represented breeds at this year\u2019s event, with 43 entrants. However, Sage isn\u2019t just a poodle. She\u2019s a Miniature Poodle, and is the 4th of her kind to claim Westminster\u2019s Best in Show. The Westminster Dog Show has been delighting lovers of finely-groomed pups since 1877, making it the second-oldest continuously held sporting event in the US after the Kentucky Derby. Every year, about 3,000 dogs and their handlers compete in the storied show. The main competition focuses on how well purebred dogs conform to their breed\u2019s standards. Dogs from every background also compete in the Masters Agility Championship and the Masters Obedience Championship. Of course, Best in Show is the real gem of the event. The winning dog is chosen from among seven group winners. Each group comprises breeds with similar traits, like a kind of dog astrology. This years group winners were: Herding group: Mercedes the German Shepherd Hound Group: Louis the Afghan Hound Non-sporting group: Sage the Miniature Poodle Sporting group: Micha the Black Cocker Spaniel Terrier group: Frankie the Bull Terrier (Colored) Toy group: Comet the Shih Tzu Woking group: Monty the Giant Schnauzer Those unfamiliar with the intricacies of fine dog shows may be surprised to know the fate of the Westminster hopefuls rests in just a few hands. Only one judge makes the winning decision for each of the seven groups, culling (figuratively) one top dog from hundreds. Likewise, there is only one judge for Best in Show. This year, the honor went to Kennel Club judge Rosalind Kramer. As the Best in Show judge, Kramer was sequestered before the final round and didn\u2019t know which dogs she would be judging until she stepped into the ring. \u201cThis is the most incredible lineup of dogs, it\u2019s absolutely glorious,\u201d she said before announcing Best in Show. The Westminster Dog Show is also the perfect place to learn fun facts about dogs, like the fact that three US presidents have owned Scottish Terriers or that dogs from Canada hold six Westminster \u201cBest in Show\u201d titles. But not this year. This year, the crown will be worn by a fluffy little lady from Houston, Texas. \u201cNo words, I\u2019m so happy. Exciting,\u201d Sage\u2019s breeder and handler Kaz Hosaka said after the win, in what is his last show after 45 Westminster competitions. \u201cWalked in this ring tonight, she\u2019s kind of not sure, but then she get used to it and then she gave a great performance for me. I\u2019m proud of this dog and thank you very much.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/us/westminster-dog-show-winner-sage-poodle-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_takeaways-trump-trial-michael-cohen-thursday", "text": "Donald Trump attorney Todd Blanche raised his voice and flailed his arms at Michael Cohen, accusing the prosecution\u2019s star witness of making up a phone conversation with Trump just before he sent $130,000 to Stormy Daniels\u2019 attorney in October 2016. Blanche confronted Cohen with text messages he sent with Keith Schiller \u2013 whom Cohen had said put Trump on the phone \u2013 which were unrelated to anything having to do with Trump or Daniels. It was the most dramatic moment of the cross-examination of the key witness in the hush money case, and\u00a0the clearest example yet of the defense\u2019s effort to cast doubt on Cohen\u2019s memory of phone calls and other significant interactions with Trump in 2016. Court is off Friday so Trump can attend the high school graduation of his son, Barron. Cross-examination of Cohen will resume Monday and it\u2019s possible summations could begin as soon as Tuesday. Here are the takeaways from Day 18 of the Trump hush money trial: A heated confrontation over a key phone call It took several hours of cross-examination before Blanche finally turned to the evidence directly related to the case. But it didn\u2019t take long for Blanche to make his biggest rhetorical flourish \u2013 and perhaps his biggest blow to Cohen\u2019s credibility \u2013 of the six-hour cross-cross examination so far, focusing on an October 24, 2016, phone call that Trump\u2019s bodyguard placed to Cohen. Under questioning from prosecutors on Monday, Cohen testified that he was reaching out to Schiller to speak to Trump that day because he needed \u201cto discuss the Stormy Daniels matter and the resolution of it.\u201d But on Thursday, Blanche read Cohen a text that he sent to Schiller minutes before that call: \u201cWho can I speak to regarding harassing calls to my cell and office the dope forgot to block his number.\u201d \u201cCall me,\u201d Blanche said Schiller responded. Blanche says the texts show that at 8:04 p.m. Cohen texted Schiller the phone number of the teenager prank calling him. Blanche used the texts to challenge Cohen\u2019s account of the call. \u201cThat was a lie, you did not talk to President Trump, you talked to Keith Schiller \u2013 you can admit it,\u201d he pressed. Cohen calmly responded, \u201cNo sir, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s accurate.\u201d Cohen said that part of the call was about the prank call, while adding, \u201cI knew that Keith was with Mr. Trump at the time and there was more potentially than this.\u201d Blanche began pacing and waving his arms. His voice raised in volume and tone and he began talking quickly: \u201cBut now your memory is you were testifying truthfully on Tuesday. A 1 minute, 36 second phone call and you had enough time to update Schiller about all the problems you were having and also update President Trump about the status of Stormy Daniels\u2019 situation because you had to keep him informed.\u201d \u201cI always ran everything by the boss immediately, and in this case, it would have been saying everything had been taken care of, it\u2019s been resolved,\u201d Cohen responded. Blanche continued to press on Cohen\u2019s memory. \u201cWas it true for just that phone calls, or was it true for other phone calls too?\u201d \u201cYou just said you don\u2019t recall a phone call back in 2016. That is not what you testified to on Tuesday,\u201d Blanche said, his voice crescendoing to a high-pitch just before the lunch break. In the afternoon, Cohen defended his memory of his calls \u2013 arguing that while he\u2019s had thousands of calls and did not remember all of the circumstances surrounding them, he did remember the details of important ones. \u201cBecause these phone calls are things that I have been talking about for the last six years. They are and they were extremely important and they were all-consuming,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cSo while I did not know that it took place at 8:02 p.m., what I did recall is the conversation that I had had.\u201d Cohen navigates years of inconsistent statements Trump\u2019s lawyer spent hours tediously moving through inconsistent statements that Cohen has made over the years to knock his credibility, although much of the content he was raising had little to do with the issues on trial. Blanche questioned Cohen on myriad of topics, including the recanting of his 2018 guilty plea on tax charges, whether he wanted to work in the White House and what he\u2019s said about a pardon from Trump. Blanche hammered Cohen with repetitive questions about his 2018 guilty plea, which Cohen has since said was in part a lie under oath. Cohen said he\u2019s taken accountability for the charges like tax fraud that he pleaded guilty to at the time, but he says he still blames others and was the victim of a corrupt prosecution. \u201cYou blame a lot of people over the years for the conduct that you were convicted of?\u201d Blanche asked. \u201cI blame people, yes,\u201d Cohen responded. Blanche also challenged Cohen on why federal and state prosecutors never took him on as a cooperator despite his guilty plea to campaign finance charges in connection to the alleged hush money scheme with Daniels. Blanche suggested Cohen was unreliable and only acted like he\u2019d taken accountability for the crimes when he pleaded guilty in order to get a reduced sentence. Cohen pressed on desire for a pardon Blanche also challenged Cohen on his desires to be in Trump\u2019s White House, as revealed in private communications with his daughter and people like Pastor Darrell Scott, who Cohen asked to put in a good word with Trump. Still, Cohen maintained on the stand Thursday that he only ever wanted to be Trump\u2019s personal attorney \u2013 the position he held until he became the subject of a federal investigation. Cohen also conceded on cross-examination that while he testified publicly to Congress that he never asked and would never accept a pardon from Trump, he actually did seek out a pardon from Trump through his attorney and later told lawmakers as much behind closed doors. On the stand, Cohen admitted he explored a pardon with his lawyers because Trump \u201cdangled\u201d the idea of pardoning him and said he \u201cwanted this nightmare to end.\u201d Cohen navigated the confrontation with a cool manner all day but largely told the jury to believe what he says now, not what he\u2019s said in the past, including under oath. Trump perks up for Cohen\u2019s cross For much of the week while Cohen has been on the witness stand, Trump has been taking in the trial with his eyes shut. Trump hardly reacted to Cohen\u2019s testimony during a day-and-a-half of prosecutors\u2019 questions, and he even seemed disinterested during the first half of Blanche\u2019s questioning of him. Trump\u2019s tuned-out body language has appeared to become part of his strategy this trial to not act out as he did previously during the New York civil fraud trial last fall and the E. Jean Carroll defamation case in January. But Trump\u2019s demeanor shifted on Thursday afternoon as the attention turned to Cohen and the media. He sat up in his chair facing directly toward Cohen as Blanche quizzed the witness about his conversations with New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman \u2013 who has come up previously in the trial in the form of a Trump tweet attacking her in 2018. When Cohen told Blanche he has recorded roughly 40 conversations with reporters over the years, Trump turned to his attorney Susan Necheles and they both smirked at the response. As for Cohen, he kept a calm demeanor throughout the testimony, choosing his words carefully and speaking slowly in his answers, even when Blanche\u2019s pacing sped up considerably. Cohen frequently asked Blanche to repeat questions to him, particularly after an objection from prosecutor Susan Hoffinger was overruled by the judge. The contrast of Cohen\u2019s approach to his testimony was on display for the jury when Blanche played a recording of Cohen on his \u201cMea Culpa\u201d podcast from May 30, 2023. The podcast Cohen spoke much more rapidly and with a hefty dose of excitement when discussing the indictment. \u201cI truly f**king hope that this man ends up in prison,\u201d Cohen says on the podcast. \u201cBut revenge is a dish best served cold, and you better believe I want this man to go down and rot inside for what he did to my family.\u201d Trial nearing an end? Before leaving for the weekend, Merchan told the lawyers to be prepared to give summations on Tuesday \u2013 meaning the jury could have the case as early as next week. Prosecutors told Merchan they have no other witnesses to call after Cohen is off the stand, and the defense said it plans to call one campaign finance expert, though that is not set in stone. Blanche said the defense could still choose to call additional witnesses to challenge testimony, and Trump\u2019s team maintains it has not made a decision on whether the former president will testify in his own defense. There\u2019s also the possibility, as CNN has reported, that former Cohen attorney Bob Costello could appear. Costello made an impression during a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing Wednesday where he repeatedly attacked Cohen and said \u201cvirtually every statement\u201d Cohen made on the stand about\u00a0Costello\u00a0was a lie. The other complicating factor is there are only three days of court next week leading up to the Memorial Day holiday. \u201cIt\u2019s not ideal for there to be a big lapse\u201d between summations and when the jury will be given final instructions by the judge before beginning deliberations, Merchan told the lawyers on Thursday. Merchan didn\u2019t say what that would mean for next week\u2019s schedule \u2013 an early start or going later was one option, he suggested \u2013 but it all indicates that the judge believes the jury could end up beginning deliberations next week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/politics/takeaways-trump-trial-michael-cohen-thursday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_investing_dow-40000", "text": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average broke past the 40,000 threshold Thursday for the first time ever, fueled by an encouraging inflation report. The blue-chip index briefly crossed the key threshold in morning trading before falling back below the line in the afternoon to close at 39,869, down 38 points, or 0.1%. All three major indexes closed lower on Thursday. The S&P 500 ended the day down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.3% lower. Markets had rallied to new record highs Wednesday after the latest Consumer Price Index showed a cooldown for the first time in months, stoking hopes that the Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates as soon as September. On a monthly basis, the inflation report showed that prices rose 0.3%, a slower pace than in the two months prior, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists were expecting a 0.4% monthly increase, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Another key data point added to the enthusiasm: April retail sales came in significantly weaker than expected, indicating that consumers are pulling back on the spending that drives the economy. Spending missed the 0.4% increase that economists had projected. \u201cThis is the first good CPI report in four months and the market likes it,\u201d said Gary Pzegeo, head of fixed income at CIBC Private Wealth US. \u201cTaken [together with retail sales] this supports a Fed rate cut in the fall.\u00a0Markets are discounting a cut in September and have moved to price in a second cut by December.\u201d President Joe Biden celebrated the move Thursday. \u201cThis is great news for Americans\u2019 retirement accounts and another sign of confidence in America\u2019s economy,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI\u2019m building an economy from the middle out and bottom up \u2014 and our investments are making a difference.\u201d Main Street vs. Wall Street The new record for the Dow, made of 30 blue-chip stocks, marks a symbolic shift for investors who \u2014 despite elevated interest and inflation rates, geopolitical strife and years of recession warnings \u2014 still feel good about the US economy. It also highlights a notable contrast between sentiment on Wall Street and Main Street. Consumer sentiment plunged to the lowest level in six months as price increases reaccelerated, according to a University of Michigan survey of consumers released earlier this month. The recent inflation crisis has given Americans angst about the economy, and recent CNN polls show that many people believe the US economy is headed in the wrong direction. Some even believe the United States is currently in a recession, although there\u2019s no evidence of that. Overall, 26% of Americans currently say that economic conditions have stabilized, according to CNN data from February. Nearly half of Americans say they believe the economy remains in a downturn. The first three months of 2024 brought remarkable market momentum. The S&P 500 hit 22 new records between January 1 and April. But, since then, markets have become volatile, as investors began to fear that inflation and interest rates would remain higher for longer. Wednesday\u2019s CPI report changed that perception. \u201cThis was a good report in the context of three hotter-than-expected [CPI] reports, and it makes it look like potentially those were bumps in the road rather than a really stagnant inflation environment,\u201d Tyler Schipper, economics professor at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota, told CNN in an interview. Crossing 40,000 Crossing the 40,000 level doesn\u2019t hold much practical value for investors, but it does catch the attention of the public and, some argue, it could help propel that optimistic sentiment beyond Wall Street. \u201cThe Dow 40,000 milestone also shows how resilient the US economy has been, at a time where there was a plethora of calls for a recession,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial, in a recent note to CNN. \u201cThe overarching importance of crossing these big round numbers is that it brings Wall Street news to Main Street, at least for a day. It also serves as an affirmation that corporate earnings are growing, and that investor confidence remains robust,\u201d he said. To many Americans, \u201cthe Dow\u201d simply means the stock market. The index\u2019s small cache of stocks \u2014 ranging from Microsoft to McDonald\u2019s to Chevron \u2014 represents some of the largest companies in the nation and are widely held among retail and institutional investors alike. A look back Here are some important stops along the Dow\u2019s road to 40,000: Dow is formed: The first daily close, on May 26, 1896, was 40.94. The Dow did not get off to a good start, plunging 30% to an all-time low of 28.48 by August that year. Dow 100: The Dow first closed in triple digits in January 1906. That marked an impressive rally for the average, which had hit an all-time low when Teddy Roosevelt was president. The Federal Reserve would not be created for seven more years. Crash of 1929: The Dow fell 38 points on Oct. 28 and 31 more points the next day. That might not sound bad today, but it represented back-to-back declines of 13% and 12% of the Dow\u2019s value. They are still two of the worst one-day percentage declines in the index\u2019s history. Dow 1,000: Nov. 14, 1972. Richard Nixon had just won reelection by taking 49 states. The Dow\u2019s components, which had been unchanged for 13 years, included Woolworth, Eastman Kodak and International Nickel. Crash of 1987: On Oct. 19, the Dow plunged 508 points, a 23% drop that is still the largest one-day percentage decline in history. A week later it took an 8% plunge. But the damage was short-lived: Within a year, the Dow was back to pre-crash levels. Dow 10,000: March 29, 1999. The \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d of the tech bubble was in full swing as the Dow gained 1,000 points in less than a year to hit this benchmark. It gained 1,000 more points in just the next month. A year later, the dot-com stock bubble burst, sending the Dow down nearly 30% by September 2001. Meltdown of 2008-2009: The financial crisis caused the Dow to lose about half its value in less than a year, bottoming out to close at 6,547 on March 9, 2009. The worst day was Sept. 29, 2008, when the Dow lost what was then a record 778 points after Congress rejected a $700 billion bank bailout. The bailout was later approved. Dow 15,000: May 7, 2013. As the economy continued to recover from the Great Recession, the Dow had one of the current bull market\u2019s strongest periods. It crossed the 15,000 mark and finished the year up 26.5%, marking the best full-year performance of the current bull market. The Dow nearly matched that in 2017, rising 25%. Dow 20,000: January 25, 2017. The stock market had enjoyed a nice run starting on the day after the 2016 election, with the Dow gaining nearly 10% as investors looked forward to lower taxes and less regulation under the Trump administration. Dow 25,000: Jan. 4, 2018. The passage of the Trump tax cuts, especially the lowering of the corporate tax rate in December 2017, helped feed the quick move between 20,000 and 25,000. Dow 30,000: Nov. 24, 2020: Covid sent the stock market plunging in the spring of 2020. But new hopes of a vaccine and the results of the presidential election ended an era of uncertainty on Wall Street, sending the stock market rolling once again.

{"id": "2024_05_14_us_baltimore-bridge-collapse-ntsb-report", "text": "The cargo ship Dali that crashed into Baltimore\u2019s Key Bridge in March had a pair of catastrophic electrical failures minutes before the crash and had experienced two blackouts a day earlier, according to a preliminary report released Tuesday by the National Transportation Safety Board. The 24-page report details investigators\u2019 early factual findings on the March 26 disaster that took down the 1.6-mile long steel structure, killing six construction workers on the bridge and severing access to critical shipping routes in and out of the Port of Baltimore. According to the report, the two power outages occurred three ships\u2019 lengths from the bridge and were\u00a0triggered by the tripping of two critical circuit breakers, which\u00a0caused several pumps required for the ship\u2019s single propeller and its single rudder to stop working. The emergency generator was not configured to power the ship, the report said. The ship at the time of the failure was under the control of an apprentice pilot, who was accompanied by a senior pilot. When the pilots boarded, the captain reported the ship was in good working order, according to the report. NTSB investigators said the crewmembers tested negative for drugs and alcohol, and the fuel tested negative for contaminants three times. About 10 hours earlier, while the ship was still moored in the Port of Baltimore, it experienced two onboard blackouts, one caused by a crew error, according to the report. \u201cThe NTSB is still investigating the electrical configuration following the first in-port blackout and potential impacts on the events during the accident voyage,\u201d the report states. The FBI and Coast Guard are looking into whether the crew failed to report the\u00a0in-port power outage as part of a criminal investigation, according to a US official familiar with the matter. An NTSB preliminary report does not conclude a probable cause. Those findings will be part of a final report that could take investigators up to two years to complete. The report notes several areas that are still being investigated, including \u201cthe design and operation of the Dali\u2019s power distribution system (including its breakers).\u201d The report took 49 days to publish, longer than the typical month it takes for the agency\u2019s investigators to publish such a report. On Wednesday, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy will testify on the bridge collapse before the House Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure. Other witnesses include officials from the US Coast Guard and the Army Corps of Engineers.  6 workers died, and others narrowly escaped The ship, weighing about 213 million pounds, had lost engine and electrical power shortly before hitting the bridge, officials said. Video footage from moments before the crash showed plumes of black smoke coming from the vessel as well as the lights flickering on and off, likely due to an emergency generator activating after an initial blackout. Six construction workers\u00a0who were filling potholes on the bridge were killed in the disaster. The victims were immigrants from El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras who worked to support their families. The NTSB report details the near-catastrophic experiences of a crew member on the ship and a road maintenance inspector on the bridge. The crew member was on the bow of the ship at the time of the crash. \u201c(He) told investigators that, as he was releasing the brake on the port anchor, he had to escape from the falling bridge before he was able to reapply the brake,\u201d the report states. The inspector on the bridge had been walking the span when the ship struck. \u201cHe ran north and made it to the nearest surviving span before the rest of the bridge collapsed,\u201d the report states. The bridge\u2019s collapse also has strangled the regional infrastructure. The wreckage of the bridge has clogged the port, a major shipping channel for the sugar and automotive industries. In addition, the Key Bridge was a critical thoroughfare, with 30,000 commuters relying on it every day, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said. Officials have vowed to rebuild the bridge \u2013 but the exact cost remains unclear. A spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute has estimated the bridge alone could be worth more than $1.2 billion. President Joe Biden has said he\u2019s committed to helping rebuild the bridge as soon as possible and said the federal government will bear the costs. Multiple investigations are underway to try to determine who might be responsible for the catastrophe. Last month, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott announced a probe \u201cto hold the wrongdoers responsible and to mitigate the immediate and long-term harm\u201d to residents. The ship\u2019s Singaporean owner, Grace Ocean Private Limited, and manager, Synergy Marine PTE LTD, filed a petition in federal court last month asking for a $43.6 million limit on potential liability payouts. The city of Baltimore has asked the court to deny that request. It also filed a legal claim against Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine, accusing both companies of having an \u201cincompetent crew\u201d aboard the Dali that lacked proper skill and training, Darrell Wilson, a spokesperson for the ship\u2019s owner and manager, declined to comment to CNN \u201cout of respect for the ongoing investigations and any future legal proceedings.\u201d This is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/us/baltimore-bridge-collapse-ntsb-report/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_05_16_business_dow-40000-history-nightcap", "text": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is, at best, an imperfect barometer of stock market activity among a narrow band of very large US companies. It\u2019s clunky, and too limited in scope for any Wall Street pros to pay serious attention to it. Nevertheless, the Dow persists. When the Dow hit the 40,000 mark on Thursday, the news was splashed across most major TV news chyrons and websites, that comforting whole number telling the world that something good is happening. Maybe you\u2019re not quite sure what it means. But you know it\u2019s up, and up is better than down. \u201cMention \u2018the Dow\u2019 and, to most people, that means the stock market,\u201d said market strategist Art Hogan. \u201cThe Dow Jones industrial average is an instant way of telling the world which way the market is moving, even if the average isn\u2019t an accurate measure of the thousands of stocks listed on the nation\u2019s exchanges.\u201d While most professional investors look at the S&P 500 \u2014 a much broader measure of what\u2019s happening on Wall Street \u2014 everyday Americans look to the Dow. The number of Google searches for \u201cDow Jones\u201d is always higher than the searches for \u201cS&P 500,\u201d\u00a0said Nick Colas, co-founder of market research firm DataTrek. \u201cIf you\u2019re not an investor, you know that a rising stock market means the economy is decent, and you probably have less of a chance of being laid off,\u201d Colas said. There\u2019s nothing magical about the Dow. It\u2019s just an index that tracks the stock market activity of 30 large US companies, from Amazon to McDonald\u2019s to the Walt Disney Company. But it is very old, and that\u2019s partly why it sticks around. \u201cThe Dow is, no doubt, an anachronistic index,\u201d says Daniel Alpert, managing partner of\u00a0Westwood Capital. \u201cIts primary benefit is that it goes back forever.\u201d Deep roots If you wanted to peek at what stocks were doing in the days leading up to the October 1929 crash, the Dow is the only index that has that information preserved in amber. You can trace the Dow back to the 1890s, whereas the S&P 500 wasn\u2019t created until 1957, well after the economic upheaval of World War II. The Dow serves as a running history of the US economy, like those charts that show the evolution of humans from Neanderthal to homo sapien. You can track the rise and fall of heavy industry and the emergence of Silicon Valley through changes in the Dow\u2019s composition, which was once dominated by the likes of Standard Oil and US Steel. These days, UnitedHealth, Microsoft and Goldman Sachs are the Dow heavyweights. Weird weighting Serious traders sometimes look down their nose at the Dow because of the way it ranks companies by share price, rather than by market capitalization, like the S&P 500 does. Market capitalization measures the total value of a company on the stock market. In the Dow, a smaller company with less relevance to the economy can outweigh a bigger company. In its current iteration, for example, the Dow deems Goldman Sachs \u2014 a Wall Street bank with almost no consumer-facing business, valued at about $125 billion \u2014 more important than Apple, a nearly $3 trillion tech behemoth with a billion customers. The way the points work: You take the price of one share of each of the 30 companies, add those up and divide by the \u201cDow divisor,\u201d a constant figure that helps account for fluctuations in the market. Explaining the weird logic of the Dow, Colas told me: \u201cIf somebody asks you how your kids are, what you do is you add up their ages. I\u2019ve got a 10, 5 and 3 year old \u2014 I\u2019m an 18 \u2026 A higher number doesn\u2019t really tell you anything, but it\u2019s like, OK, my kids are getting older.\u201d Despite its flaws, the Dow is a strong brand that\u2019s been embedded in the American psyche. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly imperfect index,\u201d Alpert says. \u201cBut it\u2019s the word that, in the shortest possible number of letters, describes Wall Street.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/business/dow-40000-history-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_us_loay-alnaji-paul-kessler-death-will-stand-trial", "text": "A man charged with manslaughter in the death of a Jewish protester he\u2019s accused of striking during dueling demonstrations over the Israel-Hamas war last year will stand trial, a judge ruled Wednesday, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors allege Loay Alnaji hit the 69-year-old protester, Paul Kessler, with a megaphone before Kessler fell and struck his head on the pavement of a street corner in Thousand Oaks, California, in November, the Ventura County District Attorney\u2019s Office said in a release. Kessler, who was demonstrating in support of Israel, later died at a hospital. Medical examiners determined he died from blunt force trauma caused by the blow from the megaphone and his fall, prosecutors said. Alnaji is facing involuntary manslaughter and battery charges after an investigation police say was complicated by conflicting statements from pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian witnesses. He has pleaded not guilty, the district attorney\u2019s office said last year. The tense confrontation happened during one of many protests sweeping US cities in the weeks after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing an estimated 1,200 people and kidnapping about 200 others. Israel\u2019s ongoing military response in Gaza has so far killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to the Ministry of Health in\u00a0Gaza, and is fueling a worsening humanitarian crisis. During a two-day hearing, prosecutors presented evidence against Alnaji, including DNA analysis of blood on the megaphone, which matches Kessler, and video and audio taken on Kessler\u2019s phone in the moments leading to his fall, the district attorney\u2019s office said. Prosecutors have yet to find evidence to indicate Alnaji committed a hate crime, the release said. \u201cWhile antisemitic hate speech was heard at the November 5, 2023, rally, there is no evidence those words were said by\u00a0Alnaji,\u201d the release said. Alnaji\u2019s attorney, Ron Bamieh, told CNN his client was acting in self-defense during an altercation with the victim and said witness accounts of the incident have been \u201cinconsistent or inaccurate.\u201d \u201cThis case is a simple question of whether or not my client had the right to swat Mr.\u00a0Kessler\u2019s phone away, and as a result, hit him in the face in self-defense,\u201d Bamieh said. In November, Bamieh told CNN Kessler stuck his phone in Alnaji\u2019s face and he \u201cbrushed\u201d it away. \u201cWhen (Kessler) fell, my client is seen on the video 6 to 8 feet away from him,\u201d he added. The attorney said previously Alnaji \u201cfully cooperated with law enforcement, attempted to aid Mr. Kessler when he fell, and called 911 when he realized that Mr. Kessler was injured.\u201d While Bamieh concedes Alnaji struck the victim during the heated confrontation, he argued prosecutors were \u201caggressive\u201d in filing the case the way they did. \u201cThe prosecution is treating this as more of a publicity case and a political case than an actual criminal case.\u201d A spokesperson for the district attorney\u2019s office, Joey Buttitta, told CNN, \u201cWe pursue truth and justice based on the facts and the evidence, not politics and publicity.\u201d After he was charged, Alnaji was placed on administrative leave from his job in the Ventura County Community College District, which includes three colleges, the district said at the time. He worked at Moorpark College,\u00a0The Los Angeles Times\u00a0reported. Alnaji\u00a0is out on $50,000 bail and is scheduled for an arraignment on June 10, the district attorney\u2019s office said. He faces a maximum of four years in prison if convicted. What investigators said happened at the dueling rallies The incident took place while simultaneous rallies were being\u00a0held by two groups\u00a0identified as \u201cFreedom for Palestine\u201d and \u201cWe are Pro-Israel,\u201d according to the Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Authorities estimated between 75 and 100 people were present. Around 3:20 p.m. on November 5, the sheriff\u2019s office received multiple calls about a possible assault related to the protests at an intersection, Sheriff Jim Fryhoff has said. When deputies and medical responders arrived at the scene minutes later, they found Kessler lying on the ground, conscious and responsive, the sheriff said. Investigators determined a pro-Palestinian protester, later identified as Alnaji, had been involved in an altercation with Kessler, who at some point fell backward and hit his head on the ground, authorities said. Pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian witnesses at the scene gave contradicting accounts of who the aggressor was and how the altercation occurred, the sheriff said. A 50-year-old suspect was also interviewed at the scene, where he told deputies he had been involved in an altercation with Kessler, Fryhoff said. His home was searched by investigators the next day, the sheriff said. Authorities did not say at the time whether that suspect was Alnaji. Kessler was hospitalized in critical condition before dying from his injuries. In addition to determining his cause of death to be blunt force trauma, an autopsy revealed Kessler suffered injuries consistent with a fall, including skull fractures, brain swelling and bruising, and nonlethal injuries to his face, according to Dr. Christopher Young, Ventura County\u2019s chief medical examiner. The district attorney described Kessler as a father of one who had been married for 43 years. He worked in medical sales for \u201ca number of decades\u201d and also taught sales and marketing.

{"id": "2024_05_16_us_university-of-washington-protests-antisemitic-graffiti", "text": "Pro-Palestinian encampments have been cleared from more US college campuses as school officials have called in law enforcement in recent weeks to quell mounting demonstrations\u00a0over the institutions\u2019 ties to Israel amid its\u00a0military action in Gaza. Here are the latest developments: Arts and sciences faculty at Columbia University have passed a vote of no confidence in the Ivy League school\u2019s president, Minouche Shafik, who has been under intense scrutiny for her handling of campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war and her congressional testimony on the subject. Sixty-five percent of participants said they had no confidence in Shafik, a spokesperson for the New York university confirmed to CNN on Thursday, adding some 900 of its 4,600 full-time faculty voted. Among their concerns were that Shafik\u2019s leadership had \u201cnot only endangered our students; more broadly, it represents a serious threat to the core values of the university: academic freedom, shared governance, freedom of expression, and the right to peaceful assembly,\u201d the Barnard College and Columbia University Chapters of the American Association of University Professors said in a Thursday news release. Shafik \u201ccontinues to consult regularly with members of the community, including faculty, administration, and trustees, as well as with state, city, and community leaders,\u201d Columbia spokesperson Ben Chang said in a statement. Shafik a day earlier sent a message to graduates \u2013 after their university-wide commencement ceremony was canceled following weeks of Gaza war protests \u2013 wishing \u201cthat the challenges you faced during this difficult era will inspire you and make you stronger.\u201d \u201cI know that the last few weeks have been very difficult,\u00a0and\u00a0I am sorry that we were unable to celebrate your commencement in the traditional manner,\u201d she said in her message. Columbia cited security concerns in canceling the large event, a school official told CNN, and instead is holding smaller ones. Acknowledging \u201can extraordinary and tragic set of events\u201d in the Middle East and that \u201cas a great\u00a0university, we must engage with these issues,\u201d the polarization\u00a0at Columbia has caused conflict\u00a0on\u00a0campus, Shafik said. \u201cCanceling the traditional\u00a0commencement\u00a0ceremony was\u00a0one of the toughest calls in a year of many tough calls,\u201d Shafik wrote in an op-ed in the\u00a0Columbia\u00a0Daily Spectator, noting her top priority has been the safety of students, faculty and staff. \u201cThe conflict between the rights of pro-Palestinian protesters and the impact that their protests have had\u00a0on\u00a0some members of our Jewish community is what makes this moment singularly fraught,\u201d she said. UC Irvine goes remote as 50 protesters detained: Classes at the University of California, Irvine, are remote Thursday after law enforcement personnel used zip ties to restrain demonstrators the prior evening at the university before escorting them\u00a0away from a pro-Palestinian protest encampment and toward a parking lot.  University spokesperson Tom Vasich said 47 people were arrested, including 26 students, two employees and 19 other individuals. Those who were arrested were taken to the Orange County Jail, where booking and processing were completed. \u201cThey were then released on citation,\u201d Vasich said. Vasich had earlier told CNN 50 people were arrested, but revised the number to 47 later Thursday. Most of those taken into custody were cited for failure to disperse after a direct police order and a few were arrested for trespassing, Vasich said, adding a full breakdown of how many of those arrested are students or faculty is expected to be released later on Thursday. \u201cA group of several hundred protestors entered the UC Irvine campus and began surrounding\u201d the school\u2019s Physical Sciences Lecture Hall at\u00a0around 2:30 p.m., Wednesday, the school said in an emergency update. The\u00a0university\u00a0put out a mutual aid call to local law\u00a0enforcement\u00a0and got help from the\u00a0Irvine\u00a0Police Department and Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department, it said. Authorities cleared\u00a0what looked like at least half\u00a0of student protesters at\u00a0the encampment, aerial footage from\u00a0CNN affiliate KABC\u00a0showed. Pro-Palestinian protesters had set up a campus encampment on April 29, when the university also\u00a0called in\u00a0local law enforcement. Days later, the school\u2019s chancellor said the university would continue to negotiate with student protesters demanding their university cut financial ties to Israel over the nation\u2019s military action in Gaza. UC Berkeley condemned building occupied by Pro-Palestinian protesters: Protesters are still occupying a condemned building at the University of California, Berkeley, a school spokesperson said Thursday, after a group broke in the prior afternoon with sticks and bolt cutters, broke windows and spray-painted walls, police said. \u201cThere is an active crime scene at a building in the Anna Head complex,\u201d spokesperson Dan Mogulof told CNN via email. \u201cThis is not nonviolent civil disobedience.\u201d A Palestinian flag is hanging from the building, where protesters set up tents, footage from CNN affiliate KGO shows. Images from the Jewish Community Relations Council\u00a0Bay Area show the building\u2019s interior walls covered in what the group called \u201cantisemitic graffiti,\u201d reading, \u201cZionism is Nazism\u201d and \u201cMartyrs never die.\u201d \u201cThe Star of David, the most recognizable symbol in Judaism, is seen equated with a swastika,\u201d the council said Wednesday in an X post. \u201cThis is not protest, this is pure hate.\u201d The building\u2019s takeover came a day after the UCB Divest Coalition\u00a0agreed to end its campus encampment following discussions with university leadership. The coalition did not initiate the break-in at the Anna Head complex, Mogulof said. UC Berkeley\u2019s chancellor was relieved to bring the encampment protests to a peaceful end, noting the school\u2019s leadership does not support full divestment from Israel at this time, she said. \u201cThe sale of direct investments is not within the authority of the Office of the Chancellor but rather lies with the UC Regents,\u201d Carol Christ wrote Tuesday in a letter\u00a0to the Free Palestine Encampment. If all divestment demands by students were met, the University of California system would have to sell $32 billion of its $175 billion portfolio, UC\u2019s Chief Investment Officer Jagdeep Singh Bachher said Tuesday during an Investments Committee meeting held as part of this week\u2019s monthly UC Board of Regents meeting at its Merced campus. University of Washington president calls for encampment break-up as antisemitic graffiti found on campus: After\u00a0protests escalated at the University of\u00a0Washington\u00a0\u2013 with \u201coffensive\u00a0graffiti\u00a0across multiple\u00a0buildings\u00a0all\u00a0over\u00a0campus, some quite clearly both antisemitic\u00a0and\u00a0violent\u201d \u2013 the school\u2019s president is calling again for the voluntary dismantling\u00a0of\u00a0a pro-Palestinian encampment on\u00a0the Seattle campus. Students and faculty on Wednesday discovered the graffiti, which has \u201ccreat(ed) an unwelcome\u00a0and fearful environment for many students, faculty\u00a0and staff, especially those who are Jewish,\u201d President Ana Mari Cauce said later that day in a statement, calling the situation \u201cuntenable.\u201d Cauce asked for the tent camp to break up, echoing her entreaty last week to demonstrators \u201cto dismantle the encampment\u00a0voluntarily for everyone\u2019s safety.\u201d \u201cMuch to my dismay, given the relatively cordial tone\u00a0of\u00a0many\u00a0of\u00a0our discussions, the representatives also said the new\u00a0graffiti\u00a0is an intentional escalation to compel the\u00a0University\u00a0to agree to their demands,\u201d she said Wednesday, adding university officials \u201chave engaged sincerely\u00a0and\u00a0openly.\u201d Among protesters\u2019 \u201cescalating demands\u201d is \u201ca new department that would have an \u2018anti-Zionist\u2019 litmus test for faculty hiring,\u201d Cauce said in the statement. \u201cMany\u00a0of\u00a0these demands, especially the most recent, are contrary to academic freedom\u00a0and/or to state or federal law.\u201d \u201cWhile I strongly support free speech\u00a0and\u00a0peaceful\u00a0protest, I also strongly support the rights\u00a0of\u00a0all\u00a0our community members to live, learn\u00a0and\u00a0work without fear,\u201d she\u00a0said. \u201cThe\u00a0University\u2019s response to students\u2019\u00a0calls\u00a0for change will not be based on an encampment.\u201d DePaul\u00a0University protest\u00a0encampment removed by police: Police in riot gear moved protesters away and dismantled tents Thursday morning at a pro-Palestinian protest encampment at DePaul University in Chicago, video from\u00a0CNN affiliate WLS\u00a0shows.  Two protesters accused of blocking nearby traffic were arrested, school spokesperson Russell Dorn told CNN, adding no arrests were made in the campus quad. The decision to dismantle the encampment came after \u201cgood faith efforts\u201d to negotiate with organizers, DePaul President Robert Manuel said. \u201cFrom the beginning of the\u00a0encampment, I have said that\u00a0we would protect free speech and the ability to dissent until it either prevented us from carrying out the operations of our university or threatened the safety of the members of our community,\u201d Manuel\u00a0said\u00a0in an open letter to students and employees. \u201cI am deeply saddened to say the encampment has crossed that\u00a0line.\u201d University buildings have been vandalized with graffiti, and the cost to repair the physical damage to the quad, which will be \u201cclosed to everyone\u201d until further notice, appears to be nearly $180,000, Manuel said in his letter. The DePaul Divestment Coalition \u2013 a multiethnic, multifaith student group \u2013 has been calling on DePaul to \u201cdivest from killing and harm abroad\u201d since its encampment was set up April 30. \u201cDePaul\u2019s administration chose to use violence to disperse the encampment and unilaterally withdrew from negotiations,\u201d Benjamin Meyer, an attorney representing the coalition said. \u201cThe students sent administration a calendar invite for a meeting on Monday, in which none of the administrators attended.\u201d Morehouse College could stop graduation if Biden\u2019s speech is disrupted: Morehouse College\u2019s president has vowed to combat any disruptive behavior during President Joe Biden\u2019s scheduled graduation speech Sunday at the preeminent historically Black institution by shutting down commencement \u201con the spot.\u201d \u201cSo, for example, prolonged shouting down of the president as he speaks,\u201d Morehouse College President David A. Thomas told CNN\u2019s Victor Blackwell on Thursday.\u00a0\u201cI have also made a decision that we will also not ask police to take individuals out of commencement in zip ties. \u201cIf faced with the choice, I will cease the ceremonies on the spot if we were to reach that position.\u201d Biden\u2019s visit to the Atlanta campus approaches as he seeks to convince young voters to send him to the White House for another term, even as many have expressed frustration for his administration\u2019s continued support of Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment. This is a developing story and will be updated.

{"id": "2024_05_11_us_rutgers-phd-student-dissertation-birth", "text": "In late March, Tamiah Brevard-Rodriguez had a plan leading up to her April 24 due date. Coined \u201cOperation Dissertation Before Baby,\u201d the plan included Brevard-Rodriguez completing her dissertation and having her baby in time to celebrate graduation and the summer with family. In that order. Brevard-Rodriguez\u2019s dissertation presentation \u2013 for her doctorate at Rutgers Graduate School of Education \u2013 focused on the beauty pressures placed on Black college women while enrolled at predominantly White educational institutions. But while she was in the middle of fine-tuning the dissertation early on March 25, things went decidedly off-plan. After working for a few hours and lying down to get some rest, Brevard-Rodriguez\u2019s water broke. While this was a happy moment, she was scheduled to deliver her dissertation that very day. Tamiah\u2019s wife, Alyza Brevard-Rodriguez, tried to calm her. \u201cI\u2019ve witnessed her work so hard, tirelessly working on the presentation, a six-year program, a two-year study.\u00a0I\u2019m just like, \u2018don\u2019t let today be the day,\u2019\u201d Alyza told CNN. \u201cI walk into the bathroom and I look at her and she is just shaking in tears. As much as I knew that this was a happy moment for the both of us, I can see the sadness on her that you know her day was possibly going to be ruined.\u201d They were planning to go to a birthing center, but their doula told them to get to the hospital quickly. Alyza helped Tamiah to the car and they sped down the highway in the dark, in what Alyza called a \u201crace to the finish line.\u201d When Tamiah started to go into labor, Alyza worried they wouldn\u2019t make it to the hospital in time for the baby\u2019s birth. They didn\u2019t. Tamiah had given birth in the car. \u201cWhen I looked over, she had the baby in her left hand and the umbilical cord in her right,\u201d Alyza said. They got to the hospital with baby Enzo. Doctors and nurses checked him out and cut his umbilical cord, joking that Tamiah \u201cdid all the hard work for us.\u201d Now was the time to rest, but Tamiah still had a dissertation to present. Alyza discussed possibly rescheduling the meeting with Tamiah\u2019s mentor. However, Tamiah worried if they rescheduled, it wouldn\u2019t happen in the time frame needed to graduate this year. \u201cAs I was laying there, I was just thinking to myself, \u2018I can do it,\u2019\u201d Tamiah recalled.\u00a0\u201cThe baby\u2019s here. Let\u2019s just get this over with.\u201d And so she did. Alyza brought her clothes, laptop and a makeup bag. \u201cI took a nap, ate a meal and then I was ready to rock and roll,\u201d Tamiah said. As she logged onto her laptop from her hospital bed, the only person who knew about her delivery earlier that morning was her mentor.\u00a0He didn\u2019t want anyone to give her sympathy, so he kept quiet. For about twenty to thirty minutes, she gave a stellar presentation, Tamiah says. With the presentation over, she took down her Rutgers background on Zoom, revealing the hospital. \u201cEveryone was in complete shock,\u201d Tamiah said. Tamiah\u2019s graduation ceremony is this Sunday, on Mother\u2019s Day. She says she will celebrate with a dinner with family and friends. Alyza also finished her doctorate recently, and their daughter Aubriel is soon graduating from preschool. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to uplift women and show how incredibly powerful they are,\u201d Alyza said. \u201cI hope that people really take away from this that women are strong and resilient, tenacious, ambitious grit and they can do anything.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/us/rutgers-phd-student-dissertation-birth/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_business_royal-mail-takeover-daniel-kretinsky", "text": "Royal Mail dates back to the Tudors. It has been operating a postal service in England since the reign of Henry VIII. Now this most British of institutions is on the brink of being sold to a Czech billionaire, Daniel K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd, raising fears about the fate of thousands of workers and a key national service. British logistics company International Distribution Services (IDS), which owns the loss-making postal service, said Wednesday that it was \u201cminded to recommend\u201d to its shareholders a \u00a33.70-per-share ($4.69) takeover offer from K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd\u2019s EP Group. EP Group has until May 29 to convert its \u00a33.5 billion ($4.4 billion) non-biding offer into a formal bid for IDS. The likely sale would come after a difficult few years for Royal Mail, which was privatized in 2013. It has suffered a sharp drop in demand for its services, and losses have ballooned. Appeals to the government to be released from its obligation to deliver letters six days a week have fallen on deaf ears. A spokesperson for the UK Department for Business and Trade told CNN that it had \u201cno current plans\u201d to change Royal Mail\u2019s legally binding service obligations. \u201cAny future changes to Royal Mail\u2019s operation will need to take into account the impacts on businesses and vulnerable consumers who rely on this vital service,\u201d the spokesperson said. So who is the white knight ready to take on a company that, during the last financial year, was losing \u00a38 million ($10 million) a week? The \u2018Czech Sphinx\u2019 K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd is a Czech national who has made his fortune through a sprawling empire of European energy companies, retailers and football clubs. He is worth an estimated $7.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The 49-year-old magnate began his career as a lawyer, before moving to a Czech investment bank, where he became a partner in 2003, according to EP Group\u2019s website. A few years later, K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd co-founded Energetick\u00fd a pr\u016fmyslov\u00fd holding, or EPH, which owns European gas- and coal-fired power plants, commodities trading firms and freight companies, its website shows. In 2016, the billionaire founded EP Group with business partner Patrik Tk\u00e1\u010d. Through its investment arm Vesa Equity Investment, K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd has acquired stakes in big-name brands such as Foot Locker (FL) in the United States, FNAC in France, and supermarket Sainsbury\u2019s in the United Kingdom. He has come to be known as a mysterious personality given his reluctance to speak publicly about his business dealings. So elusive, in fact, that the Polish version of Newsweek magazine dubbed him the \u201cCzech Sphinx\u201d in 2019. The Sphinx, a mythical creature originating in Greek mythology, requires travelers to solve a riddle before allowing them to pass. But some fans of British soccer will already know his name. Three years ago, the businessman bought a 27% stake in West Ham United Football Club through another of his investment firms. That makes K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd the club\u2019s second-biggest shareholder, according its website. \u2018As British as it gets\u2019 The potential buyout of Royal Mail has stirred anxieties about the consequences of the iconic British institution coming under foreign ownership. Reuters reported Thursday, citing a spokesperson for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, that UK business minister Kemi Badenoch was expected to meet with IDS to discuss the takeover bid. Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, which represents about 110,000 Royal Mail workers, said the potential takeover by K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd\u2019s investment firm posed a \u201cthreat\u201d to the future of postal services in the UK. He asked that EP Group \u201cimmediately demonstrate\u201d a commitment to working with the CWU and rule out any potential break-up of Royal Mail or diminishment of its workers\u2019 pension pots. \u201cIt cannot be right that a key part of national infrastructure is allowed to be owned by individuals or companies who have no vision for the future and no clear plan to put the workforce at the heart of turning Royal Mail around,\u201d Ward said in a statement Wednesday. Jonathan Reynolds, business spokesperson for the UK\u2019s opposition Labour Party, urged EP Group in a letter to provide \u201ccast-iron guarantees\u201d that it would keep Royal Mail\u2019s headquarters in the UK, and would work closely with its labor union. \u201cRoyal Mail is as British as it gets, and Labour will take the necessary steps to safeguard its undeniable identity and place in public life,\u201d he wrote in the letter, which he posted on X. In a statement last month, EP Group said it was \u201ca committed long-term investor in the UK\u201d and believed that private investment in Royal Mail was \u201ccrucial\u201d as the service faced escalating competition with multinational companies in the UK postal market. \u201cRoyal Mail is an important national asset that would benefit from being able to take a longer-term view,\u201d the firm said. \u201c(EP Group) is prepared to support this iconic business as it transforms and rebuilds into a modern postal operator delivering high-quality service to its customers, stability to its workforce and sustainable financial performance.\u201d Ivana Kottasov\u00e1 contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/business/royal-mail-takeover-daniel-kretinsky/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "us"}}

Ephraim Matthew Hunter, 29, faces felony counts of burglary and vandalism after allegedly smashing a rear glass door at the mayor\u2019s home, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office. But in an interview with KNX News published Monday, Hunter said he had been on a multi-day drug binge and wasn\u2019t targeting the mayor, but was running from someone he thought had been chasing him. When\u00a0charges were filed\u00a0against Hunter in April, Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said officials believed \u201che was targeting the mayor\u201d but did not offer a potential motive. \u201cThere were actions while he was inside the property that are consistent with the fact that he knew that this was the mayor\u2019s home and that he was looking for her,\u201d the district attorney said. A criminal complaint alleges Hunter entered the home \u201cwith the intent to commit larceny and any felony.\u201d Hunter\u2019s attorney, Howard Stern, told CNN in an email on Tuesday: \u201cThe DA\u2019s Office has this case wrong.\u201d When asked to elaborate on Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s comments and provide an update on the investigation on Tuesday, the district attorney\u2019s office said they could not provide information regarding evidence in the case since the investigation is ongoing. A Los Angeles Police Department source described as \u201ca high-ranking official,\u201d told the Los Angeles Times: \u201cI don\u2019t know why Gasc\u00f3n said what he said, he must be privy to something our investigators are not privy to.\u201d The newspaper also spoke with another law enforcement source who said responding officers believed Hunter was under the influence of methamphetamine. Shortly after Hunter was charged, a woman identifying herself as his mother told the LA Times he didn\u2019t know whose home he had entered. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know that at all,\u201d Josephine Duah told the newspaper. \u201cHe just was running\u2026 he thought somebody was chasing him and he hopped some fences, and he went in the house\u2026 I\u2019m wondering if mentally he was relieved if he saw police.\u201d The LA Times, citing three law enforcement sources, reported the suspect shouted the mayor\u2019s first name during the break in. Hunter told KNX News if he shouted anyone\u2019s name it may have been that of his brother Aaron, but not \u201cKaren.\u201d When reached by phone by CNN, the brother declined to discuss Hunter\u2019s case. The break-in happened on the morning of April 21, during the security officers\u2019 morning shift change when there was a \u201cshort gap\u201d of time when an officer was not on the property, Los Angeles Police Chief Dominic Choi said Tuesday. Police have remedied the scheduling gap with an overlap in shifts, he said. Hunter is accused of entering the home by smashing a rear glass door, causing somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000 worth of damage, the district attorney\u2019s office has said. His hand was cut during the ordeal, leaving \u201cblood stains throughout the house,\u201d the office said. No one in Bass\u2019s family was harmed, a spokesperson for the Democratic mayor said. The mayor\u2019s official residence, the Getty House, is a nondescript Tudor-style home that sits on a corner in the Windsor Square neighborhood and fits seamlessly into its lineup of historic mansions. If convicted of the charges, Hunter could receive a prison sentence of up to 13 years and four months. In 2016, Hunter was convicted of armed robbery in Massachusetts, according to the criminal complaint.

{"id": "politics_redistricting-states-congressional-maps-house", "text": "Multiple Supreme Court showdowns. Closed-door negotiations.\u00a0And millions of dollars in litigation. After months of legal and legislative skirmishes around the country, much of the redistricting drama of the 2024 election cycle is behind us. And it has ended pretty close to where it began: Just a handful of seats could determine which party controls the US House of Representatives, where Republicans now hold a threadbare majority. In North Carolina, newly empowered GOP state legislators took an aggressive approach with their map-drawing, crafting lines that are expected to allow their party to flip at least three seats now held by Democrats. But, in recently concluded redistricting in New York, Democrats, who had final say over the map, adopted a more modest position \u2013 essentially turning just one Republican-held seat a deeper shade of blue. In the South, Democrats are expected to gain two seats as a result of Voting Rights Act rulings out of Alabama and Louisiana. But a protracted battle over the congressional map in another Southern state, Georgia, has not changed the partisan balance of the state\u2019s US House delegation heading into November. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that with all of the states where we\u2019ve had things going on and with all the different lawsuits, we are really only talking about a small number of districts that are guaranteed to change hands as a result of this entire shuffle,\u201d said Nick Seabrook, a political scientist at the University of North Florida and the author of the 2022 book \u201cOne Person, One Vote: A Surprising History of Gerrymandering in America.\u201d \u201cWe have actually emerged nationally with a pretty fair map,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly think that there are ample opportunities for either party to win.\u201d Adam Kincaid, the president and executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, sees a \u201ctick to the right\u201d under the new landscape, with the likely net addition of two more House seats that former President Donald Trump would have carried in 2020. But he cautioned that it was still a \u201ctight map\u201d and a \u201ctight electorate.\u201d \u201cFrom top to bottom, the country is a 50-50 country right now,\u201d Kincaid said. (Although Republicans control the House by a narrow margin, under the map used in the 2022 midterm elections, 17 of those GOP lawmakers were elected in communities that backed President Joe Biden in 2020.) Democrats, meanwhile, say they emerged in a stronger position after wielding the nearly 60-year-old Voting Rights Act to prevail in legal fights in deep-red Alabama and Louisiana. Federal judges ordered lawmakers in those states to give Black residents more opportunities to elect House candidates of their choice. \u201cAlabama and Louisiana are just two states once thought to be unreachable in the fight for fairness that have quickly become more representative\u201d as a result of the legal actions, John Bisognano, president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m confident the House map will remain highly competitive going into 2024.\u201d Here\u2019s a state-by-state look at the recent redistricting disputes and where they stand: Louisiana Facing a court-ordered deadline, the Republican-controlled state Legislature in January approved a map with a second Black-majority district that\u00a0is expected to be\u00a0in effect for this year\u2019s elections. The action, viewed as a win for Democrats, endangers the seat now held by Republican Rep. Garret Graves. The implementation of the new map follows a protracted legal battle over the state\u2019s  congressional district lines. Although Black people make up roughly a third of the state\u2019s population, Louisiana has just one Black lawmaker \u2013 who is also the lone Democrat \u2013 in its six-member US House delegation. A federal judge threw out the state\u2019s Republican-drawn map in 2022, saying it likely violated the Voting Rights Act. Republican officials in the state appealed to the US Supreme Court, which put the lower-court ruling on hold until it decided the Alabama case, which it did in June this year. Once the high court had weighed in on the Alabama case, the legal skirmishes again lurched to life in Louisiana. A federal court had given the GOP-controlled state Legislature until the end of January to draw a new map, after deciding that the lower court had ruled correctly that the state lawmakers\u2019 map improperly diluted the voting power of Louisiana\u2019s Black residents. If the Legislature had not acted by that deadline, the lower court could have proceeded to a full trial to resolve the map in time for this year\u2019s elections. A dozen non-Black voters filed a legal challenge to the Legislature\u2019s map, arguing it was an illegal racial gerrymander,\u00a0and a\u00a0three-judge panel agreed. That set off a fresh appeal to the US Supreme Court, which on May 15 paused the panel\u2019s ruling in an order that\u00a0will likely allow the Legislature\u2019s map\u00a0to be used in this year\u2019s elections. New York Republicans flipped four US House seats in New York in the 2022 midterm elections, victories that helped secure their party\u2019s majority in the chamber. Then, a\u00a0ruling by the state\u2019s highest court\u00a0appeared to jeopardize those gains by potentially making it easier for Democrats to pick up as many as six GOP-held seats. In the end, however, the Democratic state lawmakers, who hold ultimate control of the redistricting process, settled on a map that made only modest adjustments to the status quo lines. First, a bit of history: A state court judge oversaw the process of\u00a0drawing the map used in the 2022 elections\u00a0following a long legal battle and the inability of New York\u2019s bipartisan Independent Redistricting Commission to agree on new lines. But Democrats\u00a0scored a court victory last summer\u00a0when a state appellate court ruled that the redistricting commission should redraw the map. Republicans appealed that decision, and oral arguments were held in November before New York\u2019s Court of Appeals, the state\u2019s highest court. On December 12, the Court of Appeals ordered the state to once again restart the mapmaking process. As a result, New York\u2019s redistricting commission created a new map, but the Democratic-controlled state Legislature tinkered with the commission\u2019s lines, as permitted under state law. The\u00a0Legislature\u2019s final product\u00a0ended up putting a Central New York seat held by Republican freshman Brandon Williams at greater risk for his party. It also shored up for Democrats Tom Suozzi\u2019s Long Island seat, which the party\u00a0flipped\u00a0in a February special election to succeed expelled former Rep.\u00a0George Santos. Leaders of both political parties say they can live with the map\u2019s modest approach, which still puts the Empire State at the epicenter of the battle for the House. But some progressives have criticized New York Democrats, who hold supermajorities in the state Legislature, for not taking a more aggressive approach. Former New York Rep. John Faso, a Republican who had been a key player in litigation over redistricting, said the map drawn by Democrats \u201chas no material differences from the current map.\u201d \u201cThis turned out to be much ado about very little,\u201d he added. North Carolina North Carolina\u2019s legislature, where Republicans hold a supermajority, has drawn new congressional lines that observers say could prove a windfall for the GOP and boost the party\u2019s chances of retaining its House majority next year. The state\u2019s current House delegation is split 7-7 between Democrats and Republicans. A map that Republican state lawmakers approved put three House Democrats in what one expert called \u201calmost impossible to win\u201d districts. The affected Democrats were Reps. Jeff Jackson, who currently represents a Charlotte-area district; Wiley Nickel, who holds a Raleigh-area seat; and Kathy Manning, who represents Greensboro and other parts of north-central North Carolina. All three opted not to seek reelection to the House. A fourth Democrat, Rep. Don Davis, saw his district retooled to become more friendly toward Republicans while remaining competitive for both parties. State-level gains in the 2022 midterm elections gave the GOP new sway over redistricting in this swing state \u2013 Republicans flipped the state Supreme Court, whose members are chosen in partisan elections. Last year, the new GOP majority on the court tossed out a 2022 ruling by the then-Democratic leaning court against partisan gerrymandering. A map that had been created after the Democratic-led high court\u2019s ruling resulted in the current even split in the state\u2019s House delegation. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper does not have veto power over redistricting legislation. A group of Black and Latino residents of North Carolina filed a lawsuit alleging that the GOP-approved map \u201cintentionally discriminates\u201d against minority voters in violation of the US Constitution. Alabama In one of the cycle\u2019s highest-profile redistricting cases, a three-judge panel in Alabama approved a map that created a second congressional district with a substantial Black population. Before the court action, Alabama \u2013 which is 27% Black \u2013 had only one Black-majority district out of seven seats. The fight over the map went all the way to the US Supreme Court \u2013 which issued a surprise ruling, affirming a lower-court opinion that ordered Alabama to include a second Black-majority district or \u201csomething quite close to it.\u201d Under the map used for the 2024 election, the state\u2019s 2nd District now loops into Mobile to create a seat where nearly half the population is Black. The high court\u2019s 5-4 decision in June saw two conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, side with the three liberals to uphold the lower-court ruling. Their action kept intact a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act: that it\u2019s illegal to draw maps that effectively keep Black voters from electing a candidate of their choice. The ruling reverberated around the country and affected the outcome of similar court cases underway in Louisiana and Georgia that centered on whether Republican-drawn maps improperly diluted Black political power in those states. Given that Black voters in Alabama have traditionally backed Democrats, the party now stands a better chance of winning the newly reconfigured district and sending two of its members to Congress after November\u2019s elections. The new map also could result in two Black US House members from Alabama serving together for the first time in state history. Georgia Georgia Republicans, who hold a governing trifecta in the state,\u00a0finalized a new congressional map\u00a0last year that safeguarded their party\u2019s dominance in state politics and dashed Democrats\u2019 hopes of adding an additional US House seat. The new map complied with an order issued by US District Judge Steve Jones to establish an additional Black-majority district.\u00a0But it preserved the GOP\u2019s 9-5 edge in Georgia\u2019s US House delegation by moving the Atlanta-area district represented by\ufeff\u00a0Rep. Lucy McBath, a Black Democrat, farther into Republican territory. Jones had ordered state lawmakers\u00a0to draw a new congressional map\u00a0by December 8, arguing that the Republican-controlled legislature improperly diluted the political power of Black voters in their establishment of district boundaries following the 2020 census.\u00a0In that ruling, Jones said state lawmakers\u2019 earlier map had violated the Voting Rights Act. In a big win for Republicans, Jones in late December ruled that the new legislature-drawn map that preserved Republicans\u2019 9-5 advantage \u201cfully complied\u201d with his order. A separate federal case in Georgia challenges the congressional map on constitutional grounds. Florida A state judge in September struck down congressional lines for northern Florida that had been championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, ruling that the Republican governor\u2019s map had improperly diluted Black voting power. This case, unlike the Alabama fight decided by the US Supreme Court, centers on provisions in the state constitution. The judge concluded that the congressional boundaries \u2013 which essentially dismantled a seat once held by Al Lawson, a Black Democrat, that connected Black communities across a northern reach of the Florida \u2013 violated the state\u2019s Fair Districts amendments, enacted by voters. One amendment specifically bars the state from drawing a district that diminishes the ability of racial minorities \u201cto elect representatives of their choice.\u201d But in December, a state appeals court upheld the map DeSantis had advocated, saying the plaintiffs \u201cfailed to present any evidence\u201d that the earlier version of the district \u2013 which connected Black communities from Jacksonville to Tallahassee \u2013 contained a singular cohesive community that would have a right to protection under Florida\u2019s constitution. The case is now before the all-Republican state Supreme Court, where DeSantis appointees hold most seats. The disputed map appears likely to remain in place for this year\u2019s elections after the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request to speed up the case and hold arguments before the congressional candidate qualifying period in April. In a separate case \u2014 centered on whether the map violates the US Constitution \u2013 a federal court sided with DeSantis. Observers say that in the end, the outcome of the state litigation is more likely than the federal case to determine the future of the North Florida district, given the state constitution\u2019s especially strong protections for the voting rights of racial minorities and the lower burden of proof required to establish that those rights were abridged. Kentucky The Kentucky Supreme Court  in December rejected arguments from Democrats that a map drawn by the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature violated the state constitution as an \u201cextreme partisan\u201d gerrymander. The dispute centered on lawmakers\u2019 decision to move Kentucky\u2019s capital city \u2013 Democratic-leaning Frankfort \u2013 out of the 6th Congressional District and into an oddly shaped \u2013 and solidly Republican \u2013 1st District. Doing so helped shore up the GOP odds of holding the 6th District, represented by Republican Andy Barr. Under its previous lines, the 6th District was a more competitive seat. (Democrat Amy McGrath came within 3 points of beating Barr in 2018; last year, Barr won a sixth term under the new lines by 29 points.) A lower-court judge had ruled that the Republican-drawn map did not violate the state\u2019s constitution, and the state\u2019s high court, in a December 14 ruling, agreed. South Carolina A redistricting case pending before the US Supreme Court centers on the future of a Charleston-area seat held by Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, who made headlines last year for joining House GOP hard-liners in voting to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker. Last year, a three-judge panel concluded that the lines for the coastal 1st Congressional District, as drawn by state GOP lawmakers, amounted to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The Republican lawmakers appealed to the US Supreme Court. During oral arguments, several justices in the court\u2019s conservative majority expressed skepticism that South Carolina officials had engaged in an improper racial gerrymander and seemed inclined to reinstate the lawmakers\u2019 map. The 2024 elections will proceed under the current map, the three-judge panel ruled in March. The judges, in part, cited the delay in the high court issuing a decision. New Mexico Republicans in New Mexico argued that the congressional lines drawn by the Democrats who control state government amounted to an illegal gerrymander under the state\u2019s constitution. At stake: a swing district along the US border with Mexico. If Republicans had prevailed, the 2nd District seat \u2013 now held by a Democratic Rep. Gabe Vasquez \u2013 could have become more favorable to Republicans. But a state judge in October upheld the map drawn by Democrats, and the New Mexico Supreme Court affirmed that ruling. Utah The state Supreme Court, in a case it heard in July, is considering whether it even has the authority to weigh in on map-drawing decisions by the GOP-controlled state Legislature. Republican state officials have argued that the court\u2019s power over redistricting decisions is limited. Advocacy groups and a handful of voters are challenging a congressional map that further carved up Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County between four decidedly Republican districts. Doing so, the plaintiffs asserted in their lawsuit, \u201ctakes a slice of Salt Lake County and grafts it onto large swaths of the rest of Utah,\u201d allowing Republican voters in rural areas and smaller cities far away from Salt Lake to \u201cdictate the outcome of elections.\u201d This story and headline have been updated.

{"id": "2024_05_16_us_angelo-quinto-death-police-antioch-settlement", "text": "A Northern California city has agreed to pay $7.5 million to the family of a 30-year-old man who died days after police restrained him in 2020, the parties announced Wednesday, settling a wrongful death claim that the family filed. Angelo Quinto\u2019s family filed the claim against the city of Antioch in February 2021, alleging he was undergoing a mental health episode and died days after police officers kneeled on the back of his neck for nearly five minutes to subdue him. A year later, the\u00a0Contra Costa County District Attorney\u2019s office said\u00a0an internal examination determined Quinto\u2019s neck area had no damage; that it saw \u201cno evidence of criminal offense by Antioch police officers\u201d in Quinto\u2019s death; and that the officers had \u201cengaged with Quinto in a manner that was lawful and objectively reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d \u201cWhile there are conflicting medical opinions as to the cause of death, the accounts of what transpired in the bedroom are consistent among all witnesses in that no police officer applied pressure to Quinto\u2019s neck,\u201d the district attorney\u2019s office said in 2022. Police restrained Quinto at the family\u2019s home in Antioch on December 23, 2020, after his sister called police because he had a mental health episode and she feared he would hurt their mother, the family\u2019s attorneys had said. Quinto lost consciousness, and was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead three days later, the family attorneys said in the claim. Quinto\u2019s cause of death \u201cwas Excited Delirium Syndrome due to drug intoxication, psychiatric conditions, physical exertion, and cardiac arrest,\u201d\u00a0an autopsy\u00a0performed five days after Quinto was restrained by the officers found, the district attorney\u2019s office said in 2022. On Wednesday,\u00a0an attorney for Quinto\u2019s family, Ben Nisenbaum, said that Quinto\u2019s family was the \u201cmoving force\u201d behind\u00a0legislation\u00a0eventually signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom banning excited delirium and other similar terms to be listed as cause of death in California. He said a coroner inquest listed excited delirium \u2013 which is \u201ccharacterized by agitation, aggression, acute distress and sudden death,\u201d\u00a0according to\u00a0the National Library of Medicine \u2013 as Quinto\u2019s cause of death. John L. Burris,\u00a0another lawyer for the family, said the settlement shows something positive can come out of a tragedy. \u201cThis is a case where the family, from day one, took the tragedy and the loss and the circumstances surrounding Angelo\u2019s death and tried to turn it into a positive good, and they did so,\u201d Burris said. \u201cThe real plus that comes from this case is the collective efforts on their part, and the willingness on the part of the city officials, including the mayor\u2019s office \u2026 to bring about a positive change,\u201d Burris said. Antioch Mayor Lamar Hernandez-Thorpe said that while two people died in police custody during the first 30 days of his administration, he \u201cwas left with the impression that this wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d \u201c$7.5 million later \u2013 and that\u2019s never enough to make up for somebody\u2019s loved\u00a0one \u2013 we recognized that it was a bigger issue than what we understood,\u201d the mayor said at Wednesday\u2019s news conference, adding that the city council had previously fought against body-worn cameras for police officers. \u201cYears of, frankly, failed leadership brought us to this moment, but I am happy to say that we\u2019ve done an enormous job in terms of changing the culture, not just at the police department, but at the city as well, and taking these concerns serious,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot in terms of establishing reforms that I think build a safer community for every single segment of our city and to ensure that people do have justice when we are wrong.\u201d During the news conference, Quinto\u2019s stepfather, Robert Collins, thanked the mayor and the city council for listening to his family\u2019s calls for change. \u201cWe found a city that has listened to a lot of our pleas and has begun to make the necessary changes that we need to have,\u201d Collins said. \u201cIt\u2019s a process of change. We\u2019re not done here. It\u2019s a process that will take many years.\u201d Thanks to the family\u2019s claim, police body cameras \u201care now a reality in Antioch,\u201d and a non-police mental health response team \u201chas prevented other people from dying,\u201d Collins said. Quinto\u2019s sister,\u00a0Isabella Collins,\u00a0described her brother as \u201cmultifaceted.\u201d He was artistic, loved to cook and was always trying to better himself, she said. \u201cThis is some semblance of justice that we\u2019ve been able to work toward positive reforms and positive change \u2013 legislative and advocacy change,\u201d\u00a0Isabella Collins said. \u201cI think that if my brother couldn\u2019t have life, that perhaps this is what he would choose, this impact on other people\u2019s lives and other people\u2019s legacies, the ability to pave the way toward some justice and justice for others.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/angelo-quinto-death-police-antioch-settlement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "us"}}

The revelation\u00a0is\u00a0almost certain to prompt calls for Alito, a member of the court\u2019s conservative wing, to recuse himself from several high-profile cases pending before the court this year involving the election and subsequent attack on the US Capitol, including the blockbuster question of whether Trump may claim immunity from federal election subversion charges. The Times published a photo of the inverted flag, which it said was seen at the justice\u2019s home in Alexandria,\u00a0Virginia, on\u00a0January\u00a017, 2021. A spokeswoman for the Supreme Court did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN, which has not independently verified the flag\u2019s use. \u201cI had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,\u201d Alito said in an emailed statement to\u00a0the\u00a0Times. \u201cIt was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor\u2019s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\u201d The upside-down flag became a symbol of the\u00a0\u201cStop the Steal\u201d\u00a0movement in the weeks and months following the election,\u00a0in which Trump\u2019s supporters falsely claimed that Biden\u2019s win was illegitimate due to\u00a0widespread fraud. The inverted flag was widely seen during the January 6, 2021,\u00a0attack on the US Capitol. The Times said it\u00a0was not clear how long the flag flew outside of Alito\u2019s home. The story will heap\u00a0further\u00a0scrutiny on the high court at a time when it is already facing considerable blowback. Justice Clarence Thomas has been the subject of significant criticism and calls for recusal in election-related cases after his wife,\u00a0conservative activist\u00a0Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas,\u00a0acknowledged she attended\u00a0Trump\u2019s rally\u00a0before the Capitol attack and supported White House efforts to discredit the election results. Thomas recently accused his critics of \u201cnastiness\u201d and \u201clies\u201d in remarks to a judicial conference in Alabama. Last fall, in response to a series of revelations about travel accepted by Thomas and Alito, the Supreme Court adopted a code of conduct for the first time.

We can point fingers at who\u2019s at fault, who has failed to make the ultimate contact, but in all reality, we all could have done better \u2014 from the sheriff\u2019s office to the Army to the family,\u201d said James Herling, Card\u2019s brother-in-law. Documents shared with CNN by the Sagadahoc County Sheriff\u2019s Office showed Card\u2019s family had called the department as far back as May 2023, voicing concerns over his well-being and access to firearms. The US Army previously told CNN a health and wellness check was requested by the shooter\u2019s unit \u201cout of an abundance of caution after the unit became concerned for his safety.\u201d An independent review last year concluded the sheriff\u2019s office acted \u201creasonably\u201d but recommended improvements to the department\u2019s strategy. Card, a US Army reservist and certified firearms instructor, went on two shooting rampages at a bar and bowling alley in Lewiston, killing 18 people and wounding 13 others with an assault rifle. After a 48-hour manhunt following the shootings, Card was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head near a river some 10 miles from Lewiston. The Concussion Legacy Foundation said in March that tissue samples from Card\u2019s brain showed evidence of traumatic brain injury and suggested he had been exposed to \u201cthousands of low-level blasts\u201d during his time at an Army hand grenade training range. \u201cI am hoping that this commission will find that the DOD needs to enhance the protection of our soldiers because when they release them as civilians, they are releasing them without proper care,\u201d Herling said. \u201cThis is not an excuse for the behavior and action that Robbie committed. It was a wrongful act of evil. My brother-in-law was not this man. His brain was hijacked.\u201d Nicole Herling, Card\u2019s sister, testified about the \u201csignificant challenge\u201d to contact Card\u2019s chain of command in the Army for help when he began showing signs of mental illness. \u201cThe Department of Defense\u2019s negligence regarding traumatic brain injury must be addressed, and they must be held accountable for change,\u201d Nicole Herling said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to acknowledge that Robbie\u2019s decline involved other factors, and I\u2019m not here to excuse his behavior,\u201d she added. \u201cIf we appeared silent, it wasn\u2019t because we lacked empathy.

{"id": "2024_05_16_politics_bob-menendez-trial-takeaways", "text": "The corruption trial of Sen. Bob Menendez is off to an explosive start, with prosecutors saying the New Jersey Democrat was \u201con the take\u201d from a cast of shady characters and lawyers for Menendez and his co-defendants all casting blame on the senator\u2019s wife, Nadine, for any potential crimes. Menendez, 70, has been charged\u00a0with acting as a foreign agent on behalf of Egypt and assisting the government of Qatar, all while taking bribes from several New Jersey businessmen.\u00a0He is being tried with Wael Hana, an Egyptian American businessman, and Fred Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer. All three have pleaded not guilty. The allegations against Menendez, who stepped down as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\u00a0after being indicted, have already put his long political career on the brink. He is not running for reelection in next month\u2019s Democratic primary but has said he would consider an independent bid should he be exonerated. After seating a jury Wednesday, the lawyers took centerstage. First up was the prosecution, which sought to take the complex allegations and spell them out in plain English \u2013 describing a series of \u201cschemes\u201d conducted by the defendants and led by a powerful US senator who was, as assistant US Attorney Lara Pomerantz put it, \u201con the take\u201d and using his wife as a \u201cgo-between\u201d with his partners. (Nadine Menendez is also charged and set to go on trial in July, separately from her husband.) The senator\u2019s lawyer, Avi Weitzman, painted a much different picture, depicting his client as a lovestruck naif, unaware of Nadine Menendez\u2019s financial dealings, debts and \u2013 most spectacularly \u2013 the contents of her closet in their home, where she kept gold bars allegedly given to her as bribes. Attorneys for Hana and Daibes followed a similar script. Like Weitzman, they also argued that the transactions between the three, and Menendez\u2019s wife, did not qualify as a crime \u2013 but were simply friendly gift-giving outside the context of the senator\u2019s official governmental powers. Here are five takeaways from the opening of the Bob Menendez trial: The Blame (Nadine) Game The most striking notes from the opening statements by the defendants\u2019 lawyers concerned Nadine Menendez and her role in the alleged crimes of her husband, Hana and Daibes. While Pomerantz, the prosecutor, described Nadine Menendez mostly as a conduit for the passage of bribes between the men, the senator\u2019s lawyer suggested she was a driving, deceitful figure. He told the story of a younger woman, who was \u201cbeautiful,\u201d \u201ctall\u201d and cosmopolitan. Nadine Menendez, Weitzman said, \u201chad financial concerns she kept\u201d from her husband and engaged in cash and gold exchanges of which he was not made aware. \u201cShe kept things from him,\u201d Weitzman told the jury. \u201cShe kept him in the dark.\u201d Weitzman brought a series of visual aids to underscore his point. One image from the couple\u2019s home showed Nadine Menendez\u2019s \u201clocked closet,\u201d a rambling walk-in with messy racks and clothes strewn on the floor, where the now infamous gold bars were found. The senator, Weitzman said, \u201cdid not know of the gold bars that existed in that closet.\u201d Later on, Weitzman showed another photo, this time of the senator\u2019s closet \u2013 a smaller space with neatly hung suit jackets and shirts. Nothing of interest, he stressed to the jury, had been found there. The lawyer for Hana, Lawrence Lustberg, also focused a large chunk of his opening statement on Nadine Menendez. She and his client \u201ccared about each other,\u201d Lustberg said, and frequently gave one another gifts \u2013 tequila, jewelry, watches. Their personal friendship, he explained, led to an ill-fated business arrangement. Nadine Menendez was supposed to help set up offices for Hana\u2019s halal company, but she \u2013 as Lustberg characterized it \u2013 not only failed to follow through but was essentially an absentee employee and did not want to work eight-hour days. The three checks from his company to her, each for $10,000, were not bribes, Lustberg insisted, but parting compensation to \u201cmake her good on it.\u201d Later Thursday morning, Bob Menendez announced in a statement that his wife has breast cancer and will undergo a mastectomy. Her trial had been delayed and split from her husband\u2019s owing to a previously disclosed \u201cserious medical\u00a0condition.\u201d The senator said the couple went public with the information in a bid for privacy, \u201cas a result of constant press inquiries and reporters following\u201d her. The defense drills down on the definition of \u2018crime\u2019 \u201cRobert Menendez was a United States senator on the take,\u201d Pomerantz, an assistant US attorney, told the jury in her opening remarks. \u201cMotivated by greed, focused on how much money he could put in his own pocket and his wife\u2019s pocket. That is why we are here today. That is what this trial is all about.\u201d Lawyers for the senator, Hana and Daibes, again, offered a different take. On Thursday, Cesar de Castro, Daibes\u2019 lawyer, argued that prosecutors were distorting the nature of his client\u2019s relationship with Bob and Nadine Menendez. \u201cThe government wants you to assume, presume and infer the worst. It needs you to assume the worst in order for the evidence to make sense, and that tells you everything you need to know about this case,\u201d de Castro said. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing on which we can agree with the government: This case is about relationships.\u201d Hana\u2019s lawyer made a similar point. None of Hana\u2019s \u201cgifts\u201d to Nadine Menendez, \u201cbefore or after she met Mr. Menendez, were in exchange for anything,\u201d Lustberg said. \u201cWhat the government is trying to do here is criminalize gift-giving.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he added, \u201chuman beings give each other gifts.\u201d Weitzman, the senator\u2019s lawyer, offered a broader criticism of the government\u2019s case, saying that prosecutors were conflating \u201cconstituent services\u201d with bribery and \u201cdiplomacy\u201d with allegations that he worked as a foreign agent. He argued that his client, in his advocacy for Hana on a range of issues, \u201cwas acting lawfully\u201d in his role as a US senator. \u201cYou might not like it,\u201d Weitzman told jurors, \u201cbut it is not a crime.\u201d A question of culture The gold bars discovered in the Menendez home, which the indictment says were given as bribes, has become the trial\u2019s trademark, headline-grabbing detail. In court, the defense attorneys in their opening statements sought to defuse the issue. Their message was consistent: The giving or receiving of gold or gold bars should not imply any criminal behavior. Especially so in this case, they argued, because both Nadine Menendez, originally from Lebanon, and Hana, an Egyptian immigrant, hail from a region where keeping gold is \u201ccultural,\u201d as Weitzman stated. Hana\u2019s lawyer said his client gave Nadine Menendez gifts aplenty, but he told the jury that they \u201cwill hear nothing about gold bars that are traceable to Wael Hana in the senator\u2019s home.\u201d They will be told, he said, that gold is a particular gift that people in the Middle East give each other. When Daibes\u2019 attorney had the stage, he accused prosecutors of unfairly concluding that the presence of gold suggests \u201csomething nefarious must be happening.\u201d The government\u2019s case, de Castro said, failed to acknowledge \u201cthat investing in precious metals\u201d is common, as is the giving of gold to friends. Boots, bags, boxes and jackets\u2026 of cash The\u00a0first witness called by prosecutors, FBI special agent Aristotelis Kougemitros, testified Thursday in new and remarkable detail about the nearly half a million dollars in cash,\u00a0alongside\u00a0gold jewelry and\u00a0more than a dozen\u00a0gold bars, that investigators seized from the Menendez home. Perhaps more interesting than the sum, though, was where it was all discovered: in a safe, in two black duffel bags, in several boxes and jackets, and stuffed in\u00a0two pairs of boots. All of it was captured in photographs shown to the court by prosecutors. All told, the FBI found $486,461 in cash, 11 one-ounce gold bars and a pair of one-kilogram gold bars. Inside Bob Menendez\u2019s home office, adorned with pictures of the senator, sports memorabilia and a small statue of the US Capitol atop his desk, a large black duffel bag found on a chair contained two smaller bags\u00a0\u2013 a\u00a0Burberry bag filled with $100,000 and another black bag with $33,220 inside, Kougemitros said. Moving on to the\u00a0garage, the FBI found $4,300 in the pockets of a blue congressional jacket with the emblem of the US Senate woven on the top left and the senator\u2019s name engraved on the other side.\u00a0Other apparel concealing the cash included a tweed jacket containing $21,000, a black leather jacket filled with $6,000, another black jacket with $28,000 inside and a coat containing $8,000. And then there were the boots. One pair of red boots turned up by the FBI contained dozens of $100 bills. Inside another pair of boots lay $7,500, Kougemitros said. Pomerantz finished questioning Kougemitros\u00a0before the court adjourned for the day.\u00a0He will return to the stand for cross-examination Friday morning. Who\u2019s paying attention? (Not Republicans) Though the courtroom has been mostly full during the opening days of the Menendez trial, there has been a notable lack of hoopla outside on the streets of Lower Manhattan \u2013 especially in comparison with the circus-like atmosphere that has consumed former President Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial, which is taking place a short walk away. That\u2019s welcome news, or a pleasing lack thereof, for national Democrats who might otherwise be facing tougher questions about Bob Menendez\u2019s alleged crimes and why, despite the damning nature of the indictment, he is still a member in good standing of the US Senate. (More than half of the Senate Democratic caucus has called on him to step down, including top ally Cory Booker, the junior senator from New Jersey. Menendez resigned as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but there has been no effort to remove him from office.) Menendez is up for reelection this year but will not run in the Democratic primary, which Rep. Andy Kim is poised to win in his bid to succeed the longtime incumbent. But with no serious Republican challenger in the race, and the national GOP pre-occupied with Trump \u2013 many of them making regular pilgrimages to New York to appear beside him \u2013 the Menendez case has mostly flown below the radar outside New York and New Jersey. In fact, the Democrat most likely to suffer politically could be the senator\u2019s son, Rob Menendez Jr., a first-term US House member from North Jersey. He is facing a primary challenge from Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla, who has frequently invoked the incumbent\u2019s father during their tense campaign. \u201cHis\u00a0son also happens to be my primary opponent in NJ-08 and was handpicked by his father for his seat,\u201d Bhalla said in his call for the senator to resign earlier his year. \u201cThis culture of corruption and cronyism is bad for New Jersey and bad for America.\u201d This story and headline have been updated.

Eight people are dead while 45 injured were taken to medical facilities, including eight in critical condition, James Lucas with Marion County Fire Rescue said earlier in the day. \u201cThere\u2019s a high probability this may be beyond eight fatalities,\u201d Riordan said, noting some of the injured, including the driver of the pickup truck, are in \u201cvery serious condition.\u201d \u201cIdentities of the deceased will be released pending next of kin notification,\u201d Kerner said in his statement. \u201cOur sympathies and prayers are with the families of the deceased. Consistent with our duties, the Florida Highway Patrol will conduct both a thorough and exhaustive traffic crash and criminal investigation.\u201d Footage captured by CNN affiliate WESH showed the bus \u2013 which Riordan said was taking the workers to a farm in the area \u2013 lying on its side in a field, with first responders\u2019 vehicles parked nearby, their lights flashing. Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods indicated authorities believe the bus passengers were migrant workers, telling reporters, \u201cWe\u2019re a very big agricultural county. So this time of year, we always have migrant workers that are in our county, that are on buses just like this.\u201d In a news conference Tuesday evening, Juan Sabines, the Mexican consul in Orlando, said the victims were all from Mexico and were in the United States on temporary agricultural worker visas. \u201cPlease pray for these nationals,\u201d Sabines said. \u201cWe hear a lot of bad things of the immigrants all the time, in the reality, these people (are) good people. (They are) very good people, young people.\u201d \u201cThey stay in this country just for work, with (a) visa,\u201d he added. \u201cThese (are) very good people and now they lost the main support of their family.\u201d \u201cWith regret, I confirm the death of 8 agricultural workers,\u201d said Mexico\u2019s Foreign Affairs Secretary Alicia B\u00e1rcena Tuesday in a\u00a0post in Spanish on X. B\u00e1rcena said her country\u2019s consul \u201cwill provide all the support to our compatriots and their families.\u201d Woods noted there were challenges with language barriers, but said bilingual sheriff\u2019s office personnel and support staff were assisting in the investigation. The National Transportation Safety Board is monitoring the situation, it said, and the US Department of Transportation\u2019s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration similarly said it was aware of the crash. \u201cOur sincere thoughts are with the victims, their families, and the community as FMCSA assesses currently available information in support of state and local safety officials,\u201d an agency spokesperson said. Westbound lanes on Highway 40 will be closed \u201cfor most of the day,\u201d the Marion County Sheriff\u2019s Office said on its Facebook page, asking motorists to take alternate routes. This is a developing story and will be updated.

{"id": "2024_05_16_us_brown-pelicans-california-coast", "text": "Droves of starving brown pelicans have been found stranded on the California coast since late April and the root cause of the event remains a mystery, wildlife watchers say. Arriving dehydrated, starved and injured from fishing lines and hooks, the pelicans are mostly turning up in the Monterey and Santa Cruz areas in Northern California, International Bird Rescue, a nonprofit conservation organization, said on its website. They\u2019re also popping up in \u201codd spots\u201d in Southern California, including a lake at Inglewood\u2019s SoFi Stadium and a fire station in Malibu, the group said The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is \u201cperforming postmortem examinations on brown pelicans sent to our laboratories in Sacramento and Santa Cruz.\u00a0Preliminary findings indicate emaciation as the primary issue contributing to this stranding event,\u201d department spokesperson Tim Daly told CNN in a statement. International Bird Rescue reported more than 260 brown pelicans \u2013 a once endangered species \u2013 have arrived at the organization\u2019s California treatment centers since April 20. \u201cDiagnostic testing has not revealed any evidence of diseases such as bird flu that may be causing these strandings. Bird Rescue\u2019s staff and volunteers are working tirelessly to provide the affected birds with the best care they desperately need to recover and return to the wild,\u201d the group said on its website. The nonprofit has organized Amazon wish lists for surgical tape, syringes, pet hair blow-dryers, waterfowl food, rubber floor mats, gloves and more. The seabirds have displayed this behavior before \u2013 almost exactly two years ago \u2013 in the same areas. And the recovery effort is expensive. In May 2022, the crisis cost the rescue group $45 per day for food, medicine and staff and $2,000 in fish, it said. Before 2022, the last great influx of brown pelicans to International Bird Rescue was in 2012. Two years ago, testing also showed symptoms of starvation in the nearly 800 pelicans that arrived in rehabilitation centers. \u201cIn Spring 2022, the precise factors that contributed to reduced prey intake by the pelicans was not determined although scientists concluded the pelicans likely had difficulty reaching prey fish in the ocean as they normally would,\u201d Daly\u2019s statement said. \u201cIn 2022 and in this current event, strong storm systems occurred in the southern California region in the spring preceding the events, and it\u2019s possible these conditions impacted the pelican\u2019s ability to access prey fish under the water\u2019s surface.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/us/brown-pelicans-california-coast/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_us_ucla-student-protests-counterprotesters-invs", "text": "A young man in a white plastic mask beats a pro-Palestinian protester. Another in a maroon hoodie strikes a protester with a pole. A local instigator pushes down barricades. Law enforcement stood by for hours as counterprotesters attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment at UCLA on April 30,\u00a0which erupted into\u00a0the worst violence stemming from the ongoing college protests around the country over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. While a criminal investigation is underway into the assaults that occurred at UCLA, the identities of the most aggressive counterprotesters have gone largely unknown. A CNN review of footage, social media posts, and interviews found that some of the most dramatic attacks caught on camera that night were committed by people outside UCLA \u2013 not the university students and faculty who were eventually arrested. Many at the scene appeared dedicated to the pro-Israel cause, according to social media and their own words that night. The violent counterprotesters identified by CNN, which included an aspiring screenwriter and film producer and a local high school student \u2013 were joined by unlikely allies, several of whom are known throughout southern California for frequenting and disrupting a variety of protests and public gatherings. The young man sporting the white mask and a white hoodie in widely shared video clips is Edan On, a local 18-year-old high school senior, his mother confirmed to CNN, though she later said he denies being at UCLA. Video shows On joining the counterprotesters while waving a long white pole. At one point, he strikes a pro-Palestinian protester with the pole, and appears to continue to strike him even when he was down, as fellow counterprotesters piled on. \u201cEdan went to bully the Palestinian students in the tents at UCLA and played the song that they played to the Nukhba terrorists in prison!\u201d his mother boasted in Hebrew on Facebook, referencing Hamas. She circled an image of him that had been broadcast on the local news. \u201cHe is all over the news channels,\u201d his mother wrote in a now-deleted post. Some counterprotesters had been spotted on campus days earlier, drawn by a high-profile pro-Israel rally as inflammatory videos and claims rapidly spread across social media. Many at the scene\u00a0Tuesday hid their faces behind masks and scarves. Some attackers sprayed protesters with chemical irritants, hit them with wooden boards, punched and kicked them and shot fireworks into the crowd of students and supporters huddled behind umbrellas and wooden planks, attempting to stay safe. For hours, they sought to pull away pieces of the barrier, scooping up fallen wooden planks and poles to use as makeshift weapons, lunging toward pro-Palestinian protesters who emerged from the camp to protect it from being breached. As protesters chanted, \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving\u201d from the encampment, some counterprotesters shouted back, \u201cYou are terrorists, you are terrorists!\u201d Video footage shows that some counterprotesters instigated the fighting, while others did little to intervene. Then\u00a0police did\u00a0little as a large group of counterprotesters calmy walked away, leaving behind bloody, bruised students and other protesters. The Los Angeles Police Department and California Highway Patrol referred all questions about the incident to the UCLA Police Department, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Law enforcement did not track injuries from the attack. But according to the encampment\u2019s organizers, more than 150 students \u201cwere assaulted with pepper spray and bear mace,\u201d and at least 25 protesters ended up being transported to local emergency rooms to receive treatment for injuries including fractures, severe lacerations and chemical-induced injuries. \u201cI actually thought someone would get killed,\u201d said Rabbi Chaim Seidler-Feller, UCLA Hillel\u2019s Director Emeritus, who called 911 around midnight as he watched the violence on live TV. \u201cThey came to beat people up.\u201d The next day, Hillel at UCLA posted an open letter from student leaders denouncing what it called \u201cfringe members of the off-campus Jewish community\u201d who did not represent \u201cthe estimated 3,000 Jewish Bruins at UCLA.\u201d \u201cWe cannot have a clearer ask for the off-campus Jewish community: stay off our campus,\u201d it stated. \u201cYour actions are harming Jewish students.\u201d \u2018You guys are about to get f\u2014ed up\u2019 In one of the more dramatic videos of the night, a protester wearing the colors of the Palestinian flag underneath an LA Kings jersey was knocked to the ground and beaten by multiple counterprotesters as he guarded the encampment. One of those assailants was On, who rushed into the middle of the fray with his pole. When CNN showed On\u2019s mother a\u00a0video\u00a0of him attacking the protester,\u00a0she said Edan, who she confirmed is a senior at Beverly Hills High School, was only defending himself. His mother \u2013 who previously described a smaller group of UCLA students protesting the war last year as \u201chuman animals\u201d on social media \u2013 said dozens of his schoolmates had also gone to campus on the 30th and that her son intends to join the Israel Defense Forces. The school district said federal law prohibits sharing information about students, including confirming their identities. On could not be reached for comment directly. When CNN contacted On\u2019s mother for an interview with him, she replied that her son was in Israel and that he claimed he wasn\u2019t at UCLA despite her earlier confirmation. The man in the LA Kings jersey was ultimately dragged into a group of counterprotesters and kicked by an aspiring Los Angeles screenwriter\u00a0and\u00a0producer\u00a0who CNN identified as Malachi Marlan-Librett, according to a review of social media photos, footage from the protest and interviews with multiple people who knew him.\u00a0According to his LinkedIn, he graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2019 and attended a UCLA professional film and television program the following year. A man in a maroon hoodie joined Marlan-Librett in dragging the protester into the mob. The protester was later seen in a video receiving treatment for a bloody head injury at the encampment. Marlan-Librett and the man in the maroon hoodie, along with other counterprotesters, such as an unmasked man wearing a red bandana around his neck, were seen committing multiple acts of violence throughout the night. They became prime targets for online researchers who told CNN they had created internal nicknames such as #UCLARedBandana, #UCLANeffHat and #UCLAMaroonHoodie as they attempted to identify them. In one violent episode captured on video, Marlan-Librett is seen carrying the end of a broom in his hand, using it to strike a protester in the head before kicking him. Even after the protester retreats, Marlan-Librett sneaks up on him from behind and strikes him in the head once again. Marlan-Librett didn\u2019t respond to calls and texts from CNN. In another video, the man in the maroon hoodie runs toward the encampment yelling, \u201cYou guys are about to get f**ked up.\u201d In the over 3-hour-long livestream, the young man is in the thick of the scrum and can be seen hitting another man with a pole before arming counterprotesters with wood planks. The man could\u00a0be heard yelling at protesters, \u201cF**k\u00a0you, f**king terrorists,\u201d\u00a0then, \u201cThe score is 30,000\u201d \u2013 a reference to the number of\u00a0Palestinians\u00a0killed\u00a0by Israel\u2019s bombing campaign and ground offensive\u00a0in Gaza. Just minutes earlier, the man pepper-sprayed a journalist in the face, while she was filming the crowd. \u201cI had to walk off because I literally could not see anything,\u201d the local journalist, Dolores Quintana, told CNN. \u201cAnd it was getting in my mouth. And so, I was starting to choke.\u201d She said a volunteer came out of the encampment to wash out her eyes with water and saline. Quintana took a selfie when she could open her eyes again. In the photo, her face was drenched and pale, with red blotches on her forehead. \u201cThis was the worst situation I ever found myself in as a journalist,\u201d she said. \u201cI was afraid they were going to kill somebody.\u201d Local provocateurs in the fray According to multiple acquaintances of the man in the maroon hoodie, he attended Los Angeles Valley College with his brother. Both brothers were enrolled at USC in the fall 2023 semester for a couple weeks before disenrolling, according to the school. CNN could not reach the man in the maroon hoodie, and he did not have any apparent connection to UCLA. Neither did Tom Bibiyan, a 42-year-old who was once a local Green Party official. Bibiyan was stabbed at a KKK rally where he was a counter-protester in 2016 and has since become an ardent Trump supporter. His colorful Instagram page is a mix of right-wing memes, numerous posts defending famous men against sexual assault allegations and pro-Israel content. Video footage shows Bibiyan among those at the front line of people rushing the encampment in an attempt to remove protective metal barriers, as campus security guards watched the violence unfold. \u201cThe moment we rushed the terrorist encampment last night at ucla to take it apart,\u201d he captioned a video he posted to Instagram. \u201cF**k them kids,\u201d he said in a separate post, which has since been deleted. A CNN journalist reached Bibiyan outside his home, wearing the same jacket he had worn at UCLA, but he refused to say why he had taken part in the violence. \u201cYou\u2019re being a little rude, and I\u2019m going to call the police if you don\u2019t leave,\u201d he said. Other older men spotted among the mob looked familiar to local public school mom Angie Givant as she followed what happened that Tuesday night on social media: a group of right-wing provocateurs who she\u2019d seen protesting LGBTQ rights in public schools at school board and city council meetings around Los Angeles. \u201cAs soon as there were rumors that, you know, things were going to go down at UCLA, there was a mobilization of very familiar reactionary extremists,\u201d she told CNN. One of the older men, Narek Palyan, joined the group of counterprotesters despite having posted anti-Jewish tropes on his social media accounts. Palyan, who didn\u2019t appear to engage in the violence, claimed to CNN he has a child at UCLA, though a student was not seen accompanying him that night. \u201cI was definitely keeping the peace, at least trying to,\u201d he said. Student journalists attacked UCLA junior and student journalist Catherine Hamilton said that when a firework landed a few feet away from where she was standing and she saw the men approaching in masks, it was clear to her that they were about to do something they didn\u2019t want to be recognized for. \u201cIn that moment when that firework went off and started ringing in my ears, I was like, something very bad is going to happen on this campus,\u201d she said. When the police finally arrived hours later to break up the chaos, Hamilton and her colleagues regrouped to head back to their newsroom. As they walked past a line of cops and along a well-lit street in the center of campus, just before 3:30 am, she says they were encircled by a small group of\u00a0counterprotesters\u00a0mainly dressed in black. She told CNN the man leading the group was someone whom she immediately recognized. He was a counterprotester who had previously verbally harassed her and taken a photo of her press badge,\u00a0she said. Within seconds, they sprayed the student journalists with a type of mace or pepper spray and flashed lights in their faces. As she tried to get away, Hamilton said, she was repeatedly struck in the chest and abdomen. One of the journalists\u00a0confronted the attackers and shoved one before he was pummeled to the ground and beaten, according to video footage of the incident. \u2018I was expecting us to start working on an obituary\u2019 The day after the attack, UCLA\u2019s chancellor called the events\u00a0\u201ca\u00a0dark\u00a0chapter\u201d in the school\u2019s history that \u201chas shaken our campus to its core.\u201d A\u00a0parent\u00a0who was at the encampment with\u00a0their\u00a0child, a UCLA student, also described\u00a0the night\u00a0as feeling like \u201ca civil war movie\u201d with embers raining down and the wounded being treated all around.\u00a0The parent said they were\u00a0frantic to find help, calling UCLA campus police six times in a row. One fourth-year UCLA student \u2013 who requested anonymity due to safety concerns \u2013 told CNN he was hit in the corner of his forehead with a traffic cone. Minutes later, video captured a counterprotester smashing a wooden plank into the back of his head. With two deep cuts on his head, he said he rushed to the hospital and ultimately received 14 staples and three stitches for the injuries. The violence directed at the protesters and his access to medical treatment reminded him of why they had set up the encampment in the first place,\u00a0trying to raise awareness about the mass deaths and destruction from Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, and calling for the university to divest from any financial ties with Israel.\u00a0\u201cI had the privilege of going to a hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Gaza, there are zero fully functioning hospitals.\u201d Thistle Boosinger, a 23-year-old member of the encampment who is not a UCLA student, had her hand smashed the night of the violence. She described how her assailant took a piece of wood above his head before slamming it down on her hand. \u201cAt first, I just screamed,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then after like five minutes where my adrenaline wore off, it was so extremely painful.\u201d In a video call, Boosinger held up her hand wrapped in gauze and described her injury. \u201cMy bone is broken totally in half below my knuckle \u2026 [which is] shattered into a bunch of pieces and jumbled up.\u201d Dylan Kupsh, a UCLA graduate student, said he linked arms with other protesters in an attempt to defend the encampment and keep people safe. \u201cWe were \u2026 trying to keep the barricade wall up because that was literally protecting our lives,\u201d Kupsh said. It wasn\u2019t long before he was pepper sprayed, forcing him to seek medical treatment as the attacks continued. Kupsh and others still wonder what would have happened had the encampment been breached that night. \u201cI hate to say it,\u201d said Catherine Hamilton, the student journalist, \u201cbut I was expecting us to start working on an obituary the next day because I thought something that serious would happen to the students in the encampment.\u201d Do you have information to share about the attack at UCLA?

{"id": "2024_05_15_us_florida-bus-crash-driver-court", "text": "The man accused of driving under the influence and causing the deaths of eight farm workers in a crash in north-central Florida told\u00a0officers he\u00a0smoked\u00a0marijuana\u00a0oil\u00a0the\u00a0night\u00a0before\u00a0the\u00a0incident, an arrest report says. Bryan Maclean Howard, 41, faces eight charges of DUI manslaughter stemming from Tuesday\u2019s fatal crash, in which authorities said the 2001 Ford Ranger he was driving traveled toward the center line along Highway 40 west of Ocala and struck a bus carrying more than 50 farm workers. The bus left the roadway, went through a fence and overturned, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. In addition to the eight dead, at least 40 people were injured. Howard pleaded not guilty on Wednesday, online records show. He has been denied bond. CNN has reached out to the public defender\u2019s office for comment. The six\u00a0victims identified\u00a0in\u00a0the arrest\u00a0report were Evarado Ventura Hern\u00e1ndez, 30; Cristian Salazar Villeda, 24; Alfredo Tovar S\u00e1nchez, 20; Isa\u00edas Miranda Pascal, 21; Jos\u00e9 Heriberto Fraga Acosta, 27, and Manuel Perez R\u00edos, 46. Howard told authorities he\u00a0smoked\u00a0marijuana\u00a0oil\u00a0with a friend\u00a0the\u00a0night\u00a0before\u00a0the\u00a0crash, according to\u00a0the report, and also told police he took three prescribed medications\u00a0before\u00a0going to bed around 11:30 p.m. Citing Howard\u2019s involvement in a car accident \u201cat least three days prior\u201d to the bus crash, a state judge Wednesday also stipulated he is not allowed to operate a motor vehicle while the case is pending, nor may he consume or possess alcohol, a controlled substance or a drug without a prescription. Howard said he did not remember how\u00a0the\u00a0accident\u00a0happened and he was \u201cdriving very carefully\u201d because he was\u00a0involved\u00a0in\u00a0the car\u00a0accident days\u00a0before,\u00a0the\u00a0report says. A prosecutor Wednesday asked the judge to deny bond, in part based on Howard\u2019s criminal history. She listed\u00a0a litany of convictions, many stemming from driving-related infractions and all confirmed by state court records, including that Howard was: \u2022 Found guilty in 2019 of leaving the scene of an accident with property damage \u2022 Twice convicted \u2013 in 2013 and 2018 \u2013 of driving while his license was suspended, canceled or revoked \u2022 Convicted of grand theft in 2013 \u2022 Convicted of leaving the scene of an accident in 2006 CNN has reached out for comment to the public defender\u2019s office.
