{"id": "2024_06_26_us_jocelyn-nungaray-killing-houston", "text": "Two undocumented Venezuelan men have been charged with capital murder in the killing this month of a 12-year-old girl in Houston, the latest case to underscore the pivotal role immigration continues to play in US politics and the upcoming presidential election. Johan Jose Martinez-Rangel, 22, and\u00a0Franklin Jose Pe\u00f1a Ramos, 26, were arrested June 20, three days after the strangled body of Jocelyn Nungaray was found in a shallow creek, according to the Houston Police Department. A judge this week ordered each man held on a $10 million bond, court records show. Both men are Venezuelan nationals who entered the US illegally, a spokesperson for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement told CNN. It\u2019s\u00a0unclear when and where they entered the\u00a0country, the spokesperson said, but each was apprehended near El Paso by US Border Patrol \u2013\u00a0Martinez-Rangel on\u00a0March\u00a014\u00a0and Pe\u00f1a Ramos on May\u00a028\u00a0\u2013 and released with a notice to appear in court in the future. An attorney for Pe\u00f1a Ramos declined to comment.\u00a0An attorney for\u00a0Martinez-Rangel did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Republicans and right-wing media have\u00a0pointed to the case as a consequence of\u00a0the immigration policies of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration as they seek\u00a0to draw a contrast with his rival, former President Donald Trump. \u201cThat little girl would be alive today if Biden enforced immigration laws at the border,\u201d GOP Gov. Greg Abbott said on X following the suspects\u2019 arrests. Trump, who will face Biden Thursday in CNN\u2019s Presidential Debate, has echoed as much, saying in a speech over the weekend both suspects \u201cwould not have been in our country\u201d if he were president, despite the fact similar crimes\u00a0occurred during his time in office.\u00a0He also pointed\u00a0to the cases of two women who authorities say were killed in the past year by\u00a0men\u00a0who crossed into the country illegally: Georgia nursing student Laken Riley\u00a0and Maryland mother Rachel Morin. Asked Wednesday about the cases, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said, \u201cOur hearts are with the families of the victims.\u201d \u201cThe criminals who committed these heinous acts must be held responsible with the fullest force of the law,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan. \u201cWe will hold the criminals accountable.\u201d Jocelyn\u2019s body was found along West Rankin Road in north Houston early in the morning of June 17, authorities have said. Detectives got surveillance footage from the area showing the suspects together at a restaurant the prior evening, Lt. Stephen Hope of the Houston Police Department said at a news conference after their arrests. The pair left on foot and were later seen meeting and talking with Jocelyn, Hope said, before all three walked to a convenience store. A few minutes later, Hope said, Jocelyn and the men went to the bridge where \u201cultimately, Jocelyn was murdered,\u201d Hope said.\u00a0The suspects left, he said, before returning to a residence they shared. On June 20, Houston police found the suspects at an apartment complex where they were arrested without incident, Hope said, crediting the community with helping police throughout the investigation. At this time, the charges against the suspects do not carry eligibility for the death penalty, Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said at a news conference Monday, according to footage from CNN affiliate KHOU, adding forensic evidence is still being examined. The decision on whether to seek a death sentence would not be unilaterally made by Ogg, she said. Her office has a committee that makes that choice based on the evidence and the feelings of the victim\u2019s family. At that news conference, Alexis Nungaray, Jocelyn\u2019s mother, said it had been \u201ca very, very hard time\u201d for her family, telling reporters she kept seeing \u201csigns\u201d that reminded her of Jocelyn in the days following her death. \u201cI know this is a very high-profile case,\u201d Nungaray said, \u201cbut she was still my firstborn. I was a teen mom, I fought for her at 15. I\u2019m 27 now, and I\u2019m still fighting for her.\u201d \u201cJust remember that she was a very special little girl that deserves her justice.\u201d CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated when the two men entered the US. The date is unknown, according to ICE.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/us/jocelyn-nungaray-killing-houston/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_politics_primaries-maga-squad-what-matters", "text": "There must be some sort of larger takeaway in the fact that Rep. Lauren Boebert, among the most MAGA members of Congress, won a Republican primary in Colorado on Tuesday night, and Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a member of the progressive \u201cSquad\u201d from the Bronx, lost a Democratic primary to a more moderate candidate from Westchester County in New York. Every House race is different, obviously, since all politics is local, according to the old saying. So it would be an oversimplification to say that Republicans moved more MAGA and Democrats moved more moderate based on these two unrelated races. More MAGA or moderate? And yet there\u2019s evidence to support that general trend. Look no further than the two parties\u2019 presidential candidates. Former President Donald Trump personifies MAGA, and a large part of the Make America Great Again ethos he pushes is loyalty to him. President Joe Biden, on the other hand, effectively worked with Republicans to pass a bill to improve the nation\u2019s infrastructure and has said he wants to work with Republicans on immigration reform. Many Republicans will tell you they don\u2019t believe Biden. There\u2019s nothing moderate about either Boebert or Bowman, who occupy space on the fringe of their respective parties. Both were also seriously flawed candidates with problems that extend beyond policy. Boebert was kicked out of a theater last year for vaping and \u201ccausing a disturbance,\u201d for instance. Bowman was charged last year with pulling a fire alarm in a House office building when there was no emergency. Rather than face voters in the district she narrowly won two years ago, Boebert moved to run in a district with a more conservative voting record. She emerged from a crowded field to win the Republican primary in the district, which was previously represented by Rep. Ken Buck, a conservative Republican who is a critic of Trump and had resigned from office in frustration. Bowman, on the other hand, was targeted by more mainstream Democrats in part for his loud criticism of Israel in its war on Hamas in Gaza, an issue that has split Democrats this year. Pro-Israel groups spent heavily in the race, attempting to oust Bowman. However, in advertising, Bowman was attacked more for his opposition to Biden\u2019s policies than for his position on Israel. Evidence of a liberal retreat I asked CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg, who covered the Bowman race, why he thinks Bowman lost and what it says about Democrats today. Here\u2019s what he emailed back: KRIEG: There are obviously many ways to read Bowman\u2019s defeat, and his failure to bridge the gap with pro-Israel Jewish voters in the district, specifically in Westchester, is understandably the one you\u2019re hearing most often. But I also think, if we\u2019re looking at this through a national lens, it\u2019s hard to not see it as part of the broader liberal retreat from some of the more aggressive left-wing characters and candidates they embraced during Trump\u2019s presidency.\u00a0 For all the talk about Democrats\u2019 lack of enthusiasm about Biden personally, the idea of Biden \u2013 the moderate, even-tempered statesman type \u2013 is still very, very popular. And (Westchester County Executive George) Latimer, to some extent, embodied that.  It obviously did not help Bowman that AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) and other outside groups bombarded him with record spending and gobs of money invested in research into every thought that\u2019s crossed his mind the last 25 years.  That primary voters did not hold the spending against Latimer, as progressives argued they should, also reminds me that voters (especially Democrats) in presidential cycles tend to be cautious. You\u2019ll probably never hear Trump, Fox News or anyone on the right mention Latimer\u2019s name. And for some folks left-of-center, that\u2019s priceless. Utah went its own way While Boebert\u2019s victory provides a foil for Bowman\u2019s loss, it was far from a perfect night for more MAGA Republicans. In a separate Colorado race, the chair of the state GOP, Dave Williams, who had gotten Trump\u2019s endorsement but who said controversial things about gay rights \u2013 including that Pride flags should be burned \u2013 lost to the more establishment pick, Jeff Crank, a real estate investor and former talk radio host. And in Utah, Republicans snubbed the MAGA options for both governor and senator in a state that is very conservative but where the base of Mormon voters has bristled at the former president. Current Sen. Mitt Romney is a notable Trump critic in the GOP, and his decision not to run for reelection opened up an opportunity to replace one of the few remaining Republicans who voted to convict Trump on impeachment charges in 2021 with a Trump-backed Republican. Rep. John Curtis, the winner of the GOP Senate primary, did not vote to convict Trump as a member of the House, but he is the rare Republican focused on climate change, an issue that disproportionately affects Utah but which Trump dismisses. The larger problem \u2026 Both Curtis and Gov. Spencer Cox were actually rejected by GOP party activists at the state\u2019s nominating convention but found their way onto the ballot with the help of signature drives. Cox has taken more moderate positions on certain issues and was booed at the state GOP convention this year,\u00a0according to The Associated Press. But Cox and Curtis both easily won their primaries, which essentially determine the winner of statewide contests in a state like Utah. It\u2019s a shame that primary voters are becoming the de facto general election voters in states and districts that lean heavily to one side or the other, according to former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican who wrote a lament in The Washington Post that most of the country lives in a state with \u201ctrifecta\u201d government, where one party controls most of what\u2019s happening at their state level. Daniels writes: The issue isn\u2019t simply that states lean reliably Republican or Democratic. It\u2019s that now a big majority are heavily, maybe irrevocably, tilted in one direction or the other. Where that obtains, office seekers pitch their initial appeals to the hard core on their side, as primary candidates always have. The difference is that, instead of the winner\u2019s traditional post-primary imperative, to reach out to nonpartisans and even open-minded members of the opposing party, now their job is finished. There are efforts to change this dynamic, which we\u2019ve written about in this newsletter, such as in states experimenting with nonpartisan primaries and ranked-choice voting. But Daniels has a point. None of the races we\u2019ve discussed so far in this story are expected to be at all competitive in November.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/politics/primaries-maga-squad-what-matters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "us"}}

Jeanne Whitefeather, 62 and Donald Lantz, 63, who are both White, have been charged with human trafficking of children, civil rights violations, use of a minor child in forced labor and child neglect, according to the 17-count indictment. Madison Tuck, assistant prosecuting attorney for Kanawha County, West Virginia, told CNN Wednesday that the trial is set to begin on September 9. Tuck said the children are \u201call safe\u201d but declined to give further details about their location. Lantz and Whitefeather entered not guilty pleas during a June 11 arraignment. Mark Plants, an attorney representing Whitefeather, told CNN Thursday that his client \u201cabsolutely, emphatically (denies) the allegations.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re talking about two parents who adopted five Black children, has cared for them for the last eight years, and this is going to come out at trial. And we\u2019ll let the jury decide at the end of the day. But we absolutely, emphatically deny the allegations.\u201d Lantz\u2019s attorney did not immediately return requests for comment. During the arraignment, Thirteenth Judicial Circuit Judge Maryclaire Akers said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen an indictment like this in all of my time.\u201d Akers, referencing the indictment, said it alleges the children were \u201ctargeted because of their race\u201d to be used \u201cas basically slaves.\u201d CNN has obtained court documents related to the case, which began in October 2023 when Kanawha County Sheriff\u2019s deputies responded to a 911 call raising concerns about the children. CNN requested a copy of the 911 call, but authorities declined to release it.  The 911 caller reported the children were \u201cmade to do farm work\u201d and \u201cnot allowed inside the house,\u201d according to a sworn statement from the deputy who responded to the call. A news release from the sheriff\u2019s office noted that \u201cdeputies had to force entry into the barn where they located a juvenile male and juvenile female locked inside an approximate 20x14 foot room.\u201d \u201cThe children had no means to exit the barn on their own, no running water, no bathroom facilities, and were obviously deprived of adequate hygienic care and food,\u201d the release said. According to the deputy\u2019s sworn statement, \u201cthe female juvenile also stated she and her 14-year-old brother were not allowed inside the house.\u201d \u201cThere were no accessible windows in the room or way for the children to exit. If there were a medical emergency or fire, the children would be unable to exit the locked room to safety,\u201d the statement said.  When Whitefeather and Lantz arrived hours later, the deputy wrote, \u201cMs. Whitefeather made the admission to Det. Alford that the children were left in the shed but stated they \u2018like it.\u2019\u201d An affidavit from a lieutenant in the sheriff\u2019s office indicated that the police encounter in October 2023 was preceded by two other concerned 911 calls about the wellbeing of the children. Both callers, in May and June 2023, told dispatchers that children living there were \u201csleeping in the barn\u201d and using a portable toilet outside, according to the affidavit. Both times, Whitefeather and Lantz claimed to responding deputies that they had just moved to the site from Washington State and were using the portable toilet due to plumbing issues in their new home, the statement said. \u201cMs. Whitefeather told the deputies that people in the area don\u2019t like them, and vehicles had been stopping on the roadway in front of their residence,\u201d the lieutenant wrote of the June 2023 encounter. \u201cThis call was cleared with \u2018no police action necessary.\u2019\u201d A grand jury returned an indictment against Whitefeather and Lantz in May that allege, among other things, that the couple did \u201cknowingly, feloniously, and willfully traffic a minor,\u201d and \u201cdid recruit, entice, and obtain the victim of the offense from a shelter and facility that serves runaway youths, children in foster care, the homeless and victims of human trafficking, domestic violence and sexual assault.\u201d The pair are each being held on $500,000 \u201ccash-only\u201d bonds, according to an arraignment order.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/us/west-virginia-adopted-black-children-slaves-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_business_economy-election-presidential-debate", "text": "Bill Clinton\u2019s campaign was right on the money when it coined the famous \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d phrase in 1992. That\u2019s because the economy has consistently ranked among the top \u2014 if not the very top \u2014 voter issues in presidential election after presidential election. The current contest is far from an exception, with close to 90% of respondents in a May ABC News/Ipsos poll indicating that the economy is the most important issue in determining who gets their vote in November. That means it\u2019s all but guaranteed to be a major talking point during Thursday night\u2019s debate, which kicks off at 9 pm ET on CNN. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have polar opposite views on the economy \u2014 and both undoubtedly will try to sell you on their visions, policies and records. To make heads or tails of what they say (or if you\u2019re trying to impress anyone you might be watching the debate with), it\u2019s good to make sure you understand the economy we\u2019re in right now. Disclaimer: The topics below are in no way an exhaustive list of everything going on in the US economy, plus, everyone experiences it differently. Unemployment: Low, but with warning signs ahead The nation\u2019s unemployment rate stayed below 4% for 27 months, its longest such streak and a match for a period in the 1960s. That streak ended last month, when the unemployment rate rose to 4% from 3.9%. At the same time, the number of job openings in the US recently fell to a new three-year low, another sign of cooling in the labor market. That means job seekers might find it harder to get hired. In particular, the job market for recent college graduates has weakened. The unemployment rate for bachelor\u2019s degree recipients aged 20 to 29 is above 12%, an almost four-percentage-point increase from a year ago, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Inflation: Elevated, but cooling Inflation slowed more than expected last month, falling to 3.3% from 3.4% in April. By comparison, at this time last year it was 4%, and two years ago it was 9%. But there\u2019s a reason why you\u2019re probably feeling like everything is still really expensive. While discounts are starting to appear more at big-box retailers like Target and Walmart and fast-food giants like McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s, price cuts aren\u2019t occurring across the board. That\u2019s because when inflation cools off, it simply means that the pace of price increases is slowing. However, it does not mean that the actual prices we pay for goods and services are lower than they were a year ago. Housing: Still unaffordable Home prices are at a record high and have been climbing for 11 straight months as housing shortages persist. That\u2019s partly because many homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgages during the pandemic don\u2019t want to move and risk having to pay a much higher mortgage rate. Average 30-year fixed-rate mortgages recently hit the highest level of the year. While they\u2019ve started to fall, mortgage rates are still higher than anything seen in the decade before 2022. Mortgage rates are so high in part because inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. As a result, the central bank has held off cutting interest rates, which would otherwise make it cheaper to get a mortgage. In turn, many would-be homebuyers are renting for longer than they otherwise may have, which is driving rents higher, too.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/business/economy-election-presidential-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_us_las-vegas-shootings", "text": "An overnight manhunt for a gunman sought in the deaths of five people in North Las Vegas ended Tuesday morning after police located him just before he killed himself. Eric Adams, 47, was identified by police as a suspect in two shootings on Monday night, according to a news release from the North Las Vegas Police Department. Five people were killed and a 13-year-old girl was hospitalized in critical condition with a gunshot wound after the shooting spree at two apartments. The shooting started when an argument broke out between the suspect and his ex-girlfriend while he was visiting her apartment, police said Thursday in an updated news release. Around 10 p.m. on Monday, police received reports of a shooting at an apartment complex on Casa Norte Drive, the release said. When they arrived, police located two adult females \u2013 one in her early 40s and another in her late 50s \u2013 with gunshot wounds. They were later pronounced dead by medical personnel, according to police. \u201cThe two got into a domestic-related argument, during which Adams armed himself with a gun and shot two other women in the apartment,\u201d the Thursday news release said. Police later located a third victim, a 13-year-old female, who also had a gunshot wound and remains in critical condition at UMC Trauma Center as of Thursday, police told CNN in an email. Three more victims were with gunshot wounds were found at another apartment in the same complex, police said Thursday \u2013 Adams\u2019 ex-girlfriend\u2019s 24-year-old daughter and her 22-year-old friend, along with a 20-year-old man. All three were pronounced dead at the scene, police said. The 20-year-old victim, who was an upstairs neighbor, heard the commotion and decided to check on the women to see if he could help, police said. Adams then shot him when he arrived at the apartment, police said. At that point, the suspect went upstairs and shot three people who were inside that apartment, including a 59-year-old woman, a 40-year-old woman and the teenage girl, police said. Two other people were inside the apartment but were left unharmed. Police then identified Adams as a suspect and the manhunt began overnight. After the shootings, Adams took his ex-girlfriend hostage and fled the area, police said. At some point in the early hours of Tuesday morning, the ex-girlfriend escaped unharmed and found a nearby Las Vegas Metropolitan Police officer to ask for help. Police searched throughout the night for Adams until around 10 a.m. on Tuesday, when they received a tip that he was at a business on East Lake Mead Boulevard. When police arrived at that area, Adams fled to the backyard of a nearby residence. \u201cOfficers began giving Adams verbal commands to drop the firearm, however, Adams ignored those commands and died by suicide,\u201d the release says. Police are continuing their investigation into the incident. \u201cThe surviving victims and their families are being assisted by the North Las Vegas Police Department, victim advocates and detectives, to help them through this difficult time,\u201d police said Thursday.

{"id": "2024_06_24_us_ramiro-gonzales-execution-texas-parole-board", "text": "Texas\u2019 parole board on Monday denied clemency for death row inmate Ramiro Gonzales, who is scheduled to be executed Wednesday for a 2001 murder, despite the fact a key expert witness no longer stands by his testimony at trial. Gonzales, 41, had asked the Board of Pardons and Paroles to recommend clemency, which would allow GOP Gov. Greg Abbott to commute the inmate\u2019s sentence to a lesser punishment, like life in prison without parole, for the 2001 sexual assault and killing of 18-year-old Bridget Townsend. Gonzales and his attorneys pointed to his traumatic upbringing and his rehabilitation \u2013 illustrated by his Christian faith \u2013 as reasons to spare his life, the petition shows. In a pair of brief orders Wednesday, the US Supreme Court rejected a last-minute appeal from Gonzales to pause his execution. Gonzales on Monday had asked the high court for a stay of execution after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected an appeal in which the inmate argued his trial jury\u2019s determination that he would remain a dangerous threat \u2013 a requirement for a capital sentence in Texas \u2013 was based on testimony by an expert witness who relied on data later found to be false. And it was ultimately wrong, his attorneys argued, as shown by Gonzales\u2019 redemption behind bars and his earlier attempts to donate a kidney. Thus, Gonzales should be ineligible for execution, his attorneys contended, and executing him would violate his constitutional rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Additionally, they argued Texas had violated his Constitutional rights by requiring a finding of \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d for a capital sentence without providing an opportunity for it to be reviewed in post-conviction proceedings. Gonzales and his attorneys advanced similar arguments in their appeals before the US Supreme Court. His lawyers told the Supreme Court Gonzales has \u201cgrown into a mature, peaceful, kind, loving, and deeply religious adult.\u201d His attorneys argued it would violate the Constitution to execute someone who did not meet the eligibility criteria for a death sentence on state law. The state rejected that argument in its own briefing, accusing Gonzales of waiting \u201cuntil the eleventh hour to raise these claims\u201d and attempting to \u201cbypass\u201d lower courts. The Texas parole board voted 7-0 against recommending a commutation of sentence or a 180-day reprieve. His attorneys were \u201cdeeply saddened and disappointed\u201d by the decision, they said in a statement. \u201cIf Ramiro is executed on Wednesday, the world will be a darker place without him,\u201d the attorneys said. Without the board\u2019s recommendation, Abbott is limited by state law to issuing a one-time 30-day reprieve. The planned execution of Gonzales, who was previously slated to be put to death in July 2022 before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals granted a stay, is one of two scheduled this week in the United States. On Thursday, Oklahoma intends to execute Richard Rojem, who was convicted of the 1984 kidnapping, rape and murder of his 7-year-old stepdaughter, Layla Cummings, court records show. Last week, the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole board voted against recommending clemency for Rojem, who claims he is innocent, CNN affiliate KOCO reported. If both Gonzales and Rojem are put to death, their executions would be the eighth and ninth to take place in the nation this year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a non-profit that monitors and analyzes information about capital punishment and has been critical of its administration. Both would be the second person to be executed in their respective states in 2024. By this time last year, 13 inmates had been put to death in the US, the center\u2019s data shows. In the Texas case, the Medina County Criminal District Attorney\u2019s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CNN has tried to reach members of Townsend\u2019s family for comment. The murder of Bridget Townsend One day in January 2001, Gonzales called the home of his drug supplier, who was Townsend\u2019s boyfriend, according to a court of appeals opinion from 2009 affirming the inmate\u2019s conviction and death sentence. Townsend answered, the opinion states, and told Gonzales her boyfriend was at work. Gonzales then went to the home in search of drugs, and he stole money and tied Towsend\u2019s hands and feet before kidnapping her. He then drove her to a spot near his family\u2019s ranch, where he raped and fatally shot her, the court opinion says. In October 2002, while sitting in a county jail in connection to the rape of another woman, Gonzales confessed to Townsend\u2019s killing and led authorities to her body, court records show. Gonzales was 18 when he murdered Townsend, his clemency petition says, contending he was in the throes of drug addiction that was \u201ccompounded by the trauma and neglect that marked his childhood,\u201d his clemency petition states. Gonzales\u2019 mother drank and used drugs during her pregnancy and gave her son to her parents when he was born, the petition claims. She had two other children whom she raised, it says, but didn\u2019t acknowledge Gonzales as her son. The petition also says Gonzales was sexually abused throughout his childhood, beginning at age 6. Gonzales began using drugs in his teens, after his aunt \u2013 with whom he was close \u2013 was killed by a drunken driver, causing him \u201cinconsolable grief,\u201d the petition says. \u201cIn the years that followed, Ramiro\u2019s life spiraled out of control,\u201d it says. Inmate no longer poses a threat, appeal says During his years on death row, Gonzales has become a \u201cliving testament to the power of rehabilitation and human capacity for growth and change,\u201d his attorneys argued this month in his appeal before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. He has become \u201cdeeply religious,\u201d has \u201ccommitted no criminal acts of violence\u201d and has tried to atone for his crimes \u2013 in part by trying to donate a kidney. Ahead of his last execution date, Gonzales sought a 30-day reprieve so he could participate in an altruistic kidney donation. But the Texas Department of Criminal Justice deemed him ineligible under its health care policy, a spokesperson told CNN at the time, because an organ transplant would introduce an \u201cuncertain timeline\u201d that might interfere with an execution date. Gonzales\u2019 attorneys said that\u2019s just one example of Gonzales\u2019 \u201cgrowth and rehabilitation,\u201d also citing his commitment to his faith and ministry to others on death row, according to the recent appeal. Taken together, Gonzales\u2019 attorneys said, this evidence exhibits the inmate is no longer a threat to society, disproving a finding made by his jury at trial that was required for him to be sentenced to death. Additionally, Gonzales\u2019 lawyers argued the evidence jurors relied upon to make the determination of future dangerousness was wrong: An expert witness for the state testified during the penalty phase of the inmate\u2019s trial that he had diagnosed Gonzales with antisocial personality disorder, and that \u201clots of data\u201d showed sex offenders were likely to continue to commit crimes, citing in part recidivism data. That data has since been found to be inaccurate, and the expert in 2021 evaluated Gonzales and has recanted his testimony, including the diagnosis, Gonzales\u2019 appeal stated. The expert told The Marshall Project he had never changed his opinion in a capital case prior to this one, calling it \u201cthe exception, not the rule.\u201d When the Court of Criminal Appeals halted Gonzales\u2019 last execution, it sent the case back to his trial court to review the expert\u2019s testimony and whether it impacted the jury\u2019s decision. Gonzales\u2019 appeal said the state recommended relief be denied and that the lower court agreed without holding a hearing. The appeals court ultimately denied relief in June 2023.

Madalina\u2019s mother, Diana Cojocari, 37, and stepfather, Christopher Palmiter, 60,\u00a0were arrested on December 17\u00a0for failure to report the disappearance of a child to law enforcement, police said. In May, Cojocari was convicted of failure to report the disappearance, after changing her plea to guilty without a plea agreement, Mecklenburg County court records show. She was sentenced to a minimum of six and a maximum of 17 months in prison, according to the judgment in the case. CNN has reached out to Cojocari\u2019s attorney, Daniel Powers Roberts, regarding her new status as a suspect in the case. The Mecklenburg District Attorney\u2019s Office referred any additional questions to the Cornelius Police Department. CNN has reached out to police for additional information. \u201cWe want to #FindMadalina. This has been our priority since we learned she was missing. Please continue to share her picture on social media to help us and call us if you have any information that can help our detectives at 704-892-7773,\u201d police said in the Tuesday update posted on Facebook. Madalina was last seen at her home on November 23, but her parents took until December 15 to report her missing to a resource officer at her school, Bailey Middle School. According to the probable cause affidavits filed by police in the case, both adults denied knowledge of Madalina\u2019s whereabouts. A search warrant issued in March revealed Madalina\u2019s mother and grandmother discussed a theory that Palmiter \u201cgave the girl away for money\u201d during a recorded jail phone call. They also discussed a \u201cbag with money\u201d and \u201cwithdrawing cash,\u201d the warrant says. Investigators then asked for access to bank records, the warrant shows, which they believed would \u201callow investigators to establish a financial pattern for Chris Palmiter and may contain information pertaining to the disappearance of Madalina.\u201d During another recorded jail phone call between Palmiter and his brother and sister-in-law, Palmiter mentioned the girl\u2019s mother \u201chad a lot of cash with her and he did not know where it came from.\u201d Palmiter also told his family there was \u201cfinancial stuff\u201d coming up and his brother told him not to worry about it, the warrant states. Officers searched the family\u2019s home in December and seized more than two dozen items, including three cell phones,\u00a0CNN previously reported. Other items taken in the search were redacted from an inventory document. Madalina was last seen wearing jeans; pink, purple and white Adidas shoes; and a white T-shirt and jacket, authorities said. The FBI described her as 4-foot-10 inches and weighing 90 pounds, and a photo released to the public shows a smiling girl wearing a shirt that reads, \u201cI can change the world with love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/us/madalina-cojocari-missing-mother-suspect/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_us_minneapolis-juror-bribery-indictment", "text": "Federal charges have been filed against five people linked to a recent attempt to\u00a0bribe a juror\u00a0to help secure a not guilty verdict in a trial over a $250 million fraud scheme that exploited a federally funded child nutrition program, the US attorney in Minnesota announced in a news conference Wednesday. The juror, identified only as \u201cJuror 52,\u201d immediately called 911 to report the attempt after a gift bag containing $120,000 in cash was dropped off at her front door earlier this month, FBI Special Agent\u00a0Travis Wilmer said in an affidavit filed June 3 in federal court. Three of those charged this week, Abdimajid Nur, Abdiaziz Farah and Said Farah, were defendants in the fraud trial connected to Feeding Our Future, a nonprofit organization prosecutors say was used to skim nearly $250 million from federal child nutrition programs. Juror 52, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, was dismissed from the case and replaced with an alternate. Nur and Abdiaziz Farah were convicted of wire fraud, bribery, money laundering, conspriacy and other crimes, while Said Farah was acquitted, according to a Justice Department news release and agency spokesperson Tasha Zerna. Court documents state Juror 52 was targeted \u201cbecause she was the youngest juror and they believed her to be the only juror of color.\u201d Included with the alleged bribery money was a document described by US Attorney Andrew Luger as \u201cchilling.\u201d The document laid out instructions for the juror to follow with arguments for her to use to sway other jurors, the indictment states. Those arguments focus on an assertion of prejudice by the government based on the defendants\u2019 immigration status and race, according to the indictment. Luger said the note inside the gift bag also included a clear message to the juror that read, \u201cYou alone can end this case.\u201d Nur recruited Ladan Ali, a woman who \u201cattempted to follow\u201d the juror home after the first day of closing arguments and two days later dropped off the gift bag containing the bribery money at the juror\u2019s house and gave it to a relative, the indictment says. Said Farah allegedly provided the funds. Another defendant, Abdulkarim Farah, accompanied Ali and videotaped her dropping off the money, according to the indictment.\u00a0Abdiaziz Farah, Said Farah and Abdulkarim Farah are brothers. CNN has reached out to attorneys for all five defendants for comment. The\u00a0charges they face\u00a0include bribery of a juror, conspiracy to bribe a juror and corruptly influencing a juror. When the\u00a0alleged\u00a0bribery attempt was announced in court, all defendants in the trial were ordered to turn their phones in to authorities. Abdiaziz Farah engaged a factory reset\u00a0in an attempt to wipe\u00a0all the data from his device, according to court documents.\u00a0He also faces a count of obstruction of justice connected to that allegation. Recovered videos from the phones of the defendants include recordings of the bribe money being dropped off at Juror 52\u2019s home, according to the indictment. \u201cThey took the video to ensure that the money was delivered and as evidence to show Juror 52\u2019s complicity if she accepted the bribe but did not follow through with a not guilty verdict,\u201d the indictment states. Days later, a search warrant was served at Abdiaziz Farah\u2019s home, and among the items found by investigators was a list of all the jurors\u2019\u00a0names hidden inside a water bottle,\u00a0a DOJ warrant shows. Fingerprints from the bag of money led investigators to Ladan\u00a0Ali,\u00a0Luger said.\u00a0During Wednesday\u2019s news conference, Luger shared surveillance images he says show Ali in a rental car following\u00a0Juror\u00a052 home from court. \u201cThis is more than just a mob movie. This is a chilling attack on our system of justice,\u201d he added. \u201cThey studied her, followed her and determined that she would succumb to their scheme. The fact that they failed does not lessen the magnitude of what they tried to do,\u201d said Luger. \u201cFortunately for all of us, Juror 52 could not be bought, and she terminated their scheme.\u201d \u201cThe sophistication and intentionality of this plot cannot be overstated,\u201d said Luger, adding Juror 52\u2019s movements were tracked night and day. The three Farah brothers are scheduled to make their initial appearances on the charges in federal court Thursday afternoon. Ladan Ali is expected to turn herself in later this week, and Abdimajid Nur is set to appear in court next week, according to Zerna.

{"id": "2024_06_27_business_walgreens-closures", "text": "Walgreens is set to close a substantial number of its roughly 8,600 locations across the United States as the company looks to reset the struggling pharmaceutical chain\u2019s business. The company didn\u2019t announce a specific number of store closures, but it said Thursday that it is planning \u201csignificant\u201d closures of underperforming\u00a0stores across America as part of a multiyear optimization program. CEO Tim Wentworth said on a call with analysts Thursday that \u201cchanges are imminent\u201d for the roughly 25% of stores that aren\u2019t profitable and Walgreens\u2019 strategic review will \u201cinclude the closure\u00a0of a significant\u00a0portion of these underperforming stores.\u201d \u201cWe are at a point where the current pharmacy model is not sustainable and the challenges in our operating environment require we approach the market differently,\u201d he said. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal Thursday, Wentworth said the closures would focus on locations that aren\u2019t profitable, too close to each other or stores struggling with theft. Walgreens revealed few additional details about the closures on the call, but said they would take place over the next three years. The company also said it will consider additional closures if performance doesn\u2019t improve. The \u201cvast majority\u201d of employees working at affected stores will be offered jobs elsewhere, Wentworth said. Stock plunges on weak outlook Walgreens\u2019 (WBA) shares fell 20% to its lowest level in decades. The company also said in its earnings statement that it has slashed its full-year profit outlook. \u201cWe continue to face a difficult operating environment, including persistent pressures on the\u00a0US\u00a0consumer and the impact of recent marketplace dynamics which have eroded pharmacy margins,\u201d Wentworth said in a press release. \u201cOur results and outlook reflect these headwinds.\u201d Inflation has taken a big bite out of the drug store business \u2013 both at the front-end and the back-end of pharmacies. Shoppers are \u201cbecoming increasingly selective\u00a0and price sensitive\u00a0on their selections,\u201d Wentworth said on the call, adding that he forecasts the \u201coperating environment to remain challenging\u201d in the US and doesn\u2019t \u201cexpect an improvement.\u201d Sales rose 2.6% to $36.4 billion for the quarter. That might not \u201clook unreasonable, but this is running below inflation and, across some segments of the business, represents a loss of market share,\u201d Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in a note. Particularly concerning for Walgreens was its retail sales falling 4% for the quarter. But that isn\u2019t surprising because it\u2019s front-of-store struggles have been \u201cexacerbated by the cost-of-living crisis which has seen customers curtailing the volume of products they buy and shopping around more for the best deals and bargains,\u201d Saunders added. Walgreens slashed prices on more than 1,000 items in May, following rivals in an effort to lure back inflation-weary shoppers turned off by high prices. But the company said Thursday that would hurt its profitability. Struggles for drug stores Major drugstore chains, including CVS (CVS) and Rite Aid, have struggled in recent years because of declining profits from filling prescriptions. They\u2019ve declined because of lower reimbursement rates for prescription drugs and new competition from Amazon. The front end of drugstores, where they sell snacks and household staples, also face pressure from larger competitors, including Target and dollar stores. Wentworth said in the call that Walgreens\u2019 store assortment will change and it has removed eight national brands and instead started selling similar items produced by its house brands or \u201cpreferred partners.\u201d He didn\u2019t specify which brands that have been eliminated, but said it was within the health and wellness categories. Although drugstores benefited during the pandemic from people getting Covid-19 vaccines, fewer consumers are visiting stores to shop. Prescription volumes are also falling because people are getting fewer elective procedures. GLP-1 drugs, which include Ozempic and Mounjaro to treat weight loss and diabetes hasn\u2019t been a boon for the chain. Wentworth told the Journal it\u2019s losing money on filling those prescriptions. Pivoting the business model hasn\u2019t helped, either. Walgreens will no longer have a majority stake in VillageMD, a primary care network that the chain once had major plans to open full-service doctors\u2019 offices in hundreds of its stores. Walgreens said the value of its ill-fated VillageMD merger has fallen so much, it was forced to take a massive $6 billion writedown on its balance sheet. In the past few years, CVS has closed about 900 locations and Rite Aid, which entered bankruptcy in October, closed more than 100. \u2013CNN\u2019s Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/business/walgreens-closures/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_us_uvalde-grand-jury-indictments-police-chief-officer", "text": "A grand jury has indicted two former Uvalde school police officers in the botched law enforcement response to the 2022 mass shooting at Robb Elementary school that left 19 children and two teachers dead, two Texas state government sources with knowledge of the indictment told CNN Thursday. Former Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District Police Chief Pete Arredondo and former school police officer Adrian Gonzales were named in the indictments, which represent the first criminal charges filed in the school massacre. Arredondo surrendered himself to the custody of the Texas Rangers in Uvalde on Thursday, an official with the Texas Department of Public Safety told CNN. The former chief was booked on 10 counts of child endangerment and known criminal negligence, according an official at the Uvalde County Jail. Arredondo is currently in custody at the facility, the official said. The indictments against the two officers were not immediately available from the Uvalde County District Court clerk\u2019s office. Arredondo and Gonzales face felony charges of abandoning and endangering a child, Uvalde District Attorney Christina Mitchell told the Uvalde Leader-News. Family members of the victims have been meeting with the DA\u2019s office to discuss the results of the months-long grand jury investigation, according to Brett Cross, the guardian of 10-year-old Uziyah Garcia, one of the fourth graders killed in the shooting rampage. Earlier this year, the\u00a0US Justice Department\u00a0released a damning report that concluded law enforcement officers had\u00a0many opportunities to reassess their flawed response\u00a0to the May 24, 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary School. Bursts of gunfire, reports a teacher had been shot and then a desperate call from a student trapped with the gunman could \u2013 and should \u2013 all have prompted a drive to stop the bloodshed far sooner, said the report. Instead, it took 77 minutes from when the 18-year-old shooter walked into Robb Elementary School until he was stopped. The carnage remains among the\u00a0deadliest\u00a0episodes in America\u2019s\u00a0ongoing scourge\u00a0of campus shootings. Critical failures in leadership\u00a0among specific law enforcement officers who rushed to Robb Elementary are cited by the Justice Department, whose\u00a0575-page report\u00a0was released nearly 20 months after the massacre. Arredondo was fired\u00a0in August 2022 for his role in the failed response. In May, his replacement, Joshua Gutierrez, submitted his\u00a0resignation and his last day on the job was Wednesday, according to a school official\u2019s statement. Officers, school employees and shooting victims testified before grand jury Multiple law enforcement officers who responded to the shooting, including members of the Texas Department of Public Safety, were ordered to testify before the grand jury, CNN previously reported. School employees and victims of the shooting began their testimony before the grand jury in March \u2013 shortly after the Uvalde City Council\u00a0released an independent report clearing all local officers of wrongdoing. The independent investigator hired by the city\u00a0reported his findings at a packed city council meeting, saying all the officers who responded to the school from the Uvalde Police Department acted in good faith and should be exonerated. The findings sparked the fury of many victims\u2019 parents and community members who have\u00a0said for nearly two years that some should not be absolved. Less than a week after the release of the report, Uvalde Police Chief Daniel Rodriguez abruptly announced he would resign, effective April 6, saying it was time for \u201ca new chapter\u201d in his career. Federal report describes failed police response The Justice Department report dismissed the early official narrative of brave first responders saving lives that day and said \u201cmany victims shared that it added to their pain during a challenging time.\u201d The report found ample problems also emerged after the gunman was killed \u2013 from getting students away from the school and reunited with families to how bereaved parents were told their children were dead, the release of information about what happened, and the provision of therapy services. The report describes the quick arrival of law enforcement officers who ran toward the sound of gunfire, then almost immediately stopped once they got near the classrooms where the gunman was killing fourth graders and educators. That decision ran counter to\u00a0widely established active shooter response protocol, which instructs law enforcement to move toward and eliminate any threat. Instead, the intensity level dropped as responders began to treat the situation as a \u201cbarricaded suspect\u201d operation that did not need immediate action, even as more officers arrived and the signals of ongoing danger multiplied. That was the \u201csingle most critical tactical failure,\u201d the team from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services found. In May, 19 families of the students and teachers killed or injured in the mass shooting said they settled a lawsuit with the city for $2 million and announced they are suing 92 officers with Texas Department of Public Safety, the school district and individual employees. The city confirmed the settlement in a statement. \u201cIt has been an unbearable two years,\u201d Javier Cazares, the father of 9-year-old victim Jacklyn Cazares, said at a May news conference. \u201cWe all know who took our children\u2019s lives, but there was an obvious systemic failure out there on May 24.

{"id": "2024_06_26_us_nyc-public-schools-cell-phone-ban", "text": "Adding to a growing list of school districts banning cell phones, the nation\u2019s largest could be moving to do the same as early as January. Phone usage during the school day has not only become a distraction, but an addiction, David Banks, the chancellor of New York City Public Schools, said during an on-camera interview with WNYW. \u201cWe recognize the problem and that it is a major issue,\u201d Banks said. The chancellor said he expects a formal announcement to be made as soon as he\u00a0fine-tunes how to implement a plan that would impact more than 1 million students across nearly 2,000 public schools in the city. Wednesday is the last day of school for the system before the summer break. New York\u2019s decision comes on the heels of the Los Angeles Unified School District moving to ban cell phones in schools just last week. The moves from two of the country\u2019s largest school districts highlight a frustration shared by educators from coast to coast. In the United States, 72% of high school teachers said cell phone distraction is \u201ca major problem in the classroom,\u201d according to a report last week by the\u00a0Pew Research Center. \u201cIn about two weeks, you\u2019re going to hear a big announcement from us,\u201d Banks told CNN affiliate, NY1 on Wednesday, adding the change could go into effect as early as January 2025. \u201cWe\u2019re still looking at the logistics of how you would actually roll it out in a system this large,\u201d Banks told WNYW. \u201cWe\u2019ll have those kinks worked out in the next couple weeks.\u201d CNN reached out to the chancellor\u2019s office which deferred to his interviews, offering no further comment. Meanwhile, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is considering state-level action on the issue of smartphones in schools, according to a spokesperson. States including Oklahoma, Kansas, Vermont, Ohio, Louisiana and Pennsylvania have all introduced similar legislation. Hundreds of principals have told Banks to\u00a0\u201ctake\u00a0the phones,\u201d according to local interviews he\u2019s done with local media. Some parents, though, aren\u2019t sold on the idea. Banks has heard parents\u2019 concerns that a ban would prevent them from staying in touch with their children during an emergency, he said. \u201cWe want you to be able to bring your phone to school because the minute that school is over you need to be in communication with your family,\u201d Banks told NY1. \u201cWe can\u2019t control what happens once they\u2019re home,\u201d he said, \u201cbut maybe six to eight hours out of the day, we might have a little bit more control.\u201d Former New York Mayor\u00a0Bill de Blasio allowed phones back into schools in 2015 after they were barred by his City Hall predecessor Mike Bloomberg. Bloomberg penned\u00a0an op-ed\u00a0Tuesday headlined,\u00a0\u201cAdams must reinstate NYC schools\u2019 former cellphone ban \u2013 for our kids\u2019 sake.\u201d New York Mayor Eric Adams supports the move. \u201cThe distractions that come from cell phones is serious and we can\u2019t ignore that,\u201d Adams said during a news conference Tuesday. City Hall is looking for a \u201csweet spot\u201d to \u201cget parents in a comfortable place,\u201d he said. Adams did not respond to requests for further comment.

{"id": "2024_05_30_us_kohberger-idaho-killings-pretrial-hearings", "text": "After yet another pre-trial hearing in Bryan Kohberger\u2019s quadruple murder trial in early May, the family of one of the victims openly criticized the slow pace of the proceedings. \u201cThis case is turning into a hamster wheel of motions, hearings, and delayed decisions,\u201d the \u201cincredibly frustrated\u201d family of slain University of Idaho student Kaylee Goncalves said in a statement. The criticism stemmed from the long and winding road that\u2019s unfolded since four University of Idaho students \u2013 Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen \u2013 were fatally stabbed in the overnight hours of November 13, 2022, at a home just off the school\u2019s main campus in Moscow. Kohberger, a Washington State University graduate student in criminology, was arrested in the killings on December 30, 2022, in his home state of Pennsylvania. A\u00a0not guilty plea was entered on his behalf in May 2023, and his\u00a0attorneys have indicated the 29-year-old intends to present an alibi as part of his defense. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty. The trial is set to begin June 2, 2025, according to a scheduling order filed in court. Still, the progression of the case has been slowed by a series of pre-trial motions and hearings. Latah County Judge John Judge said in April he wants a \u201chearing at least every month,\u201d noting the importance of \u201ccleaning up\u201d the legal proceedings. The hearings largely fall into a few different buckets. One relates to the defense attorneys\u2019 access to evidence, particularly how the prosecution used investigative genetic genealogy in building the case. A second set of hearings concerns Kohberger\u2019s proposed alibi for his innocence. Third, there have be a number of hearings related to a gag order that restricts what the parties can publicly say about the case. Here\u2019s a timeline of some of the notable pre-trial hearings and decisions so far: June 9, 2023: A coalition of media organizations and the family of a murder victim came to court to challenge the gag order placed on the parties in the case. June 23, 2023: The judge denied both requests but issued a revised gag order that allows the parties to discuss topics that do not have a \u201csubstantial likelihood of materially prejudicing or otherwise influencing the outcome of the case.\u201d August 2, 2023: Kohberger\u2019s attorneys said they would\u00a0use an alibi defense but couldn\u2019t pin down their client\u2019s specific location on the night of the killings because he was \u201cdriving during the late night and early morning hours.\u201d \u201cMr.\u00a0Kohberger\u00a0is not claiming to be at a specific location at a specific time; at this time there is not a specific witness to say precisely where Mr.\u00a0Kohberger\u00a0was at each moment of the hours\u201d of the attacks, his attorneys said in a court filing. October 26, 2023: The judge denied a\u00a0request to dismiss the grand jury indictment after the defense argued there was an error in the grand jury instructions. December 18, 2023: The judge denied a second motion to dismiss the indictment after the defense argued prosecutors failed to comply fully with state rules on jury selection and the jury questionnaire. February 28, 2024: Defense attorney Anne C. Taylor asked the court to allow three defense experts and others to view the investigative genetic genealogy evidence, which has been sealed, to understand the full timeline of how police began to focus on Kohberger. Genetic genealogy is a practice that blends DNA analysis in the lab with genealogical research, such as tracing a person\u2019s family tree. In this case, investigators found a single source of male DNA on the button snap of a leather knife sheath left at the crime scene,\u00a0according to a probable cause affidavit. FBI investigators loaded the DNA profile to public genealogy sites to search for a match and then sent a tip to investigate Kohberger, according to a prosecution court filing. The judge initially declined to give the defense investigators extended access to the investigative genetic genealogy, saying he would rather the experts already approved to view the material give justification for digging deeper. April 4, 2024: The judge criticized Kohberger\u2019s defense attorney, saying she commissioned phone surveys to potential jurors that could hinder Kohberger\u2019s ability to get a fair trial. However, Taylor said the judge violated her client\u2019s right to due process by ordering a stop to the anonymous survey without hearing the defense\u2019s side first. April 17, 2024: Kohberger\u2019s defense lawyers filed a court document saying they plan\u00a0to offer a cell phone tower and radio frequency expert to partially corroborate\u00a0his proposed alibi that he was out driving west of Moscow\u00a0on the night of the slayings. April 19, 2024: The judge allowed surveys conducted with potential jurors to continue \u201cwithout modification\u201d after temporarily pausing them. April 29, 2024: The prosecution asked the court to deny Kohberger the opportunity to add to his alibi and to preclude anyone other than the defendant to testify as to his whereabouts on the night of the murders. May 2, 2024: Kohberger\u2019s defense had asked for an upcoming evidentiary hearing with witnesses be made public, while the prosecution asked that it be sealed. The judge ruled that it will be closed to the public. May 23, 2024: Taylor, the defense attorney, questioned a Moscow police detective about the preparation of visual cell phone logs and methods for searching for certain videos. The testimony was related to two motions to compel prosecutors to share discovery with the defense, but the contents of the motions are sealed, so it was not clear what they were requesting. May 30, 2024: The Moscow police detective leading the investigation and a defense expert in cell phone location data testified that the defense has not received some key evidence in the case. Cpl. Brett Payne, the lead investigator on the case, testified he and other investigators collected thousands of hours of video surveillance as they tried to locate a white Hyundai Elantra connected to the suspect. The videos are saved on various thumb drives, but there is no central inventory of the videos, he testified. He also said investigators did not see on any of the videos the Elantra going south from Moscow toward Pullman, Washington, in the early morning hours after the killings. The probable cause affidavit used in the case alleges Kohberger drove south toward Pullman after he committed the four killings. Sy Ray, an expert on cell phone geolocation data, testified that he has not been provided the underlying AT&T source data and list of nearby cell towers that was used by detectives to create a map of Kohberger\u2019s movements with his cell phone. Based on the data he had received, he believed some statements in the records were not accurate, and he said the missing data could be helpful to the defense. \u201cBecause of the piecemealing of the data, because of the missing data, because of data that I\u2019m reviewing that is incredibly inaccurate, everything that is missing is absolutely to the benefit of the defense right now,\u201d he said. June 7, 2024: After previously restricting who had access to the investigative genetic genealogy evidence, the judge ruled to allow unnamed \u201cdefense investigators\u201d to view the material. June 27, 2024: The parties agreed to go to trial around this time next year, with a scheduling order filed in court establishing the start date as June 2, 2025. Judge set aside about three months for the trial, including two weeks for jury selection, eight weeks for the trial and two weeks for potential post-conviction hearings and sentencing. \u201cThis is a great step to set these deadlines and hearings so that we can move through this,\u201d he said. The scheduling order also indicates any motions challenging the death penalty are to be filed by September 5, with responses due by October 10. If a motion to change the venue is granted, \u201cthe Court anticipates that the trial dates will not change,\u201d the ruling states.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/us/kohberger-idaho-killings-pretrial-hearings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_us_oklahoma-schools-bible-curriculum", "text": "All Oklahoma schools are required to incorporate the Bible and the Ten Commandments in their curriculums, effective immediately, the state\u2019s chief education officer announced in a memorandum Thursday. At a State Board of Education meeting, Oklahoma State Superintendent\u00a0of Public Instruction Ryan Walters said the Bible is \u201cone of the most foundational documents used for the Constitution and the birth of our country.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s crystal clear to us that in the Oklahoma academic standards under Title 70 on multiple occasions, the Bible is a necessary historical document to teach our kids about the history of this country, to have a complete understanding of Western civilization, to have an understanding of the basis of our legal system,\u201d Walters said. Every classroom in the state from grades 5 through 12 must have a Bible and all teachers must teach from the Bible in the classroom, Walters said. The Oklahoma memorandum follows a law in Louisiana passed\u00a0June 19,\u00a0that\u00a0requires\u00a0all public classrooms to display the Ten Commandments. A group of Louisiana parents and civil rights organizations are\u00a0suing\u00a0the state over the new law, contending the legislation violates both US Supreme Court precedent and the First Amendment. Oklahoma\u2019s directive \u201cis in alignment with the educational standards approved on or about May 2019, with which all districts must comply,\u201d according to a news release. \u201cThe Bible is an indispensable historical and cultural touchstone,\u201d Walters said in the release. \u201cWithout basic knowledge of it, Oklahoma students are unable to properly contextualize the foundation of our nation. This is not merely an educational directive but a crucial step in ensuring our students grasp the core values and historical context of our country.\u201d Interfaith Alliance, a national organization that seeks to protect religious freedoms, told CNN in a statement Thursday: \u201cThis is blatant religious coercion that should have absolutely no place in public schools \u2013 in Oklahoma or any other state.\u201d \u201cTrue religious freedom means ensuring that no one religious group is allowed to impose their viewpoint on all Americans. The vast majority of people of faith in this country reject these dangerous, intimidating efforts to force a Christian nationalist agenda into our schools, our courts and our government,\u201d the statement said. The new memo comes after the Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked an effort to establish the first publicly funded religious charter school in the country. The court on Tuesday ordered the state to rescind its contract with\u00a0St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School\u00a0in a 6-2 decision with one recusal. \u201cUnder Oklahoma law, a charter school is a public school,\u201d wrote Justice James R. Winchester for the court. \u201cAs such, a charter school must be nonsectarian. However, St. Isidore will evangelize the Catholic faith as part of its school curriculum while sponsored by the State.\u201d Walters called the ruling \u201cone of the worst\u201d decisions the state Supreme Court has made and pledged to \u201cfight back.\u201d \u201cWhat the court did was rule against the parents of Oklahoma who have demanded more choices for their kids. We have a great opportunity to make sure that parents have the most options of any parents in the country here in Oklahoma, by giving them the ability to go to a public school, charter schools, private schools, this would have been the most unique charter school in the country,\u201d Walters said. \u201cSo I want you all to know, we will continue to fight back against this, we want to continue to provide an opportunity for parents to send their kids to high-quality schools.\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union applauded the decision, saying, \u201cCharter schools are public schools that must be secular and serve all students. St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, which plans to discriminate against students, families, and staff and indoctrinate students into one religion, cannot operate as a public charter school.\u201d This is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/us/oklahoma-schools-bible-curriculum/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_us_trails-carolina-camp-death-update-homicide", "text": "A boy from New York journeyed to North Carolina for camp but did not survive his first night, authorities said.\u00a0Now, his death is being investigated as a homicide. Hours after arriving at Trails Carolina, a program for adolescents with behavioral or emotional issues, the 12-year-old suffocated in February after camp staff directed him to sleep in a fully enclosed bivy sack, a newly released autopsy report states. A bivy sack is a piece of sleeping equipment that usually includes waterproof material. \u201cThe cause of death is asphyxia due to smothering,\u201d the autopsy report says. \u201cThe manner of death is homicide.\u201d The boy\u2019s family, who lives in New York, has asked CNN not to publicize the boy\u2019s name. The family declined to comment further, family representative Robert J. Higdon Jr. said. The Transylvania County Sheriff\u2019s Office said it is investigating the death. While no arrests have been made, investigators do have suspects, Det. John C. Nicholson told CNN on Wednesday. The sheriff\u2019s detective declined to answer additional questions, citing the ongoing investigation. CNN has reached out to Trails Carolina for comment. While North Carolina authorities have started the process to permanently revoke the nature camp\u2019s license, Trails Carolina could still appeal. Confined in a bivy enclosed with an alarm A bivy sack gives more protection than a sleeping bag alone, often eliminating the need to sleep in a tent when camping. Bivies typically include a breathable inner layer that can be zipped and an opaque, waterproof outer layer. \u201cIt should be noted that a common warning on commercially available bivy products indicates that the outer, weather resistant opening should not be fully secured as it may lead to condensation and breathing restriction,\u201d the boy\u2019s autopsy report states. \u201cThis information was obtained on basic web search.\u201d During the overnight hours between February 2 and 3, the boy was directed to sleep in a fully enclosed bivy with an attached alarm that would alert counselors if the boy tried to leave, the autopsy report states. The child had previously left his bivy sack to sleep outside of it. The counselors woke him and made him re-enter the bivy. According to the camp\u2019s protocol, the boy \u201cwas placed to sleep in a bivy (small camping enclosure) with a sleeping mat and sleeping bag,\u201d the autopsy report states. \u201cThe program\u2019s protocol required the bivy to be placed on top of a thick mil plastic sheet which was folded up the sides in the form of a \u2018canoe\u2019. The opening to the bivy was then secured with an alarm device such that if the occupant attempted to exit the bivy, it would alarm and wake up the counselors in the cabin,\u201d the autopsy report says. \u201cAccording to investigative reports, the internal mesh bivy door, which is normally used to secure the opening, was torn and the outer weather resistant door was instead (used) to secure the opening with the alarm device.\u201d During the overnight hours, a counselor noticed the boy was moving around \u201cbut stopped moving shortly after,\u201d the autopsy report states. \u201cRoutine checks were performed throughout the night, but due to the outer, opaque layer of the bivy being closed, he could not be visualized,\u201d the report says. \u201cIn the morning, the counselors attempted to wake him up but noted he was not moving.\u201d Trails Carolina released multiple statements in the days following the boy\u2019s death. \u201cWe are shattered by the tragic loss of a young life and our deepest sympathies are with the student\u2019s family and loved ones,\u201d the camp said in a February 6 statement. Two days later, the camp issued another statement in response to the sheriff\u2019s office\u2019s initial findings, which said the boy\u2019s death \u201cappeared suspicious\u201d and claimed the camp was not cooperating with the investigation. \u201cTrails has conducted an internal investigation of this incident and the Trails facility has been investigated by outside professionals who are subject-matter experts,\u201d the camp said February 8. \u201cBoth investigations have concluded that there is no evidence that Trails failed to properly supervise, no evidence that Trails caused harm, and no evidence that conditions at Trails were unsafe or unhealthy.\u201d \u201cOur staff have fully cooperated with the local law enforcement\u2019s investigation,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cAny assertion to the contrary is false, reckless, and defamatory.\u201d Trails Carolina has not given an updated statement to CNN after repeated requests for comment this week. The camp is shut down for now Trails Carolina is an \u201coutcome-driven nature-based therapy program in Lake Toxaway, North Carolina,\u201d the camp said in its February 6 statement. \u201cThe program helps adolescents, aged 10-17-years-old, work through behavioral or emotional difficulties, build trusting relationships with their family and peers, and achieve academic success.\u201d The camp \u201cpairs psychological counseling with a variety of outdoor activities, including hiking, backpacking, camping, rock climbing and equine-assisted emotional work,\u201d Trails Carolina said. Following the boy\u2019s death and an investigation into the camp, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services started the process of revoking Trails Carolina\u2019s license, according to documents obtained by CNN. \u201cThey cannot operate at this time,\u201d agency spokesperson Kelly Haight Connor said Tuesday. On February 12, the DHHS sent a letter to Trails Carolina ordering the camp to halt new admissions and stop using \u201cbivy bags for any purpose\u201d until an investigation is complete. On March 28, the DHHS sent a letter ordering Trails Carolina to suspend admissions because \u201cconditions in the facility are found to be detrimental to the health and safety of the clients.\u201d The letter cited violations involving medication requirements, incident response requirements and protection from harm, abuse, neglect or exploitation. And on May 17, the DHHS sent a letter to Trails Carolina saying it was starting the process to revoke its license. But Trails Carolina has 60 days \u2013 or until mid-July \u2013 to appeal the revocation of its license. As of Tuesday, the DHHS was not aware of any appeals filed, the agency\u2019s spokesperson said. CNN\u2019s Eva Roytburg contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_06_27_business_boeing-cause-alaska-air-door-plug", "text": "For months, missing paperwork has hindered the investigation into how a door plug blew off a 737 Max on an Alaska Airlines flight in January, making it difficult to find out who made the near tragic mistake. This week, Boeing disclosed that the paperwork may have caused the problem in the first place. It was already well known that no documentation was found to show who worked on the door plug, which came off the plane after it had reached around 16,000 feet in the air causing an uncontrolled decompression, which injured a few passengers and even tore one\u2019s shirt off. But at a briefing for journalists at Boeing\u2019s 737 Max factory in Renton, Washington, Boeing said that the lack of paperwork is why the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place were never installed before the plane left the factory in October. The workers who needed to reinstall the bolts never had the work order telling them the work needed to be done. Without the bolts, the door plug incident was pretty much inevitable. Luckily, it wasn\u2019t fatal. It\u2019s a sign of the problems with the quality of work along the Boeing assembly lines. Those problems have become the focus of multiple federal investigations and whistleblower revelations, and the cause of delays in jet deliveries that are causing headaches for airlines and passengers around the globe. Boeing may have stepped in it\u2026 again But Boeing may have landed itself in even more trouble with regulators for divulging the details at this stage. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reprimanded Boeing Thursday for releasing \u201cnon-public investigative information\u201d to the media. It said in a statement that the company had \u201cblatantly violated\u201d the agency\u2019s rules. \u201cDuring a media briefing Tuesday about quality improvements\u2026 a Boeing executive provided investigative information and gave an analysis of factual information previously released. Both of these actions are prohibited,\u201d the NTSB said. Boeing will no longer have access to information generated by the NTSB during its investigation, the agency said, adding it was referring Boeing\u2019s conduct to the Department of Justice. \u201cAs a party to many NTSB investigations over the past decades, few entities know the rules better than Boeing,\u201d the NTSB said. In a letter sent to Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun Thursday, NTSB Office of Aviation Safety Director Timothy LeBaron said this week\u2019s media briefing was done without the consent or knowledge of the regulator. \u201cBoeing must take all reasonable steps to ensure that investigative information is protected from public release,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSuch a release or withholding of critical information from our investigators are blatant violations of NTSB\u2019s regulations.\u201d Boeing responded that it held the briefing in an effort to \u201ctake responsibility\u201d and be transparent for its role in the incident. It said it \u201cshared context on the lessons we have learned from the\u00a0January 5\u00a0accident.\u201d \u201cWe deeply regret that some of our comments, intended to make clear our responsibility in the accident and explain the actions we are taking, overstepped the NTSB\u2019s role as the source of investigative information,\u201d said Boeing\u2019s statement. \u201cWe apologize to the NTSB and stand ready to answer any questions as the agency continues its investigation.\u201d The NTSB also chastised Boeing for stating earlier this month that a rare, unsafe back-and-forth roll during a Southwest 737 Max flight in May was not because of a design or manufacturing error. The NTSB, which is investigating that incident, told Calhoun Thursday it had not made a determination yet and Boeing and the NTSB must speak with one voice when making public statements. Bad paperwork trail Boeing said during the Tuesday briefing that the reason the Alaska Air door plug was not probably secured in the first place was because two different groups of employees at the plant were charged with doing the work, with one removing and the other reinstalling the door plug as the plane was passing along the assembly line. The first group of employees removed the door plug to address problems with some rivets that were made by a supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. But they didn\u2019t generate the paperwork indicating they had removed the door plug, along with\u00a0the four bolts necessary to hold it in place, in order to do that work. When a different group of employees put the plug back in place, Boeing says the employees didn\u2019t think the plane would actually fly in that condition. Instead, they were just blocking the hole with the plug to protect the inside of the fuselage from weather as the plane moved outside to a different area of the factory compound. That group of employees often makes those kind of temporary fixes. \u201cThe doors team closes up the aircraft before it is moved outside, but it\u2019s not their responsibility to install the pins,\u201d said Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president of quality for Boeing\u2019s commercial airplane unit. Those employees likely assumed paperwork existed showing that the plug and bolts had been removed, and that paperwork would prompt someone else along the line to install the bolts. But without the paperwork, no one on the assembly line knew that the door plug had ever been removed, or that its bolts were missing, Lund said. Removing a door plug after a plane arrives from Spirit AeroSystems rarely happens, Lund added, so no one was aware the door plug needed attention. \u201c(Permanent) reinstallation is done by another team based on the paperwork showing what jobs are unfinished,\u201d Lund said. \u201cBut there was no paperwork, so nobody knew to follow up.\u201d An accident waiting to happen The plane actually flew for about two months with the door plug in place despite the lack of bolts. But minutes after the Alaska Airlines flight took off from Portland, Oregon, on January 5, the door plug blew out, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Passengers\u2019 clothing and phones were ripped away from them and sent hurtling into the night sky. But fortunately no passengers were seriously injured, and the crew was able to land the plane safely. The missing bolts had been identified in preliminary findings of the National Transportation Safety Board, but that report did not assess blame for the accident. And a final report is not expected for about a year or more. A spokesperson for the NTSB said that the safety agency is continuing its investigation and will not comment on Boeing\u2019s explanation for how the mistake was made. The board released a preliminary report in February that said it had found the bolts were missing when it left the Boeing factory, but it did not assess blame. A final report is not expected for a year or more. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy has testified about the missing paperwork at Congressional hearings since the preliminary report was released. Boeing is addressing the problem by slowing down its assembly lines, and making sure that planes don\u2019t advance with problems under the assumption that those problems will be dealt with later in the assembly process, Lund said. \u201cWe have slowed down our factories to make sure this is under control,\u201d she said. \u201cI am extremely confident that the actions that we took,\u201d will ensure every airplane leaving this factory is safe, she added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/business/boeing-cause-alaska-air-door-plug/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_us_karen-read-murder-trial-closings", "text": "Is Karen Read a rage-filled cop killer, or the convenient patsy of a vast police cover-up? That\u2019s the question put to a Massachusetts jury on Tuesday in closing arguments of her murder trial in a case that has riveted the Bay State. The case stems from the death of Boston Police Officer John O\u2019Keefe, whose body was found bruised and battered in the snow on January 29, 2022, outside the home of a fellow Boston police officer in the suburb of Canton. Prosecutors have alleged Read and O\u2019Keefe, who were dating, had gotten into an argument that night, and that she drunkenly drove a vehicle into him and fled the scene, leaving him to die in the cold. \u201cWhat the constellation of the facts and the evidence ineluctably demonstrate here is that the defendant drove her vehicle in reverse at 24.2 miles per hour for 62.5 feet, struck Mr. O\u2019Keefe, causing those catastrophic head injuries, leaving him incapacitated and freezing him to death,\u201d prosecutor Adam Lally said in closing arguments Tuesday. In contrast, her defense has accused off-duty police inside that Canton home of fatally beating O\u2019Keefe, dumping his body on the lawn and then conspiring through fabricated evidence and false testimony to frame Read. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, there was a cover-up in this case, plain and simple,\u201d defense attorney Alan Jackson said. \u201cYou\u2019ll surely say to yourself, \u2018I don\u2019t want to believe it, I don\u2019t want to believe that could happen in our community,\u2019 but sadly over these past eight weeks you\u2019ve seen it right before your eyes.\u201d Read, 45, has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene of a collision. After closing arguments Tuesday morning, the jury began deliberations at about 1:30 p.m. and continued for about three hours. They will return on Wednesday morning. The closing arguments represent the end of a murder trial that has garnered interest both local and widespread, including accusations of witness tampering, a federal probe into the investigation, and groups of pink-wearing supporters chanting to \u201cFree Karen Read.\u201d The prosecution\u2019s case also has been hampered by a series of missteps and unusual investigative practices. Most notably, a lead investigator in the case, Massachusetts State Police Trooper Michael Proctor, admitted that he sent a series of sexist and offensive texts about Read in a private group chat, calling her a \u201cwhack job,\u201d mocking her medical issues and commenting to coworkers that he had found \u201cno nudes\u201d while searching her phone for evidence, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Proctor apologized for the \u201cunprofessional\u201d comments on the stand, but the vulgar texts have been sharply criticized in and out of court, including from the governor. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unprofessional,\u201d Gov. Maura Healey told WCVB of the texts. \u201cIt does harm, frankly, to the dignity and the integrity of the work of men and women across the state police and law enforcement. So as a former attorney general and as governor, I am disgusted by that.\u201d At closing arguments, the prosecution condemned the texts as \u201cunprofessional, indefensible, (and) inexcusable\u201d but said they had no impact on the integrity of the investigation. The defense disagreed. \u201cThey cannot distance themselves from the stench of him on this case and this investigation. Those secret group chats illustrate the quality and care of this investigation,\u201d Jackson said. How the trial has gone The heart of the trial stems from what happened on one wintry evening in Canton over two years ago. On the night of January 28, 2022, Read and O\u2019Keefe went out drinking at two bars with friends. Shortly after midnight, the couple climbed into Read\u2019s SUV and drove to the home of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s colleague on Fairview Road for an after-party, court documents show. The prosecution alleged that the couple got into an argument that led to O\u2019Keefe getting out of the vehicle. A drunken Read then struck him with the vehicle and fled, leaving him to die in the snowy cold, prosecutors say. However, Read has said she dropped off O\u2019Keefe at the house and then drove to his home because she wasn\u2019t feeling well, according to court documents. The next morning, when she realized he was still not home, she drove in a snowstorm to look for him, and finally found his body in the front yard of the Canton house. Read and her legal team have alleged O\u2019Keefe was injured in a fight inside the house \u2013 including being mauled by the homeowners\u2019 German shepherd, Chloe \u2013 and then tossed out in the snow. They argued that Read was framed for his death and alleged a vast cop conspiracy and a corrupt investigation. Prosecutors have rejected that theory. Firefighters who responded to the scene that morning asked about his injuries, and Read told them, \u201cI hit him, I hit him,\u201d according to their testimony. In addition, Read\u2019s vehicle had a broken taillight, and pieces of the taillight were found outside the Canton home, prosecutors said. \u201cFrom all of those people within that house that evening, none of them at any point in time observed John O\u2019Keefe come into that house,\u201d Lally said in opening statements. \u201cThey saw the vehicle pull away and they just assumed that they (O\u2019Keefe and Read) left and that no one was coming.\u201d The trial began in April and featured testimony from several law enforcement officers, with some as witnesses and others as investigators. The prosecution has presented evidence that Read and O\u2019Keefe had a volatile relationship. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s niece and nephew said they heard the couple yelling in arguments prior to his death, and an ATF agent testified about his romantic kiss and text messages with Read, according to WCVB. Further, in the minutes after prosecutors say she hit him with the SUV, she called his phone and left a voicemail yelling, \u201cJohn, I f**king hate you!\u201d The defense has sharply questioned witnesses about whether Read truly confessed to hitting him with her vehicle and have challenged investigators about the quality of their work. For example, investigators used red plastic cups to collect evidence from the scene, and surveillance video of Read\u2019s vehicle was inexplicably flipped to a mirror image, WCVB reported. \u201cLie, obfuscate, manipulate, alter, and when they\u2019re caught, they just excuse it away,\u201d Jackson said in closing arguments. \u201cThat\u2019s not sloppiness,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s evidence manipulation.\u201d Aidan Kearney, a Massachusetts blogger nicknamed Turtleboy, has fed the ongoing debate with numerous posts alleging a murder coverup by law enforcement and local politicians. In October, Kearney pleaded not guilty to charges of\u00a0witness intimidation and conspiracy, CNN affiliate WBZ reported, after he allegedly called and sent messages to witnesses and investigators in Read\u2019s case.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/us/karen-read-murder-trial-closings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "us"}}

The system provides lightning warnings by monitoring cloud and cloud-to-ground lightning\u00a0strikes\u00a0within a radius set by the user of up to 20 miles,\u00a0according to the\u00a0company\u2019s website. Kroon said the installation, which had been in preparation for months, was scheduled to take place Wednesday. Kroon emphasized that the installation was not in response to the tragedy on Sunday. \u201cThe Borough made that investment because public safety is extremely important and we want to do everything we can to alert our residents and visitors to imminent danger,\u201d Kroon said. According to the\u00a0National Lightning Safety Council, this is the third lightning death in the United States this year, and the first death in New Jersey since 2021 when a lifeguard was struck and killed on a beach in South Seaside Park. Since 2006, New Jersey has had 16 lightning deaths, five were on beaches. Fussell told WABC that Dispoto never passed up an opportunity to make someone\u2019s life easier and that\u2019s what she wants people to know. \u201cSo, his last act of heroism was his ultimate, and that\u2019s my Patrick Dispoto,\u201d Fussell said.

The Defense Department IG will look specifically at the \u201ceffectiveness of DoD\u2019s efforts to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza through the maritime corridor,\u201d a\u00a0press release\u00a0on Thursday, announcing the effort, said. The USAID IG will look at the agency\u2019s \u201cplans and controls\u201d over the distribution of aid from the pier, and particularly the handoff of aid from the pier to the World Food Programme. The pier \u2014\u00a0called the Joint Logistics Over The Shore, or JLOTS \u2014 was first established on the Gaza coast in May. It has had to be re-anchored twice: once after it broke apart in heavy seas, a week after it was anchored for the first time, and again when it was disconnected intentionally in anticipation of more heavy seas. The review comes as some congressional Republicans have railed against the troubled pier as a \u201cwaste of taxpayer dollars\u201d that \u201cdefies all logic.\u201d On Wednesday, Rep. Mike Rogers, chair of the House Armed Services Committee, sent a letter to senior administration officials in which he said \u201cthe operation has been riddled with setbacks, sidelined more often than operational, and can only be classified as a gross waste of taxpayer dollars.\u201d Earlier this month, Sen. Roger Wicker, ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee was even more blunt. \u201cThis needs to end immediately,\u201d he said in a statement. WFP has had their distribution of aid from the pier paused for more than two weeks as they assess the security situation on the ground. CNN reported this week that there are more than 6,000 pallets of aid that have been delivered across the pier to the shore, awaiting distribution. Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Gaza has only grown more dire as the war between Israel and Hamas continues. A report this week from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) warned that the situation in Gaza \u201cremains catastrophic\u201d and that there is a \u201chigh and sustained risk of famine.\u201d \u201cThe last few months have demonstrated that food and humanitarian access and malnutrition prevalence can change very quickly, the risk of epidemics is increasing and eight months of extreme pressure on the lives of the population make them much more vulnerable to collapse into famine,\u201d the report said. US officials have said repeatedly that the pier is a temporary measure to get more aid to the desperate population of Gaza, and is not meant to replace land crossings which are critical to flow aid in. \u201cThe agreements between the DoD and USAID establish roles and responsibilities that help enable U.S. humanitarian assistance to reach Gaza through the maritime corridor,\u201d DoD Inspector General Robert P. Storch said in Thursday\u2019s release. \u201cGiven this, the DoD OIG and USAID OIG are working together to address the challenges associated with this mission. Through our collaboration, we will leverage the unique expertise, resources, and capabilities of our teams to optimize our oversight in this important area.\u201d USAID Inspector General Paul K. Martin said in the release that Congress \u201cand the American people can rely on USAID OIG to conduct independent and aggressive oversight of USAID-funded humanitarian assistance programming in Gaza.\u201d \u201cThis initial review, in coordination with DoD OIG, will provide timely insight and transparency over the delivery of assistance via the maritime corridor,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/pentagon-usaid-temporary-gaza-pier-oversight-reviews/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_us_alameda-county-death-penalty-prosecutors-criminal-conduct", "text": "The Alameda County District Attorney\u2019s office said it has uncovered possible criminal conduct committed by prosecutors after it was ordered to review dozens of death penalty cases to determine whether prosecutors intentionally excluded Black and Jewish jurors. Earlier this year, a federal judge ordered the district attorney\u2019s office to comb through each of the county\u2019s 35 death penalty cases after evidence revealed prosecutors had deliberately prevented Black and Jewish jurors from serving on a 19\ufeff95 capital murder trial. Investigators have since identified a \u201cserious pattern of misconduct\u201d involving multiple cases, Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price said Tuesday. She declined to provide an exact number of cases, citing the ongoing review. Her office believes some of the behavior \u201cin addition to violating the Constitution\u00a0may have been criminal,\u201d Price revealed during a news conference at her office in Oakland. The alleged misconduct was discovered by an Alameda County deputy district attorney while preparing for the appeal of death row inmate Ernest Dykes, who was convicted in the 1993 murder of 9-year-old Lance Clark. CNN last week published images of notes believed to be written by prosecutors during Dykes\u2019s trial, which included comments singling out potential jurors who were Black or Jewish. One potential juror in the Dykes case file is described as a \u201cShort, fat troll.\u201d Like other Black potential jurors \u2013 and only Black potential jurors \u2013 her race is noted. The letters \u201cFB\u201d are written next to her name, apparently noting her gender and race. Another juror has the word \u201cJewish\u201d underlined on their questionnaire. Farther down, a handwritten note reads: \u201cI liked him better than any other Jew. But no way.\u201d Ultimately, no Black or Jewish jurors were seated at the trial. Now, Clark\u2019s family says prosecutors told them\u00a0Dykes\u202fcould\u202fbe released from prison after they uncovered evidence of jury tampering in his case. The district attorney\u2019s office declined to comment. The death penalty cases under review date from the mid-1980s through 2007. Among those cases are convicted mass shooters, serial killers, rapists and murderers. Brian Pomerantz, an attorney for Dykes and other capital cases, says he believes the some of those serving death sentences might now be freed. \u201cFor some, that may be the solution,\u201d he said. \u201dAnd for some that should be the solution.\u201d Families of victims in the 35 cases must now confront the reality that the people convicted could be released, resentenced or face a new trial. Price said her office is engaged in settlement negotiations with the prisoners\u2019 lawyers and the state attorney general\u2019s office. The full review of cases will likely last through the end of the year, Price said. Price faces a recall election in November and members of the Alameda County prosecutors\u2019 union voted \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d to support the recall, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, citing an email sent from the union to its members on Monday. It is unclear how many prosecutors in the district attorney\u2019s office are represented by the union, nor what percentage of members supported the recall. When asked about the vote during Tuesday\u2019s news conference, the district attorney said she believes the union\u2019s actions are motivated by her office\u2019s probe into prosecutorial misconduct. \u201cThe whole world is watching and horrified by what we have uncovered as prosecutorial misconduct in this office, and our efforts to hold prosecutors accountable for this kind of misconduct and other ethical lapses has been met with resistance from the prosecutors union before we arrived,\u201d Price said. CNN has sought comment from the prosecutor\u2019s union on the vote.

{"id": "2024_06_26_economy_fed-stress-test-results", "text": "America\u2019s biggest banks are well positioned to survive a severe recession while continuing to lend to households and businesses, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday in its annual bank resilience test, commonly referred to as a stress test. However, banks could suffer higher losses, if a significant economic downturn were to hit now versus a year ago. As a result of the banking crisis that fueled the Great Recession, the Fed conducts stress tests to monitor and uncover potential signs of weaknesses in the financial system. The tests have taken on an extra layer of importance after the collapse of three US banks sent shockwaves through the banking system last year. The 31 banks required to take the test would lose $685 billion. That\u2019s an increase of $144 billion compared to last year\u2019s stress test results. However, fewer banks were tested last year. Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr attributed the higher collective losses to the fact that banks have taken on more risk while incurring higher expenses. The higher interest rate environment we\u2019re currently in has made it riskier, and more costly, for banks to make loans, which can depress their profitability. One area that weighed on banks more compared to last year is credit card debt, which recently hit a record high. Additionally, a higher percentage of people are making late payments. Both resulted in higher projected credit card losses. At the same time, banks\u2019 income from fees was lower, giving them less of a buffer to absorb those losses. \u201cThe goal of our test is to help to ensure that banks have enough capital to absorb losses in a highly stressful scenario. This test shows that they do,\u201d Barr said. How individual banks fared While all banks passed the tests, their performance varied significantly under the severe recession scenario. After the Fed\u2019s stress test results were released, JPMorgan Chase disclosed late Wednesday that its losses would likely be \u201cmodestly higher\u201d than the Fed had estimated. However, the nation\u2019s largest bank declined to specify how much higher the losses would be, when CNN inquired. Overall, the bank performed well in the stress test with an expected loan loss rate of 6.3%, which is below the 7.1% average across all 31 banks. Discover Financial Services suffered the biggest loan loss rate of 18.7%, followed by Capital One\u2019s 16.5% loan loss rate. Earlier this year, Capital One (COF) announced plans to acquire Discover (DFS). The acquisition hasn\u2019t been finalized and is subject to approval by the Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which are set to hold a joint meeting about the proposed acquisition next month. Discover\u2019s and Capital One\u2019s performance in the stress tests will likely cause regulators to scrutinize their financials even more closely, at a minimum. Shares of both companies were down by over 2% Thursday morning. In contrast, Charles Schwab (SCHW) suffered the smallest loan loss rate of 1.3%. Its stock moved slightly higher after the stress test results.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/economy/fed-stress-test-results/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_27_politics_aileen-cannon-trump-mar-a-lago-search-warrant-hearing", "text": "Judge Aileen Cannon wants to hold additional hearings on Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to challenge key evidence in his classified documents case and will allow the former president\u2019s lawyers to question witnesses about the investigation and search of Mar-a-Lago. On Thursday, the Florida-based judge said in a new order that she wants more evidence about the language in the FBI\u00a0warrant used to seize classified records from Mar-a-Lago in 2022 and about grand jury testimony from Trump\u2019s former attorney, Evan Corcoran. Those issues were argued in hearings on Tuesday, but Cannon did not rule on the matters. The judge did not say when additional hearings would be held. Cannon has been widely criticized for dragging out the case over multiple hearings, and a prosecutor\u00a0at the hearing earlier this week told her he believed the Trump team was\u00a0trying to hijack\u00a0the\u00a0proceedings\u00a0as a way to spread conspiracies about the work of federal investigators on this case. In her 11-page order Thursday, Cannon\u00a0seemed to push back on her critics. \u201cThere is a difference between a resource-wasting and delay-producing \u2018mini-trial,\u2019 on the one hand, and an evidentiary hearing geared to adjudicating the contested factual and legal issues on a given pre-trial motion to suppress,\u201d Cannon wrote. Cannon said she would revisit\u00a0the language used in the search warrant to seize property from Mar-a-Lago two years ago and\u00a0the Justice Department\u2019s use of Corcoran\u2019s testimony\u00a0to bolster\u00a0the obstruction part of the case. The special counsel\u2019s office has strongly opposed the need for additional hearings\u00a0and Trump\u2019s attempts to cut out parts of the case. Those court proceedings, which would include witness testimony and evidence presentation, would happen before a trial. Cannon then would need to decide if evidence seized from Trump\u2019s\u00a0Florida estate\u00a0and Corcoran\u2019s grand jury testimony could be used at trial. Cannon has not set dates for the additional hearings yet. In her order, she laid out the next steps before more hearings can happen. \u201cThe parties can meaningfully confer beforehand on the scope and timing of the hearing, raising appropriate objections with the Court as necessary; the parties can (and will) file exhibit and witness lists as is customary in federal criminal suppression litigation; and the Special Counsel can request the Court to impose reasonable limitations on the evidence produced to ensure efficiency and control,\u201d the judge said. Trump\u2019s lawyers say they believe the wording used in the search warrant to authorize agents to seize \u201cnational defense information\u201d and \u201cPresidential Records\u201d wasn\u2019t specific enough, and Cannon agreed that there were \u201cambiguities.\u201d \u201cThe Court determines that some of the terms in that document do not carry \u2018generally understood meaning[s]\u2019 such that a law enforcement agent, without further clarification, would have known to identify such material as \u2018seizable\u2019 property,\u201d the judge wrote on Thursday. \u201cFurther factual development is warranted related to Defendant Trump\u2019s particularity challenge\u201d of the search warrant\u2019s language.\u201d Cannon denied Trump\u2019s request, however, for another hearing about\u00a0the validity of the court-approved warrant\u00a0to search several rooms at Mar-a-Lago. Trump\u2019s team is also testing a Washington, DC,\u00a0federal court\u2019s decision during the grand jury investigation to force Corcoran to share his conversations with Trump,\u00a0after finding\u00a0Trump\u00a0may have\u00a0misled his attorney while attempting to obstruct federal authorities from recovering classified records after his presidency. Cannon said she would look again at the use of Corcoran\u2019s notes and testimony about his former client. \u201cIt is the obligation of this Court to make factual findings afresh on the crime-fraud issue,\u201d Cannon wrote. \u201cAnd a standard means by which to make such findings\u00a0\u2014\u00a0as is customary in criminal suppression litigation\u00a0\u2014\u00a0is following an evidentiary hearing at which both sides can present evidence (documentary and testimonial, as applicable).\u201d In an order Thursday, Cannon also said she would allow one more filing from each party on the proposed gag order from the special counsel\u2019s office. During a hearing over the gag order Monday, Cannon told prosecutors there needed \u201cto be a factual connection between A and B,\u201d referring to the gap between Trump\u2019s comments and potential threats prosecutors have warned about. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement that the case should be thrown out. \u201cHighly respected Judge Aileen Cannon has rightfully scheduled hearings on the un-Constitutional piercing of President Trump\u2019s attorney-client privilege and the illegal raid on Mar-a-Lago by Crooked Joe Biden\u2019s DOJ,\u201d Cheung said. \u201cThe entire documents case was a political sham from the very beginning and it should be thrown out entirely.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

Two undocumented men from Venezuela are accused of killing the girl and both are facing charges of capital murder in her death, according to the Houston Police Department. Both are being held on a $10 million bond this week, court records show. As Jocelyn\u2019s family laid her to rest Thursday, remembering her as a kind, good-hearted child who was her mother\u2019s best friend, Mayor John Whitmire called for justice, reminding attendees that children \u201care not supposed to be taken off the streets of Houston.\u201d This is also the latest case to bring immigration to the forefront as a critical issue this election year, as the two men were in the country illegally, according to the US Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Here\u2019s what we know so far about the cases around Jocelyn\u2019s death: Who was Jocelyn? Born on December 27, 2011, Jocelyn\u2019s family called her a \u201cloyal, compassionate and caring friend\u201d who supported those around her, her obituary says. Her kindness and \u201czest for life\u201d are among the things her family wants people to remember her for. At her celebration of life service, Jocelyn\u2019s sister Gabby remembered how the two of them would laugh, play, cry and \u201cget on each other\u2019s nerves.\u201d She described her older sister as smart and having a good heart. \u201cJossy also gave me courage to be myself and speak up for myself and for that I will always be grateful to you. I love you, Jossy,\u201d Gabby said. Jocelyn loved animals and wanted them all to have homes, not understanding why some were strays. Green was her favorite color. Jocelyn enjoyed fantasy, whether it was the magic of Harry Potter, vampire-film classic \u201cTwilight\u201d or the upside down of TV\u2019s \u201cStranger Things,\u201d her obituary reads. She even had a crush on \u201cStranger Things\u201d star Finn Wolfhard. She is survived by her mother, Alexis, brother, and \u201csister\u201d Gabby, as well as her grandparents and numerous family members. What happened to Jocelyn? Surveillance footage of the area obtained by detectives showed the suspects at a restaurant together the evening of June 16, Lt. Stephen Hope of the Houston Police Department said at a news conference after their arrests. The men left on foot and were later seen meeting and talking with Jocelyn, Hope said, before all three walked to a convenience store. A few minutes later, Hope said, they went to a bridge. Prosecutors allege the men killed Jocelyn and threw her body in the bayou. Jocelyn\u2019s body was found along West Rankin Road in a shallow creek in north Houston early in the morning of June 17, authorities have said. The 12-year-old was strangled to death, according to the medical examiner, the Associated Press reported. What we know about the accused men Johan Jose Martinez-Rangel, 22, and\u00a0Franklin Jose Pe\u00f1a Ramos, 26, were arrested June 20, three days after Jocelyn\u2019s strangled body was found in the creek, according to the Houston Police Department. Both men are from Venezuela and entered the US illegally, a spokesperson for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement told CNN. Where and when they entered the country is unclear, the spokesperson said, but each had been apprehended near El Paso by US Border Patrol \u2013\u00a0Martinez-Rangel on\u00a0March\u00a014\u00a0and Pe\u00f1a Ramos on May\u00a028\u00a0\u2013 and released with a notice to appear in court in the future. An attorney for Pe\u00f1a Ramos declined to comment. An attorney for Martinez-Rangel did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Where are the suspects now? Both men are under immigration holds by federal authorities, according to the AP, which means they could not leave custody even if they could post bond. Family and community reaction After her daughter\u2019s body was found, Alexis Nungaray cried as she realized the heartbreaking news she would have to share with her family. \u201cI\u2019m, like, angry that they took advantage of her. She was so young. She was 12. You took my baby away, you took her away,\u201d the mother told CNN affiliate KHOU on June 19. \u201cNow, I get to let her little brother know his older sister is never coming home.\u201d At a news conference on June 24, Nungaray shared her frustration that her daughter\u2019s life was taken from her. \u201cShe had such a bright future ahead of her and I knew she was going to go very far. And, you know, these monsters took that opportunity from her,\u201d she said. Laying her to rest During Thursday\u2019s celebration of life service, one of Jocelyn\u2019s favorite songs, \u201cConey Island Baby,\u201d flowed through the crowded room as a slideshow of her life played. The song is from the 1960s and way before her time, but it fit Jocelyn\u2019s eclectic music tastes. Stories emerged about Jocelyn and her sister making slime together and watching sunsets, reminding the room of a life lost too soon. Her great-aunt broke down in tears, but she stirred some laughs when she talked about Jossy\u2019s love for books. \u201cJossy loved to read. Anytime we were at Walmart or any store, that girl would try to beeline for the book section all day, every day,\u201d she said. A reception is being hosted at Gallery Furniture on North Freeway in Houston after the celebration of life to support the family, according to a Facebook post from the store owner. Jim McIngvale, known as \u201cMattress Mack,\u201d\u00a0is well known for his charitable work, like turning his stores into shelters to help people affected by Hurricane Harvey and other severe weather events.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/us/what-we-know-houston-jocelyn-nungaray-killing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "us"}}

Rapidan\u00a0Dam\u00a0near Mankato was in \u201cimminent failure condition,\u201d The Blue Earth County government announced in a Monday Facebook post. \u201cWe do not know if it will totally fail or if it will remain in place, however, we determined it was necessary to issue this notification to advise downstream residents and the correct regulatory agencies and other local agencies,\u201d the county said. The dam \u2013 which has been in a \u201cstate of disrepair,\u201d according to a 2021 study \u2013 was still standing Tuesday afternoon, and the county said there are no current plans for mass evacuations. During a news conference, Gov. Tim Walz cautioned: \u201cWe are not out of the woods yet.\u201d Some communities have not reached peak water levels, he said. The water flow rate peaked Monday and has slightly decreased Tuesday, according to a news release from Blue Earth County emergency management officials. Authorities are continuing to monitor the dam. The flooding in Blue Earth County is threatening the family home of resident Jenny Barnes and their nearby business The Dam Store, CNN affiliate KARE reported. \u201cIt\u2019ll happen. We don\u2019t know when but it\u2019s going to be inevitable that the house is going to go,\u201d Barnes told KARE.

It\u2019s going to take what it wants to take. And everybody pray that it doesn\u2019t take The Dam Store.\u201d During the Tuesday news conference, Minnesota Department of Agriculture Commissioner Thom Petersen highlighted the concerns for farmers. While crops don\u2019t look damaged from a road perspective, Petersen said, the aerials show \u201cthe widespread difficulties our farmers face.\u201d Walz said the town of Waterville, in nearby Le Sueur County, also saw a \u201ccertainly dramatic\u201d impact from the flooding, with dozens of homes flooded up to the second floor. More than 40 National Guard soldiers were deployed to Waterville pump stations to ensure they operate around the clock, protecting critical infrastructure and homes, Minnesota National Guard Maj. Gen. Shawn Manke said during the news conference. Severe flooding has wreaked havoc across the Midwest for several days, leaving at least two people dead. A man in his mid-70s died in Clay County, Iowa, while trying to drive across rapid floodwaters on Saturday, according to a spokesperson from the county sheriff\u2019s office. The same day, an 87-year-old man died in a flood-related crash in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, according to the state highway patrol. In Iowa, days of catastrophic flooding and severe storms prompted President Joe Biden to approve a disaster declaration for some areas, freeing up federal funding for relief efforts. A levee failure Tuesday morning on the Little Sioux River prompted the evacuation of several Iowa communities. The city of Rodney in northern Monona County has been evacuated, with roads closed off to the public, the sheriff\u2019s office said in a Facebook\u00a0post\u00a0Tuesday morning, noting water had breached the levee in several spots. Authorities reported the levee failure just south of the city of Smithland at about 5 a.m. Tuesday, the National Weather Service said. A flash flood warning was issued for Rodney, the nearby city of Smithland and other rural areas near the river, officials said. About 30 miles north, significant flooding left the city of Correctionville closed to non-residents, according to\u00a0Woodbury County Emergency Management. Further north in Sioux City, the Big Sioux River crested at 45 feet, which is 7.3 feet above historic levels, prompting homes along the river to be evacuated Monday, officials said. Water rescue efforts continued on Tuesday afternoon, said South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. The governor said one neighborhood in North Sioux City \u2013 McCook Lake \u2013 was in a \u201cvery dangerous situation\u201d with residents attempting to re-enter the area. \u201cWhole homes have fallen\u201d into McCook Lake, which is separated from Big Sioux River by Interstate 29, Noem said. The neighborhood has uprooted trees, live power lines across roads and 100-foot drop-offs in places where roads were washed out, along with other debris, the governor said. Officials don\u2019t expect the water levels to rise any further, Noem said, but she urged residents to stay away from the area as water levels recede \u201cslowly.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be safe for several days,\u201d said Noem. \u201cIf there\u2019s water, don\u2019t drive through it. If there\u2019s a barricade, don\u2019t drive around it.\u201d In Minnesota, Blue Earth County officials were first notified Sunday of \u201caccumulating debris\u201d at the Rapidan Dam. Workers from Blue Earth County Public Works, the emergency management agency and the sheriff\u2019s office are actively monitoring the dam, according to the Facebook post. The Blue Earth River has cut around the west side of the\u00a0dam, emergency management said, carrying\u00a0damaging debris and causing power outages. In a Monday evening update, the county noted that although there was a \u201cpartial failure on the west abutment,\u201d the \u201cdam is still intact.\u201d \u201cOur agencies are in close contact with Blue Earth County and other local officials regarding the Rapidan Dam near Mankato,\u201d Gov. Walz said in a statement Monday. \u201cEmergency management is on the ground and acting quickly to ensure the safety of Minnesotans as the situation develops.\u201d The\u00a0dam, which was\u00a0completed in 1910, is owned by the county and is capable of generating 6 million watts of hydroelectric power. It\u2019s about 70 miles southwest of Minneapolis. Dams can break for a number of reasons, including overtopping due to flooding and structural failure, according to FEMA. A 2021 report from Blue Earth County noted that regular flooding over the years, along with the \u201ctoll of time,\u201d have caused significant damage to the dam. The report identified two solutions: repair or remove the dam. The county noted that both options have significant costs.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/us/rapidan-dam-collapse-risk-minnesota/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_us_new-york-tech-ceo-murder-conviction", "text": "The former executive assistant of a tech CEO was found guilty Monday of murdering his boss \u2013 whom he then decapitated and dismembered \u2013 in 2020, according to a\u00a0news release from the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office. Prosecutors said Tyrese Haspil, 25, killed Fahim Saleh, 33, to prevent him from learning Haspil had embezzled about $400,000 from the venture capitalist and\u00a0CEO of Gokada, a Nigerian motorcycle ride-hail company. A jury on Monday found Haspil guilty of one count of first-degree murder, two counts of second-degree grand larceny, one count of second-degree burglary and other charges, according to the DA\u2019s office statement. \u201cTyrese Haspil tragically cut Mr. Saleh\u2019s life short \u2013 a man who came from a close-knit immigrant family and followed his passions to become a successful entrepreneur,\u201d Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said. \u201cI hope the accountability delivered by today\u2019s verdict can provide a measure of comfort to Mr. Saleh\u2019s loved ones as they continue to mourn his loss.\u201d CNN has reached out to Haspil\u2019s attorney Sam Roberts at The Legal Aid Society, which represents New Yorkers who cannot pay for legal services, for comment. Haspil is expected to be sentenced in September, according to the release. Haspil became Saleh\u2019s assistant in May 2018, where he was tasked with a variety of responsibilities\u00a0including handling Saleh\u2019s\u00a0finances \u2013 which is how he\u00a0gained access to Saleh\u2019s financial records, according to the DA\u2019s office release. That fall, Haspil\u00a0began stealing from Saleh\u2019s companies using two separate schemes, the DA\u2019s office stated.\u00a0Haspil created\u00a0several financial accounts, including a PayPal account, to funnel funds into the accounts while\u00a0also\u00a0creating fake statements and mimicking\u00a0transactions\u00a0that would go undetected by his boss, according to the release. Haspil resigned in May 2019, but continued to steal money, the release said. In January 2020, after one of the frauds was found and traced to Haspil, Saleh confronted his former mentee for stealing $35,000 from his company\u00a0and proposed a settlement to pay back the debt and avoid criminal prosecution,\u00a0according to the release. Haspil agreed to pay back\u00a0Saleh\u00a0over an agreed upon two-year period but did so using the\u00a0stolen money from the PayPal financial scheme, causing him to embezzle nearly $400,000,\u00a0according to the DA\u2019s office. Fearing Saleh would learn of his continued embezzlement, Haspil then decided to plot Saleh\u2019s murder \u2013 believing that killing his former boss would prevent Saleh from testifying against him, according to the release. On July 13, 2020, Haspil followed Saleh into his Lower East Side condo, tased him in the back and stabbed him multiple times, the release stated. The next day, Haspil returned to the apartment \u201cto dismember the body and clean up the crime scene,\u201d according to the release. Haspil left briefly while attempting to clean the crime scene, and Saleh\u2019s cousin, who went to the apartment to check on him, found Saleh\u2019s body with his head and limbs severed, the release said. Haspil did not re-enter the apartment after seeing police outside. On July 17, police arrested Haspil\u00a0in Manhattan. Saleh was well known for\u00a0his support of fledgling techies. He was born in Saudi Arabia to Bangladeshi parents.\u00a0He grew up in upstate New York\u00a0and had a computer science degree from Bentley University in Massachusetts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/us/new-york-tech-ceo-murder-conviction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_06_26_us_robert-crimo-july-fourth-shooting-plea", "text": "Robert Crimo III, the man accused of opening fire from a rooftop onto Fourth of July parade revelers in Highland Park, Illinois, two years ago,\u00a0killing seven people\u00a0and injuring dozens, backed out of a proposed plea deal in a dramatic court hearing Wednesday. In court, prosecutors said they and Crimo had agreed to a deal in which Crimo would plead guilty to seven murder counts and 48 counts of aggravated battery, one for each named victim in the indictment. In exchange, he agreed to be sentenced to natural life in prison, and the rest of the charges would be dismissed. The judge then asked Crimo, who was brought into the room in a wheelchair, whether he accepted the plea deal, but he did not respond. His attorneys asked the court for a recess to discuss the deal with him further, and they then left the courtroom. When they returned, the judge again asked Crimo whether he wished to go forward with the plea deal, and he said \u201cNo.\u201d The judge then tentatively set a trial for February 25, 2025. Victims\u2019 family members and attorneys expressed their frustrations outside court Wednesday. \u201cWe came to court today in hopes that we could put this out of our minds,\u201d said Leah Sundheim, the daughter of victim Jacquelyn Sundheim. \u201cWe have the 4th of July coming up, and it will be two years, and all I wanted was to be able to fully grieve my mom without the looming trial, knowing he was going to spend the rest of his life in jail, and instead we were yet again shown his complete and blatant disregard for humans, for anyone, for all of us, in that courtroom.\u201d Crimo previously pleaded not guilty to 21 counts of first-degree murder \u2013 three for each deceased victim \u2013 as well as 48 counts of attempted murder and 48 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm for each victim struck by a bullet, bullet fragment or shrapnel, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, as Illinois does not have the death penalty. The charges stem from the mass shooting in Highland Park, a wealthy suburb north of Chicago, at an Independence Day parade just after 10 a.m. The shooter was perched on a rooftop overlooking the parade route and used a high-powered rifle \u201csimilar to an AR-15\u201d to fire more than 70 rounds into the crowd, sending hundreds of attendees fleeing in terror, authorities said. Crimo, 21 at the time, dressed in women\u2019s clothing\u00a0to conceal his identity and used makeup to cover his tattoos during the shooting, according to investigators. Afterward, he allegedly left the roof and blended in with the fleeing crowd, sparking a regional hunt for his whereabouts. He was arrested after a brief car chase in nearby Lake Forest later that day. He admitted he carried out the attack and said he emptied two 30-round magazines before loading the weapon with a third and continuing to fire, authorities said in court. The attack left seven people dead, including five people over the age of 60. The victims were Katherine Goldstein, 64; Irina McCarthy, 35; Kevin McCarthy, 37; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; Stephen Straus, 88; Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78; and Eduardo Uvaldo, 69. Another 48 people were injured, including an 8-year-old boy who was paralyzed by a shot to the back. Attorneys and victims\u2019 families slam hearing This is not the first time Crimo has reversed himself on a key courtroom issue. In December, he asked to represent himself at trial, but then backed off that request and asked for a public defender less than a month later, according to CNN affiliate WLS. Outside court after Wednesday\u2019s hearing, several victims\u2019 families and their attorneys criticized Crimo and suggested he knew beforehand he would back out of the deal. \u201cHe is evil and manipulative and brought us here today probably knowing what he was going to do,\u201d Leah Sundheim said. Karina Mendez, the daughter of victim Eduardo Uvaldo, said she had been hoping for the best but knew it was not a done deal. \u201cI knew that could happen,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s been playing a lot of games.\u201d Antonio Romanucci, an attorney who represents several victims\u2019 families in civil suits, said Crimo was continuing to carry out a \u201creign of terror.\u201d \u201cThis was a calculated effort on his part to continue the suffering that our clients are going through,\u201d he said. He also acknowledged that those in court Wednesday had some skepticism about the plea deal. \u201cI know that there was a lot of disappointment and shock in the room when he said the word, \u2018No,\u2019 but to say that we were all entirely surprised by him, I think that would not be true, because we\u2019ve seen him do these things before,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was his opportunity to put his thumb in everyone\u2019s eye that was in that courtroom because he brought them in there.\u201d Lake County State\u2019s Attorney Eric Rinehart told reporters his team had been working with the victims and survivors to prepare for the hearing. \u201cWe are available for them not only throughout the rest of the day, but until this goes to trial,\u201d Rinehart said. \u201cWe will continue to support them. We will be ready for trial.\u201d Shooter legally purchased weapons despite run-ins with police The shooter legally purchased multiple weapons, including the one used in the attack, even though he had two encounters with police in 2019 related to threats to himself and others, according to authorities. Officers performed a welfare check on Crimo III in April 2019, after he \u201cattempted to commit suicide by machete,\u201d a police report states. An attorney for his parents has disputed details of the incidents described in police reports. Police returned to the home in September 2019 after a family member reported Crimo III said he was going to kill everyone, directing the threat at those in his home, according to a police report. Officers confiscated several knives from Crimo III\u2019s closet, but his\u00a0father retrieved them from the police station\u00a0later that day, per the report. Still, Crimo III bought five guns, including two rifles, in the years after the September 2019 visit from police, according to Chris Covelli, a spokesperson for the Lake County Major Crimes Task Force. The shooter\u2019s father, Robert Crimo Jr., pleaded guilty last November to seven counts of misdemeanor reckless conduct for signing his son\u2019s application\u00a0for an\u00a0Illinois Firearm Owners Identification card\u00a0in 2019, months after the police reports about his concerning behavior. The card is required for gun purchases in Illinois, and people under 21 need a guardian to sign the application. As part of the plea deal, Crimo Jr. was sentenced to 60 days in jail and two years of probation, and he agreed to testify against his son if called. Prior to the shooting, Crimo III posted music on several major streaming platforms under the pseudonym Awake the Rapper, and he apparently made and posted music videos online featuring ominous lyrics and animated scenes of gun violence. In one video entitled \u201cAre you Awake,\u201d a cartoon animation of a stick-figure shooter resembling the suspect\u2019s appearance is seen wearing tactical gear and carrying out an attack with a rifle. Crimo, seen with multicolored hair and face tattoos, narrates, \u201cI need to just do it. It is my destiny.\u201d In January 2023, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed into law legislation that bans the sale of assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines. The law also requires people who already own semi-automatic rifles to register their ownership. In November 2023, the Illinois Supreme Court upheld the law in a 4-3 ruling after\u00a0months of legal challenges, during which the Supreme Court had declined to intervene. This story has been updated with additional information. Correction:\u00a0An earlier version of this story understated the number of people injured in the shooting. It was 48.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/us/robert-crimo-july-fourth-shooting-plea/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "us"}}

Nine were on college campuses, and 25 were on K-12 school grounds. The incidents left 16 people dead and at least 38 other victims injured, according to CNN\u2019s analysis of events reported by the Gun Violence Archive, Education Week and Everytown for Gun Safety. CNN cross checks these reports of school shootings against school and police accounts and media reports. All incidents of gun violence are included if they occurred on school property, from kindergartens through colleges/universities, and at least one person was shot, not including the shooter. School property includes but is not limited to, buildings, fields, parking lots, stadiums and buses. Accidental discharges of firearms are included, as long as at least one person is shot, but not if the sole shooter is law enforcement or school security. In the first year of the pandemic, when schools were closed, there was a major decline in gun violence incidents on school grounds. Since then, recent years saw a stark increase in school shootings, with 2021, 2022 and 2023 all setting records since at least 2008. There were at least 82 incidents in 2023, but 2022 was one of the deadliest years, with 46 fatalities, according to CNN\u2019s analysis. That year saw the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, where 19 students and two educators were killed and more than a dozen others were injured. Students and educators have engaged in activism around the issue of gun violence, and some educators have quit the profession. Some states in the south have seen the highest rate of school shootings relative to their populations since 2008, according to CNN\u2019s analysis. Washington, DC had the highest rate \u2014 6 total shootings, more than 0.8 per 100,000 people \u2014 while Texas had the most overall with 60 school shootings.
