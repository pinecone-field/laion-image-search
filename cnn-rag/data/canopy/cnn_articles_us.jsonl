{"id": "2024_07_05_media_abc-biden-interview", "text": "When ABC News first secured its exclusive interview with President Joe Biden, the rollout plan was paint-by-numbers. But these are not normal times. So ABC accelerated its timing. Anchor George\u00a0Stephanopoulos is expected to interview Biden on Friday in Wisconsin, the president\u2019s first extended interview with a major media network since his disastrous debate performance last week that has led many in the Democratic Party to question whether Biden should be the nominee. ABC had planned to release clips Friday evening, and the whole interview would air during Stephanopoulos\u2019 Sunday morning show,\u00a0\u201cThis Week With George Stephanopoulos.\u201d Recognizing this extraordinary political moment, however, ABC had a change of heart. ABC News realized it would be uncomfortable to hold onto the interview for nearly two days, according to a source familiar with the matter. ABC may have been accused, fairly or not, of hiding something, and the news cycle is moving at a rapid pace. A network source told CNN that because the story is of \u201cnational interest,\u201d ABC decided to make it a \u201cprimetime special\u201d to air the same day the interview is taking place. When ABC executives agreed to a time slot for the interview on Friday evening, they notified the White House and changed course, the source said. The interview will air in its entirety on Friday evening at 8 pm ET, and a full transcript will be posted as well. The interview will be a critical opportunity for voters to be able to gauge Biden\u2019s abilities in an unscripted, high-stakes setting. It\u2019s not clear how long the interview will end up lasting, but ABC affiliates have it slated for a 30-minute special. The stakes are high for Biden.\u00a0At last week\u2019s debate, hosted by CNN, Biden\u00a0struggled to complete sentences at times\u00a0and often looked lost as former President Donald Trump pumped out falsehoods, urgently raising questions about Biden\u2019s age and ability to serve a second term. But a lot is also riding on Stephanopoulos, who will be expected to pose tough questions to the president about his age, his abilities and the future of this election. Many will also be looking to see how\u00a0Stephanopoulos, himself a former White House communications director under President Bill Clinton, approaches any questions about the White House team\u2019s handling of communications around Biden\u2019s age.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/media/abc-biden-interview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_us_san-antonio-hot-car-children-arrest", "text": "A mother who police said left her three children in a hot car in San Antonio, Texas, for nearly an hour while shopping was arrested after a good Samaritan helped rescue them from the vehicle. Officers were dispatched to the location after receiving a call from a bystander alerting them there were children inside a vehicle that was turned off, the San Antonio Police Department\u00a0said in its preliminary report. First responders discovered a 1-month-old, 2-year-old, and 4-year-old in the car. \u201cThe mother of the children (suspect) was at the scene and stated she went inside a store and did not realize how long she was gone,\u201d the department said. \u201cBased on information gathered, the children were in the car for approximately 50 minutes.\u201d Angela Garza\u2013Amador was arrested June 28 and charged with three counts of abandoning/endangering a child, according to the report. She was released on bond June 29, according to the Bexar County Sheriff\u2019s Office. It is unclear if Garza\u2013Amador has legal representation. A woman who rescued the children and took a video of the moment told CNN affiliate KENS she was walking toward a children\u2019s clothing store when she noticed a young boy in the car next to her. She said she felt her \u201cmother\u2019s instincts\u201d and decided to looked inside and found another child in the car and alerted store employees to call 911. She then tried to open the car door and found it unlocked and helped the children while waiting for first responders to arrive. \u201cThe boy, he was really sweating profusely, and you know, was crying. It seemed like he was grasping for air to me, like they were already on that verge,\u201d the woman, who wanted to remain anonymous, told KENS. \u201cA lot of parents think, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s OK, I\u2019ll be right back,\u2019 but so much can happen in that time frame.\u201d In the video, at least three women can be seen helping get the three children out of the car, including a baby from its car seat, as the three-year-old boy cries while struggling to breath. \u201cI live across town, I hadn\u2019t been there to that store I was going to in 10 years,\u201d she added. \u201cI feel that God literally sent me over there for those kids.\u201d The temperature in the San Antonio area at the time was between 98 and 100 degrees. A National Weather Service chart comparing outside and inside-the-car temperatures showed after one hour inside a car with an outside temperature of 93 degrees, the temperature in the vehicle could reach up to 130 degrees. The children were transported to a hospital for treatment and were expected to be discharged from the hospital the same day, according to the preliminary police report. Child protective services was notified of the incident, police said. \u201cWhile details of investigations are confidential according to law, I can confirm there was no open case regarding this family when the report of this incident came in,\u201d a Texas Department of Family and Protective Services spokesperson told CNN. \u201cThe children were not placed in CPS care and were placed in the care of family.\u201d There have been at least seven hot car children\u2019s deaths in 2024, according to Kids and Car Safety, an organization researching and documenting car death data. At least 1,090 children have died in hot cars nationwide since 1990.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/us/san-antonio-hot-car-children-arrest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_politics_trump-distance-project-2025", "text": "Former President Donald Trump on Friday sought to distance himself from a closely aligned conservative group\u2019s plans to radically reshape the federal government and American life should the former president win a second term. In a post\u00a0to his social media site, Trump claimed, \u201cI know nothing about Project 2025,\u201d the name given to a playbook crafted by the Heritage Foundation to fill the executive branch with thousands of Trump loyalists and reorient its many agencies\u2019 missions around conservative ideals. \u201cI have no idea who is behind it,\u201d Trump continued on Truth Social. \u201cI disagree with some of the things they\u2019re saying and some of the things they\u2019re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal. Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them.\u201d The post comes days after the president of the Heritage Foundation, Kevin Roberts, drew widespread backlash from Democrats for saying in an interview that the country was \u201cin the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.\u201d Project 2025 \u2014 widely viewed by conservatives as a blueprint for Trump\u2019s second term transition \u2014 is run by several former Trump administration officials and includes many policy priorities that are aligned with those of the former president, especially as they relate to cracking down on immigration and purging the federal bureaucracy by making it easier to dismiss civil servants and career officials. But it also includes controversial proposals Trump has not discussed, including banning pornography, reversing federal approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, excluding the morning-after pill and men\u2019s contraceptives from coverage mandated under the Affordable Care Act, and making it harder for transgender adults to transition. Among the chief objectives of Project 2025, its authors wrote, is: \u201cRestore the family as the centerpiece of American life and protect our children.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign has sought for months to make clear that Project 2025 is not its official policy platform amid an intensifying effort by President Joe Biden and Democrats to tie Trump to its more controversial policies. Yet those efforts are complicated by Trump\u2019s extremely close relationship with many of the people who launched Project 2025 or helped contribute to it. Paul Dans, the head of Project 2025, was chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management during the Trump administration, and the group\u2019s roadmap for the next administration includes contributions from others who have worked for the former president, including his former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, former acting Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli and former deputy chief of staff Rick Dearborn. John McEntee, Trump\u2019s former director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office and one of his closest aides while in office, is also a senior adviser for the project. Trump himself told a gathering of religious broadcasters in February that Roberts was \u201cdoing an unbelievable job\u201d and \u201cbringing (Heritage) back to levels never seen.\u201d The remarks came at a Nashville conference shortly after Roberts and Dans both addressed the same crowd. Dans shared with the audience it was his intention to serve in a second Trump administration should the former president win in November. Speaking before Trump about Project 2025 that night, Roberts said, \u201cWe want no credit\u201d for the groundwork it is laying, and instead wanted \u201cPresident Trump and his administration to take credit for that.\u201d The group has long stated its transition project is a template they hope will be adopted by the next Republican president, something a Project 2025 spokeswoman reiterated in a statement to CNN. \u201cAs we\u2019ve been saying for more than two years now, Project 2025 does not speak for any candidate or campaign. We are a coalition of more than 110 conservative groups advocating policy and personnel recommendations for the next conservative president. But it is ultimately up to that president, who we believe will be President Trump, to decide which recommendations to implement,\u201d the statement reads. A senior Trump campaign adviser told CNN that Trump\u2019s post disavowing the group stemmed from a series of factors, most notably the Biden campaign\u2019s recent messaging campaign tying Trump to the project. Project 2025 has long frustrated Trump and his top advisers, who have been annoyed with the amount of coverage its policy platforms have received and the perception that the group is working in tandem with the campaign \u2014 despite Project 2025 partnering with a series of top Trump allies. The group\u2019s partners\u00a0include several leading conservative groups with close ties to Trump\u2019s campaign, including those who have been tapped by Trump\u2019s advisers to serve as part of their 2024 ground game strategy\u00a0in key battleground states, such as Turning Points USA. Other high-profile organizations partnered with Project 2025 include the Center for Renewing America, run by Trump\u2019s former director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russ Vought, who is viewed by many in Trump\u2019s orbit as a likely contender for another Cabinet position in a second administration and is helping to lead the GOP platform committee ahead of the Republican National Convention later this month. The Conservative Partnership Institute, run in part by Trump\u2019s former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Sen. Jim Demint, and America Legal First, founded by his immigration adviser Stephen Miller, are also partners. The Biden campaign on Friday quickly dismissed Trump\u2019s attempts to keep Project 2025 at arm\u2019s length. \u200b\u200b\u201cProject 2025 is the extreme policy and personnel playbook for Trump\u2019s second term that should scare the hell out of the American people,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cProject 2025 staff and leadership routinely tout their connections to Trump\u2019s team, and are the same people leading the RNC policy platform and Trump\u2019s debate prep, campaign, and inner circle.\u201d The Trump campaign has previously pushed back on reports about plans Trump\u2019s allies are looking to implement if Trump wins reelection. Trump\u2019s campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita issued a statement in November arguing that \u201creports about personnel and policies that are specific to a second Trump Administration are purely speculative and theoretical\u201d and that no outside groups have the authority to speak on behalf of Trump or the campaign. LaCivita doubled down further on Friday, tweeting: \u201cPoke the Bear you are going to be bit\u201d while sharing an article titled: \u201cTrump torches Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/politics/trump-distance-project-2025/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_us_fireworks-july-4-essay-cec", "text": "My pregnant mom was certain she knew how things would go that night. It was late afternoon, but she already had movie tickets in her pocket. I wasn\u2019t due for another month. And my parents were excited to see \u201cStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\u201d in a few hours. But I surprised my family with a different sort of spectacle. My mom\u2019s water broke while she was washing the dishes that day. And I made my entrance on July 4, just after 10 p.m., when surely a few fireworks were still lighting up the Chicago sky. The idea that I burst into the world during the event\u2019s finale is a bit of family lore I\u2019ve always loved retelling. For decades, the beauty and fun of fireworks were deeply intertwined with the way I saw my country and myself. To me, these were facts as indisputable as the wetness of water or the blueness of the sky. But I see things differently now. And that\u2019s something I never expected. Fireworks were a huge part of my \u20184th of July Baby\u2019 identity Growing up, it\u2019s not an overstatement to say no one loved going to see July 4 fireworks more than I did. Yes, it was a bit of a blow to my only-child, millennial mentality to learn at a young age that all the festivities that day weren\u2019t just for me. But I quickly learned to love sharing my 4th of July birthday with America. It\u2019s amazing for most of your loved ones to have the day off on your birthday, and for everyone around you to be celebrating. Gifts emblazoned with American flags became a beloved part of my birthday repertoire, from earrings to T-shirts to teddy bears. I loved flaunting my patriotism. As a toddler, I learned to belt out \u201cGod Bless America,\u201d \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and, of course, \u201cI\u2019m a Yankee Doodle Dandy.\u201d More than anything, I loved going with my family to watch the fireworks. There was nothing like the feeling of seeing colors burst into the sky as the symphony played the triumphant finale of the 1812 Overture. The boom of the cannons was thrilling. And the way those extra sparkly golden fireworks crackled gave me the good kind of goosebumps. Even when it was clear the show had ended, I\u2019d look upward toward the wisps of smoke in the atmosphere and hope there might still be more. As I grew older and life got busier, my birthday celebrations became more muted. Sometimes I\u2019d have to work. Sometimes there wasn\u2019t time to plan a party. But no matter, what, I\u2019d have one requirement. \u201cAll I want is to see at least one firework in the sky,\u201d was a refrain I repeated many times when asked how I planned to celebrate. On my 35th birthday, that\u2019s just what I said. And my boyfriend granted that wish, taking me to see a lovely firework display in a town square outside Atlanta. We watched children playing with sparklers and listened to a concert band play as dusk fell. It was as idyllic an American night as anyone could have imagined. But the next day I\u2019d learn that a family I knew had a very different experience that night, only a few miles away. It was their first July 4 in America I first met Abdalla Munye and his family in January 2017, days after the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban went into effect. Abdalla, his wife Habibo and seven children who made the journey with them had only been living in the US for a few days. These Somali refugees were supposed to be starting their new lives, but instead found themselves at a press conference, sobbing in front of strangers. Because of the travel ban, they feared they might never see their daughter, Batulo, again. Officials had booked her on a separate flight a few days after theirs, and the surprise travel ban left her stranded in a refugee camp in Kenya. I spent weeks alongside the family, chronicling how the travel ban affected them. When courts blocked the policy and Batulo finally made it to the US nearly a month later, I was with them at the Atlanta airport and was able to share the story of their reunion with millions of people. Knowing that moment would mark the end of one journey and the beginning of another, we stayed in touch, and I kept visiting them for months so I could tell the story of their first year in America. That\u2019s when an unexpected conversation we had opened my eyes to a reality I\u2019d never considered. I visited Abdalla and his family the day after my birthday, on July 5, 2017, and I still remember how struck I was by what he said. I\u2019d expected him to tell me his family had spent their first Independence Day in America having a cookout, or maybe watching a parade, or gazing in wonder as beautiful fireworks illuminated the sky. But when I asked how their July 4 had been, Abdalla said they\u2019d spent the night hiding in the dark in their apartment, afraid to go outside. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked, naively. Abdalla told me the sounds they\u2019d heard outside made them think of the night when their oldest daughter had been raped and murdered. Memories of war and bloodshed and tragedy raced through his mind. He\u2019d been taught in his refugee orientation that July 4 was a time for celebration in the United States, but he couldn\u2019t believe that\u2019s what was unfolding around them. For Abdalla, there was only one possibility. The dangers they\u2019d fled had found them here, too. In my steno pad, I jotted down Abdalla\u2019s description of the experience. \u201cIt sounded,\u201d he said, \u201clike Somalia.\u201d What a series of panicked text messages reminded me Six months later, on New Year\u2019s Eve, I got a series of frantic WhatsApp message from Abdalla that I\u2019ll never forget. Hello! This is Abdalla how are you doing I hope u doing good, how is the weather today does it change like Somalia we had some booms in our area what is going on we almost to run, don\u2019t forget when u are running tell us too to run on our side. At first, I was puzzled by what he\u2019d written. Then I thought back to our conversation in July. New Year\u2019s revelry was frightening his family the same way Independence Day festivities had. He was asking me what I was hearing on the other side of town. And he wanted me to alert him if I was fleeing, so his family would be able to escape in time, too. I tried writing a brief explanation to reassure him. And I sent a photo of fireworks, too. Abdalla\u2019s English had improved so much since his arrival, but he was still learning. I hoped the image would calm his fears and clarify any confusion in case something had gotten lost in translation. \u201cHere people sometimes celebrate the New Year with fireworks\u2026you don\u2019t need to run! How are you doing?\u201d His response made it clear he was unconvinced. Am fine but u say that it sounds like booms it\u2019s not the way u think. And it is night and why are they booming night time. \u201cIt is just a tradition for some people. \u2026 I know it is scary to hear,\u201d I wrote. \u201cHopefully it will stop soon and you can get some rest.\u201d Ok let us pray to God in the morning to wake up peacefully with kids. The idea that fireworks had inspired this exchange was a sobering reminder that\u2019s stuck with me ever since. By the time my next birthday rolled around, so much had changed in my life. I\u2019d moved to the Washington, DC area, and it had been months since I\u2019d spoken with Abdalla and his family. I watched fireworks with my fianc\u00e9 from an apartment rooftop, and I laughed as I heard my friend\u2019s son gleefully shouting, \u201cHi, fireworks!\u201d as they lit up the horizon. But in my mind, I heard Abdalla\u2019s voice, too, even though he was hundreds of miles away. The way I celebrate July 4 has changed I have thought about my conversations with Abdalla and his family many times over the years. The visual beauty of fireworks still wows me. But every July 4, I now find myself closing my eyes for a few moments, and hearing how those same sounds could so easily be a very different kind of explosion. I think about how lucky I have been to live my whole life without a shred of doubt that the boom of a firework was a sound of celebration. And I think about how so many others have stories like Abdalla\u2019s. The UN refugee agency estimates there are now more 117 million forcibly displaced people in the world \u2014 roughly equal to a third of the entire US population. I think back on my mom, washing the dishes 42 years ago, with movie tickets in her pocket and no doubt in her mind about what that July 4 had in store. Until everything changed in an instant. So many times, we are so certain about our futures, only to find out something unexpected awaits us. That\u2019s the beauty and the terror of living. Abdalla never expected people in his own family to be killed as armed groups ravaged the Somali countryside. He never expected to be forced by war to flee his home. He never expected a US president\u2019s decision would throw his life into chaos. He never expected to end up on the other side of the world, hiding in his apartment with the lights off in the place where he thought he\u2019d be safe. I don\u2019t speak with Abdalla as regularly as I once did when writing about his family. But I try to stay in touch with people who\u2019ve trusted me to help share their stories. It\u2019s been more than seven years since we first met, and Abdalla and I still exchange text messages every so often. He sent me photos of Batulo\u2019s wedding. After my own daughter was born a few years ago, I sent him pictures of our family, too. He wrote to me recently to ask how my daughter was doing. And I asked him about his family and their plans for July 4 this year. They now live in Kentucky, where Abdalla works for Amazon sorting clothing returns. These days, Abdalla says his family is more prepared for July 4. \u201cWe are used to it,\u201d he says. \u201cIn America we see people celebrating it. And we also changed.\u201d America is their country now, too. And Abdalla says his family has grown accustomed to watching their neighbors lighting fireworks. \u201cThat is how we celebrate with them,\u201d he says.

{"id": "2024_07_03_us_navajo-nation-power-grid-connection", "text": "Katherine Benally\u00a0sat between two open windows in her small home and looked out over a\u00a0sun-baked field in the Chuska Mountain foothills of the vast Navajo Nation. As she waited for the cooling cross breeze, the 74-year-old recalled fondly the days when her family grew squash, corn and pumpkin on this property. They sought shade under its trees and had no need for electricity or other modern conveniences. \u201cThe weather,\u201d she said, \u201cit wasn\u2019t that hot.\u201d But that\u2019s all changed: The Navajo Nation last year declared an extreme heat emergency as temperatures hit well above 110 degrees in parts of the region. And the heat just keeps coming. These days, Benally barely steps outside her home. What she wants is to go outdoors more often, then return to the cool kiss of air conditioning. \u201cThat would be perfect,\u201d she said, smiling. But Benally \u2013 like 13,000 families in roughly a third of Navajo Nation households \u2013 is still off the electrical grid. Like many here, she uses solar panels to power essentials, such as a small refrigerator and a couple of light bulbs. But the power doesn\u2019t last all day. Now, as global temperatures keep rising, the rush to fully electrify one of the poorest regions in the United States is more urgent than ever. To that end, several power poles laid flat this month on Benally\u2019s land, waiting to be installed so she can connect to the power grid for the first time.\u00a0Thanks to a non-profit initiative called Light Up Navajo, 46 utility companies from 16 states are partnering this year with the Navajo Nation\u2019s utility authority to build dozens of miles of power lines under the same kind of mutual aid pacts that help restore power after natural disasters. It\u2019s no easy task in an area known for its\u00a0rugged terrain and arid climate.\u00a0But it\u2019s ever more critical to the health and safety of a community that traces its roots in the American Southwest back at least 800 years. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy that this still happens in America,\u201d said Bryan English, a crew foreman with Trico Electric Cooperative in Arizona who\u2019s working his second year in a row on the project. Connecting a home a mile from Benally\u2019s, English wiped sweat from his brow: \u201cI don\u2019t think any part of America shouldn\u2019t have electricity in 2024.\u201d Business and political factors pose obstacles Roughly the size of West Virginia, the Navajo Nation long has been rich with energy sources and production. But while private companies tapped those resources in the 20th\u00a0century to help electrify areas around the Southwest, the Navajo Nation reaped few benefits. \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly unique rural situation,\u201d said Dave Lock with the Grand Canyon State Electric Cooperative Association. \u201cA hundred years ago, when the rural electrification effort came into focus, a lot of rural areas across the country were like Navajo Nation: It wasn\u2019t profitable for the for-profit utilities to go out and bring them power because of the long distances.\u201d That changed under President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s administration in the 1930s, when farmers banded together to create rural co-ops to power remote parts of the country, using federal loans under the Rural Electrification Act. But many Native American nations at the time were still trying to assimilate and fell behind in the electrification efforts, according to a 2023 US Energy Department report to Congress. The non-profit Navajo Tribal Utility Authority started up in 1959 to help rectify the issue, but a complex myriad of political and geographical obstacles have made it more difficult to get the nation fully on the grid. Among the hurdles, the federal government put a 40-year development ban \u2013 known as the Bennett Freeze \u2013 across roughly 1.5 million acres of Navajo land to settle a dispute between the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe. The ban, lifted in 2009, barred installation of electricity and other key infrastructure. The slow, steady slog to connect households to the power grid is expensive. Today, it costs the Navajo Nation $40,000 per family, largely due to the remote, desert land. It\u2019s a massive financial challenge in an area where the average annual household income is just over $30,000, less than half the national rate. Without help from projects like Light Up Navajo,\u00a0it could cost close to $1 billion to extend electricity to all 13,000 families, tribal utility authorities estimate.\u00a0That astronomical sum \u2013 including hundreds of millions of dollars for transmission lines, electric substations and house wiring \u2013 is a huge reason other cooperatives have decided to help, their representatives said. In 2019, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority partnered with the American Public Power Association, a non-profit industry lobbying group, to create Light Up Navajo, which so far has connected almost 850 families. But even with help from utilities across the country and groups like the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, another trade group, it could take three more decades to run power to every household. The partnership relies on a mix of private and federal funding. Workers come out for a 13-week stretch each spring and summer to set up the connections, while the tribal utility authority works year-round to get the homes shovel-ready. The task is \u201cfar from over,\u201d said Deenise Becenti, the tribal utility authority\u2019s government and public affairs manager. But when companies volunteer manpower and services, it makes the overall mission feel within reach. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Light Up Navajo,\u201d she said, \u201csome of the families who\u2019ve already received electricity would still be on the waiting list for years to come.\u201d Using cars to charge phones and feel cool air Living without connected electricity had been a way of life for so many in the Navajo Nation. But with the climate changing and technology advancing, many families are signing up to get on the Light Up Navajo waiting list. Without a grid connection, residents use their vehicles to charge cell phones or get a brief taste of air conditioning. One young family in Crystal, New Mexico, with a 2-year-old and a baby on the way picks up fresh produce and meat daily from a store 45 minutes away, then cooks dinner over a campfire before the sun goes down, they said. They don\u2019t have a working refrigerator. Many families use camp-style coolers to store food, but those need constant supplies of ice, which quickly melts. Thirty miles south, Arlene Henry,\u00a056, lives on a small compound with her sisters, children and grandchildren. She planted a tree, hoping to land at least a sliver of shade on their property, but insects thwarted its potential. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for shade all the time,\u201d Henry said. Her family sits outside in the afternoons and seeks relief in the shadow of her home, moving seats around the house to hide from the roving sun. \u201cWe sometimes bring ice, but it just melts right then and there.\u201d Solar panels power the family\u2019s refrigerator, two light bulbs and the flashlights they use to get to their outhouse at night. More than anything, Henry worries about her adult son, who relies on supplemental oxygen and has trouble keeping the tank powered full-time, she said. In 90-degree heat, she recently eyed her 2-year-old granddaughter riding around on a red tricycle. The little girl enjoyed an ice pop. But after a few minutes, Henry urged her to come back to the shade. \u201cCome this way, baby, come this way,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s too hot over there.\u201d Henry clutched some framed photos of her parents and grandparents who grew up on this land and passed it down to her and her sisters. But now, the lack of electricity scares her \u2013 though she also doesn\u2019t want to leave this place that means so much. \u201cI thought it was normal,\u201d she said of growing up without electricity. \u201cBut now it\u2019s getting to me.\u201d A single bulb \u2013 and a face \u2013 light up So far this summer, Light Up Navajo has connected\u00a0125 homes with 38 miles of power lines built and a goal of connecting\u00a025 more homes by the end of July, when the rainy season starts. William Lee Tom Jr.,\u00a056, benefited from one of those new connections this summer. He\u2019s lived the past 15 years without electricity near Window Rock, Arizona, and didn\u2019t want to leave because he can afford this house and it\u2019s close to his family. Before the power hookup, Tom and his son often slept outside in his truck or in a wooden, tent-like structure when it got too hot. Once, while out on errands, his son had to go to the hospital due to dehydration, Tom said. \u201cA lot of times, it\u2019s just unbearable,\u201d he said. Power line workers with Light Up Navajo recently installed poles at Tom\u2019s property, and on June 13, they strung up the final wires to electrify his house.\u00a0The crew wore long-sleeved work shirts and white hard hats, with cloth covers draping from the back to protect their necks from the scorching sun. After a lineman flipped a few switches on a new breaker box, Tom walked inside and turned on his only light bulb \u2013 one he\u2019d just bought and installed an hour earlier. The dark room now had light, but it was the normally reserved mechanic\u2019s face that lit up even more. Surprised it actually worked, Tom let out a triumphant \u201cAlriiiiight!\u201d He paused to look around the room, joking he could now see its messy contents. \u201cWow, that\u2019s neat,\u201d Tom added. \u201cI\u2019ve seen electricity before but not in my own property.\u201d Now, he looks forward to installing an air conditioning unit.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/navajo-nation-power-grid-connection/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_us_nashville-school-shooter-writings", "text": "The writings of the person who\u00a0killed three 9-year-olds and three adults\u00a0at a private Christian elementary school in Nashville last year cannot be released to the public, a judge ruled Thursday. Chancery Court Judge I\u2019Ashea Myles found that The Covenant School children and parents hold the copyright to any writings or other works created by shooter Audrey Hale, a former student who was killed by police. Hale\u2019s parents inherited the works and then transferred ownership to the families. Myles ruled that \u201cthe original writings, journals, art, photos and videos created by Hale\u201d are subject to an exception to the Tennessee Public Records Act created by the federal Copyright Act. The ruling comes more than a year after several groups filed public records requests for documents seized by Metro Nashville Police during their investigation into the\u00a0March 2023 shooting. The shooter left behind at least 20 journals, a suicide note and a memoir, according to court filings. When the records requests were denied, several parties sued, and the situation quickly ballooned into a messy mix of conspiracy theories,\u00a0leaked documents, probate battles and\u00a0accusations of ethical misconduct. Myles\u2019 order will almost surely be appealed. After the initial records requests last year, police said they would eventually release the documents but could not do so right away because their investigation was still open. The groups suing for the immediate release of the records \u2014 including news outlets, a gun rights group, a law enforcement nonprofit and Tennessee state Sen. Todd Gardenhire \u2014 argued that there was no meaningful criminal investigation underway since Hale, who police say acted alone, was dead. Meanwhile, a group of Covenant parents was allowed to intervene in the case and argue that the records should never become public. They said the release would be traumatic for the families and could inspire copycat attacks. As part of the effort to keep the records closed, Hale\u2019s parents transferred ownership of Hale\u2019s property to the parents\u2019 group. Attorneys for the parents then argued they owned the copyright, further reason the records could not be released. Also intervening in the case were The Covenant School and the Covenant Presbyterian Church, which shares a building. They argued the records should remain closed because their release could threaten their security. Part of the interest in the records stems from the fact that Hale, who police say was \u201cassigned female at birth,\u201d may have identified as a transgender man. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, of Missouri, is among those who have promoted a theory that the shooting was a hate crime against Christians. The delay in releasing the writings fueled speculation \u2014 particularly in conservative circles \u2014 over what they might contain and conspiracy theories about why police wouldn\u2019t immediately release them. As the court case has dragged on, pages from one journal were\u00a0leaked to a conservative commentator\u00a0who posted them to social media in November. More recently, The Tennessee Star\u00a0published dozens of stories\u00a0based on allegedly 80 pages of Hale\u2019s writings provided by an unnamed source. The publication is among the plaintiffs, and Myles briefly threatened to hold the paper\u2019s editor-in-chief, Michael Leahy, and owner, Star News Digital Media, in contempt.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/us/nashville-school-shooter-writings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_03_us_mass-shootings-fourth-july-fbi-tips", "text": "Mass shooters generally don\u2019t just snap. Instead, they plot. And many outwardly display troubling signs along their pathway to violence. That assessment from the renowned profilers at the FBI\u2019s behavioral analysis units underpins a new effort by the bureau\u00a0to inform the public of key warning signs ahead of gatherings for the Fourth of July \u2013 a holiday period that researchers say tends to feature an increase in mass shootings. The FBI says that if people report seeing threat indicators that would-be shooters typically exhibit, they may very well prevent a massacre. What are the warning signs? \u201cYou have someone who may be more fixated on violence, maybe obsessively focusing on violent fantasies or ways to resolve their different challenges,\u201d said Karie Gibson, who leads one of the FBI\u2019s behavioral analysis units and holds a doctorate in psychology. \u201cThey may actually record or write a manifesto or an actual video or suicide note, to really want to take credit for this plan they are preparing to do.\u201d Noticeable shifts in behavior are also key. \u201cYou have somebody who, at one time in their life, was functioning in a way where they were handling the stress, and now we\u2019re seeing marked changes to that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that they have changes in their school performance or work performance; we\u2019re seeing that they are not participating in hobbies or areas of activities.\u201d For certain people, the \u201cpathway to violence, a lot of times, will begin with a grievance,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cIt can be a slight, it can be an injustice, it can be a wrong that has happened to them \u2013 it can be real or perceived.\u201d No single factor guarantees someone might commit a shooting, but when several concerning characteristics begin to manifest, it could be time to seek help, either from law enforcement, a principal or a supervisor, she said. \u2018Our best hope\u2019 \u201cFriends, family, teachers, classmates, workmates, and others similarly situated are our best hope,\u201d Katherine Schweit, mass shooting expert and former FBI executive, wrote in her book \u201cStop the Killing.\u201d These people often are best placed to pick up a phone and report concerns \u2013 but to make the correct move they may have to push themselves past any notion that they\u2019re not the ones who need to do it, Schweit warned. For example, she wrote, teachers may simply try to wait out a concerning student and pass them to the next grade. Parents ill-equipped to handle a struggling child may try to pass them off to another relative. Schweit wrote that those closest to a possible mass shooter might become desensitized to concerning conduct or may refuse to believe the end result could be an attack, but notes speaking up is critical to saving lives. \u201cWe have to accept a willingness to understand that what we see and hear may be a pattern of behaviors that might lead a person to act out violently,\u201d she wrote. \u2018Our worst week for shootings\u2019 Law enforcement statistics and independent researchers have continually pointed to summer months as a time of increased gun violence in the US. An especially violent period each year for both mass shootings and individual incidents: July 1-7. \u201cThat is always our worst week for shootings,\u201d said Mark Bryant, executive director of the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit that tracks gun deaths and injuries across America. Both CNN and the Gun Violence Archive define a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are shot, not including the shooter. July 4 itself accounted for more US mass shootings than any other single calendar day over roughly a decade, a 2023 CNN analysis of the Gun Violence Archive\u2019s mass shooting data since 2014 found. The day with the second most number of shootings was the day after \u2013 July 5. Over the past three years, 77 mass shootings happened collectively during the first week of July, Bryant said. \u201cThere are so many people in large groups during that period of time and it\u2019s usually extremely hot,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find a difference in an area that is 95 degrees versus a place that is 65 degrees.\u201d That impact of heat on the rate of gun violence has been studied by academic researchers, who have noted how higher temperatures\u00a0can result in increased anger, agitation, and hostility. Other possible factors responsible for an uptick in violence around Independence Day include the consumption of alcohol at gatherings and the sheer number of guns now available in the US, which has often resulted in people attempting to settle disputes with firearms. Bryant says the odds are, \u201cwhen one gun comes out, other guns come out.\u201d More than \u2018mental illness\u2019 Although the FBI\u2019s behavioral analysts have long helped law enforcement agencies across the country prevent and solve crimes, the bureau ramped up its proactive approach to curbing gun deaths in 2018 following deadly mass shootings in Las Vegas and at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Gibson said. That effort included building and supporting more than 150 federal, state, and local law enforcement threat assessment teams across the US to help stop the next mass shooter. As the initiative has progressed, the FBI has evolved to not just sharing information with law enforcement, but more proactively educating the public about the agency\u2019s behavioral research findings and warning signs. While a spate of mass killings in recent years has placed greater emphasis on the impact of mental health in driving certain acts of violence, a key finding of the FBI\u2019s examinations of active shooters across the nation has dispelled notions that all shooters are mentally ill, versus those individuals unable to handle the stresses of life, Gibson said. \u201cThis is lending towards really looking at how someone is coping with stress, how someone is managing their life when they\u2019re struggling,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cLet\u2019s help them, let\u2019s help get interventions, because it\u2019s more about that mental wellness issue that they\u2019re struggling with versus an actual mental illness.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/mass-shootings-fourth-july-fbi-tips/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "us"}}

The suspect, who authorities identified as Billy Booth of Crete, was found dead Friday evening\u00a0from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a nearby home,\u00a0authorities said. \u201cAt approximately 4:33 p.m. Friday, Saline County 911 received multiple reports of an active shooter incident occurring in the 1200 block of Crestline Drive in Crete,\u201d a Saturday\u00a0news release\u00a0from Nebraska State Patrol (NSP) read. When\u00a0approaching, officers\u00a0said\u00a0they could\u00a0\u201chear gunfire still occurring.\u201d \u201cThey located several victims inside a home on Crestline Drive and identified that the gunfire was coming from a house across the street,\u201d the release read.\u00a0The statement also notes\u00a0\u201cthere were approximately 15 people at the victims\u2019 residence at the time of the shooting.\u201d \u201cOfficers and the first EMTs on scene evacuated the victims to safety so they could be transported for treatment,\u201d the release read. \u201cIn total, there were seven gunshot victims.\u201d Four children were\u00a0injured in the\u00a0shooting, ranging from ages 3 to 10, and three adults were also injured, ranging from ages 22 to 43, NSP said. The NSP told CNN Tuesday that the victims were all Guatemalan and that they have all been released from area hospitals. A SWAT team was activated, and\u00a0\u201cat approximately 6:40\u00a0pm\u2026 made entry into the home where the gunfire had originated, 1810 Parkland Street, and located the occupant\u00a0deceased from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The SWAT team located a shotgun near the suspect,\u201d\u00a0according to NSP. In a Saturday\u00a0news conference,\u00a0Colonel John A. Bolduc, Superintendent of the Nebraska State Patrol, said\u00a0that authorities do not believe there was\u00a0\u201cany\u00a0verbal contact between the suspect and any of the victims\u00a0in the moments that led up to the shooting.\u201d However, there had been a \u201cprior history between the suspect\u201d and some of the victims\u2019 families,\u00a0he noted. Crete Police Chief\u00a0Gary Young Jr. said at\u00a0the news conference authorities had previous\u00a0contact with the suspect as they had responded to \u201cseveral complaints since 2021\u201d\u00a0that he made. \u201cMost of them dealt with driving behavior,\u00a0not necessarily associated with the victims\u2019 house,\u00a0but cars driving too fast in the neighborhood, improper parking, nuisance properties, quality of life type issues,\u201d Young Jr. said, adding that the suspect complained \u201cgenerally about the neighborhood.\u201d Earlier this year, there was a \u201csingle report from the victims that the suspect had flipped them off, told them \u2018to go home\u2019 or \u2018back to where they came from,\u2019 and \u2018speak English.\u2019\u201d Young Jr. said at the time\u00a0the responding officer interviewed the family and the suspect, and the officer was\u00a0\u201cwilling to take it for prosecution\u2014the family declined.\u201d Based on interviews with the family Friday, Young Jr. said,\u00a0\u201cMy understanding is that additional contacts were made between the suspect and the family, and the family told them\u00a0that they would contact the police and that resolved the situation, so we had no further contact.\u201d When asked\u00a0if authorities believe there is a \u201cracial\u00a0component\u201d to the prior complaints Young Jr.\u00a0said\u00a0\u201cthere could be.\u00a0We don\u2019t know.

A 26-year-old man was bitten by a shark off New Smyrna Beach, Florida, on Friday, the second shark bite reported on the Florida beach during the Independence Day holiday week.

In Texas, four people encountered a shark as they took to the waters off South Padre Island on the Independence Day holiday. \u201cDetails at this time indicate that two people were bitten and two people encountered the shark but were not seriously injured,\u201d the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department said in a statement. The two bite victims were taken to Valley Regional Medical Center in Brownsville, where one is being treated and the other has been flown out for further treatment, the department said. The third person was injured \u2013 but not seriously \u2013 while trying to assist one of the bite victims, the department told CNN. It is unclear exactly how they were hurt. Another beachgoer said they felt a shark brush against them as it swam by, the department said. \u201cShark encounters of this nature are not a common occurrence in Texas,\u201d the statement noted. \u201cWhen bites from sharks do occur, they are usually a case of mistaken identity by sharks looking for food.\u201d Earlier, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Game Warden Captain Chris Dowdy told CNN affiliate KRGV at least four shark-related incidents had been reported at South Padre Island. The attacks were likely associated with the same shark, which later swam to open waters, he said. Two off-duty Border Patrol agents from the Search, Trauma and Rescue Unit pulled one of the victims out of the water and applied a tourniquet to their leg, according to a US Customs and Border Protection official. \u201cOur hearts and prayers are with the injured and their families, and we hope for a speedy recovery,\u201d South Padre Island Mayor Patrick McNulty said. One of the attacks was reported to the South Padre Island Police Department at 11 a.m., the city\u2019s Public Information Officer Nikki Soto told CNN. Officers provided immediate treatment and transported the male victim to a hospital, Soto said. South Padre Island Beach authorities have been patrolling the shoreline and using drones to watch for the shark, she said. Nereyda Bazaldua told CNN her daughter was one of those bitten Thursday. Bazaldua said her two teenage daughters were in shallow, knee-deep water near the shore playing on boogie boards when they began screaming, \u201cShark!\u201d When her 18-year-old daughter Victoria came out of the water, Bazaldua said she \u201ccould see some blood coming down her leg,\u201d Bazaldua said. Thankfully, she said, Victoria\u2019s injuries were minor. \u201cThe shark pushed into her, five to six of his teeth scratched her leg,\u201d Bazaldua said. \u201cThe wounds aren\u2019t deep.\u201d She said the shark lingered in the water for 20 to 30 minutes before moving along. \u201cWe never saw the shark \u2018til he was right there with them,\u201d Balzadua said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t choppy water, and the seas were calm. He showed up out of nowhere.\u201d A Texas Department of Public Safety helicopter flew low over South Padre Island and used deterrence measures to keep the shark from getting close to shore after the encounters, a spokesperson said. \u201cThe Texas Department of Public Safety\u2019s Aircraft Division responded to South Padre Island to assist local authorities with a shark attack,\u201d Lt. Chris Olivarez said. Olivarez shared with CNN video taken from the helicopter that showed a shark lurking in the waters and swimming against the waves Thursday afternoon. \u201cDPS remained on scene until the shark was no longer a threat,\u201d Olivarez said. According to the International Shark Attack File, run out of the University of Florida, there have been fewer than 10 shark bites reported in Texas since 2012. This places the Lone Star State behind Florida, which has had 259 reported bites; Hawaii, which has had 76; South Carolina, which has had 45; North Carolina, which has had 31; and California, which has had 29. South Padre Island is about 100 miles from Padre Island National Seashore, at the opposite end of what used to be one continuous island, according to the National Park Service. Padre Island (also known as North Padre Island) is the longest stretch of undeveloped barrier island in the world, with 70 miles of protected coastline, the park service said. It divides the Gulf of Mexico from the Laguna Madre.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/us/south-padre-island-shark-bites/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "us"}}

Mark Warner to get Senate Democrats on the same page about the future of President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection bid, sources told CNN, putting further pressure on the White House as it struggles to handle questions about the president\u2019s mental fitness and the viability of his campaign. Warner, who is taking on a leadership role in the effort, is reaching a place where he thinks it is time for Biden to suspend his reelection campaign, a source familiar with his efforts told CNN. The Biden administration and campaign have grappled in recent days with how to spin the president\u2019s poor debate performance, offering contradicting excuses and making the argument that Biden\u2019s record in the past three years is more significant than his shaky 90-minute standoff with former President Donald Trump. However, the debate only exacerbated concerns about the president\u2019s health and questions on whether he is fit to serve another four years in office. As pressure has increased within the party, some Democrats have\u00a0urged the president to consider\u00a0whether he is the party\u2019s best chance at beating Trump in November, while others have gone as far as to call for him to step aside as their presumptive nominee. Warner\u2019s meeting with his colleagues, first reported by\u00a0The Washington Post, is expected to take place Monday, according to a source familiar with the planning. Biden responded to reports of Warner\u2019s efforts on Friday, telling ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos in an interview that \u201cMark is a good man\u201d but he has a \u201cdifferent perspective.\u201d \u201cWell, Mark is a good man. We\u2019ve never had that. He also tried to get the nomination too. Mark\u2019s not, Mark and I have a different perspective. I respect him,\u201d he said without elaborating, adding that members of Democratic congressional leadership have told him to \u201cstay in the race.\u201d Warner declined CNN\u2019s request for comment. His spokeswoman, Rachel Cohen, neither confirmed nor denied the senator\u2019s efforts in a statement to the Post earlier Friday, saying: \u201cLike many other people in Washington and across the country, Senator Warner believes these are critical days for the president\u2019s campaign, and he has made that clear to the White House.\u201d Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is summoning his members to a virtual meeting Sunday\u00a0with\u00a0Democratic committee ranking members,\u00a0which is expected to focus on Biden, a Democratic lawmaker told CNN. Jeffries\u2019 meeting was first reported by\u00a0NBC News. Biden privately told an ally earlier this week that the next stretch of days is critical to whether he can save his reelection bid. But the president remained defiant Friday, telling reporters before boarding Air Force One following a campaign rally in Wisconsin that he is \u201ccompletely ruling out\u201d getting out of the 2024 race.

{"id": "2024_07_05_business_saks-fifth-avenue-neiman-marcus-amazon", "text": "Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus are merging to create a luxury department store empire. And Amazon wants to help. Saks owner HBC announced a deal Thursday to acquire Neiman Marcus for $2.65 billion, establishing a luxury behemoth called Saks Global that has the two namesake department stores plus Saks Off 5th discount store and the upscale Bergdorf Goodman. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to take this step in bringing together these iconic luxury names, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman,\u201d said HBC CEO Richard Baker in a release. The two companies have been linked to merger talks for years, and the deal gives them more leverage to negotiate with luxury brands for lower costs. Saks has 39 stores, while Neiman Marcus, which filed for bankruptcy in 2020, has 36 stores. Neiman Marcus also owns Bergdorf Goodman. Several leadership changes were also announced. Current Saks.com CEO Marc Metrick will become the CEO for the Saks Global business. Current HBC Properties and Investments CEO Ian Putnam will become CEO of Saks Global\u2019s property and investments business. Both of them will report to Baker, who becomes the executive chairman of Saks Global. The merger means that HBC\u2019s Canadian business, which includes Hudson\u2019s Bay department stores and $2 billion in property across the country, will operate separately from Saks Global. The unit \u201cwill be well positioned to support future growth, while continuing to serve its loyal Canadian base,\u201d the release said. The chains are responding to industry shifts, including the decline of department stores, and the growing power of luxury brands. Brands such as Louis Vuitton parent LVMH are getting bigger and shifting their distribution strategy to direct-to-consumer sales, away from department stores. The planned Saks-Neiman Marcus merger seeks to wrest back some control. It also comes on the heels of Coach parent Tapestry\u2019s proposal to buy Michael Kors owner Capri. \u201cAs a larger entity, negotiating power will be a little better with the brands, but even a combined chain would not match the heft and power of the global luxury conglomerates, which would still hold most of the card,\u201d Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients Wednesday. Saks\u2019 deal could face regulatory scrutiny, however. The Federal Trade Commission sued to block Tapestry\u2019s merger with Capri, saying it would harm competition. \u201cThe proposed merger threatens to deprive millions of American consumers of the benefits of Tapestry and\u00a0Capri\u2019s head-to-head competition, which includes competition on price, discounts and promotions, innovation, design,\u00a0marketing and advertising,\u201d the FTC said. Amazon also is investing in the merger, working with Saks Global to \u201cinnovate on behalf of customers and brands partners following the close of the transaction,\u201d the release said. Amazon has tried to grow in physical retail. In 2022, it opened Amazon Style clothing stores in Glendale, California, and Columbus, Ohio, but closed them last year. Saunders added that Amazon\u2019s stake does \u201cmake sense, as it has ambitions to play more heavily in the luxury space and this would give it a toehold.\u201d \u201cHowever, the real win here would be the ability of Amazon to streamline logistics and e-commerce, giving the new entity an advantage in a market where remote shopping has become more important to shoppers \u2014 especially younger ones, which both chains need to do more to attract,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/business/saks-fifth-avenue-neiman-marcus-amazon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_us_kansas-school-district-justice-department-settlement", "text": "The largest public school district in Kansas has agreed to revise its disciplinary practices as part of a settlement with the US Justice Department, resolving a federal civil rights investigation that determined its educators engaged in a pattern of discrimination against Black and disabled students. As part of the settlement agreement, which the Justice Department announced Tuesday, the Wichita Public Schools district will implement changes to end its use of seclusion, reform its restraint practices and refrain from referring students to law enforcement while dealing with routine school discipline matters, the department said in a news release. Black students in the district faced harsher, more severe disciplinary action than White students who engaged in \u201csimilar conduct and had similar backgrounds and disciplinary histories,\u201d the agency found. Insubordination was the most common offense for which the district disciplined Black students at a higher rate. The agency called the pattern \u201cespecially stark\u201d when it came to disciplining Black girls, whose behavior was \u201crepeatedly characterized using stereotypical terms like \u2018attitude\u2019 or \u2018drama,\u2019\u201d the release said. Black girls were also frequently and unnecessarily excluded from the school environment for \u201cperceived insubordination\u201d as well as dress code violations at some middle schools, the agreement said. During the period covered by the investigation, students with disabilities were subjected to 98% of the district\u2019s roughly 3,000 restraints and seclusions, and at least 44 students received 20 or more, the release said; one student was restrained or secluded at least 144 times, including 99 seclusions that lasted over 15 hours. Investigators visited the district\u2019s special schools for students with behavioral disabilities and discovered \u201cinferior facilities devoid of furniture, educational equipment and the kinds of decor commonly found in schools, and staff who could not meet the needs of students,\u201d the release stated. By the start of the next school year this fall, the district is required to create an Office of Behavior Management Support and Oversight to monitor restraint practices, ensuring compliance with the agreement, the settlement document says. As part of the new policy, educators can only restrain students when they pose an imminent danger of serious physical harm to themselves or others, it said. The district must also write a new code of conduct policy that will \u201cstandardize dress code policies and create a behavior intervention protocol\u201d to prevent discrimination in disciplining students, among other measures, the department said. It will provide counseling, as well as compensatory education to students who experienced repeated seclusion, according to the agreement. Nationally, Black students experience more restraints and seclusions At a Tuesday news conference, Kelly Bielefeld, the school district\u2019s superintendent, said the investigation started in spring 2022, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what may have prompted the initial inquiry, but I can tell you that we can, and we must create a more equitable school district.\u201d The Justice Department has conducted similar investigations into school districts across the nation, including one completed in 2021 that revealed Black and Asian American Students at the Davis School District in Utah were harassed for years and officials deliberately ignored complaints from parents and students. The department\u2019s Educational Opportunities Section, part of its civil rights division, has been investigating and resolving complaints of improper seclusion of students with disabilities in public schools. According to a 2023\u00a0report\u00a0from the US Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, \u201capproximately 52,800 K-12 students were physically restrained, mechanically restrained, and/or placed in seclusion at schools,\u201d during the 2020-2021 school year. While Black students made up 15% of K-12 public school enrollment during the same year, the report found they accounted for 21% of students physically restrained, 42% of the students restrained using a device or equipment, and 19% of students secluded. Boys, Black students, students of two or more races and students with disabilities were also more likely to be restrained,\u00a0the report said. \u201cBlack students inside our nation\u2019s public schools should not have to face discipline or a referral to law enforcement because of their race. And students with disabilities should not have to experience the trauma of seclusion or improper restraint,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Kristen Clarke. \u201cSchools in our communities should not be a place of fear or mistrust.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chandelis Duster and Nia Mclean contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/kansas-school-district-justice-department-settlement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_us_blaze-bernstein-killing-conviction", "text": "A California man was convicted of murder with a hate crime enhancement Wednesday for the 2018 stabbing death of a gay University of Pennsylvania student. Samuel Woodward, 26, was found guilty of first-degree murder plus the enhancement in the killing of Blaze Bernstein, a gay, Jewish college sophomore who was home visiting his family in Southern California on winter break when he went missing. Authorities scoured the area for him and found his body a week later in a shallow grave at a nearby park. The question during the monthslong trial was not whether Woodward killed Bernstein but why, and the circumstances under which it happened. During closing arguments, prosecutor Jennifer Walker emphasized Woodward\u2019s affiliation with a violent, anti-gay, neo-Nazi extremist group known as Atomwaffen Division. \u201cThis is a person focused on hate,\u201d Walker said. \u201cNot following, not being led by, influenced by, victimized by Atomwaffen \u2014 seeking it out.\u201d With the hate crime enhancement, Woodward could face a sentence of life without parole. Ken Morrison, Woodward\u2019s attorney, sought at trial to show his client did not plan to kill Bernstein and did not hate anyone, in an effort for a conviction to be on a lesser charge such as second-degree murder or manslaughter. Morrison, who plans to appeal after sentencing, said the judge made some key rulings that denied \u201cjurors the ability to consider evidence critical to a fair trial.\u201d Bernstein\u2019s family said in a statement no verdict could \u201cerase the pain of losing our son and the agony of waiting all of these years without resolution,\u201d ABC News reported. \u201cHe was an amazing human and humanitarian and a person we were greatly looking forward to having in our lives, seeing wondrous things from him as his young life unfolded,\u201d the family said. \u201cFrom this funny, articulate, kind, intelligent, caring and brilliant scientist, artist, writer, chef and son, there will never be anyone quite like him.\u201d Woodward and Bernstein previously attended the same high school in Orange County and connected via a dating app in the months before the attack, according to testimony at trial. Woodward said he picked up Bernstein and went to a nearby park, and he repeatedly stabbed Bernstein after trying to grab a cellphone he feared had been used to photograph him. Prosecutors said Woodward joined Atomwaffen Division and repeatedly targeted gay men online by reaching out to them and then abruptly breaking off contact while keeping a hateful, profanity-laced journal of his actions. They said Woodward showed an interest in carrying out violent acts in the weeks before the killing and reached out to Bernstein online. \u201cHate will never be tolerated here in Orange County \u2014 and instead of a symbol to be revered by other haters, he is a symbol of how society will never tolerate those who terrorize the most vulnerable members of our society,\u201d county District Attorney Todd Spitzer said Wednesday in a statement. Morrison, the defense lawyer, told jurors Woodward faced challenges in his personal relationships due to a long-undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder and was confused about his sexuality after growing up in a politically conservative and devout Catholic family where his father openly criticized homosexuality. The case took years to go to trial after questions arose about Woodward\u2019s mental state and following multiple changes in defense attorneys. Woodward was deemed competent to stand trial in late 2022. Bernstein, who was 19 at the time, disappeared in January 2018 after he went out at night with Woodward to a park in Lake Forest, about 45 miles southeast of Los Angeles. After Bernstein missed a dentist appointment the next day, his parents found his glasses, wallet and credit cards in his bedroom and tried to contact him, but he did not respond to texts or calls. Authorities launched an exhaustive search and said Bernstein\u2019s family scoured his social media and saw he had communicated with Woodward on Snapchat. Authorities said Woodward told the family Bernstein had gone off to meet a friend in the park that night and did not return. Days later, Bernstein\u2019s body was found\u00a0in the shallow grave. He had been repeatedly stabbed in the face and neck. Authorities said they searched Woodward\u2019s family home in Newport Beach and found a folding knife with a bloodied blade in his room. They also found a black Atomwaffen mask with traces of blood and a host of anti-gay, antisemitic and hate group materials, prosecutors said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/us/blaze-bernstein-killing-conviction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_02_us_leonard-peltier-denied-parole-fbi-killings", "text": "Leonard Peltier, the Indigenous activist convicted of the 1975 murders of two FBI agents, has been denied parole from federal prison, his attorney told CNN on Tuesday. Peltier, 79, has long maintained his innocence in the shooting deaths of agents Ronald A. Williams and Jack R. Coler. Peltier\u2019s legal team says they plan to appeal the parole board\u2019s decision. Coler and Williams were killed in a shootout June 26, 1975, while searching for a robbery suspect on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. In 1977, Peltier was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to two consecutive life terms, though he denied shooting Coler and Williams. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill those agents, I didn\u2019t see who killed those agents, and if I did know, I\u2019m not telling. But I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s the point,\u201d Peltier told CNN correspondent Mark Potter in 1999. Peltier said he fired shots during the gunbattle but \u201cI know I didn\u2019t hit them. I know I didn\u2019t.\u201d The government built its case on ballistics evidence and witness accounts from people who were on the periphery of the shootout, including Native Americans, but no one actually saw the killings. As a leader of the American Indian Movement in the 70s, Peltier\u2019s conviction has long been polarizing. He has been denied parole before \u2013 in 2009, according to The Associated Press, and in 2017, President Barack Obama denied his clemency request. During Peltier\u2019s parole hearing last month, his failing health, age and nonviolent record during his nearly 50 years in prison were all highlighted. Peltier won\u2019t be eligible for another parole hearing until June 2026, a US Parole Commission spokesperson said. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement continues the injustice of this long ordeal for Leonard Peltier,\u201d Peltier\u2019s attorney, Kevin Sharp, said in a statement. \u201cThis decision is a missed opportunity for the United States to finally recognize the misconduct of the FBI and send a message to Indian Country regarding the impacts of the federal government\u2019s actions and policies of the 1970\u2019s.\u201d FBI Director Christopher Wray said the bureau is pleased the US Parole Commission \u201ccontinued to side with the facts.\u201d \u201cNo amount of prison time will ever change the facts\u00a0surrounding the murders of FBI Special Agents Coler and Williams,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cMr. Peltier has been afforded his rights and due process time and again, and repeatedly, the weight of the evidence has supported his conviction and his life sentence.\u201d Supporters of Peltier have said the evidence, including ballistics, produced at trial was unreliable; the FBI has categorically denied it fabricated evidence or coerced witnesses. Lynn Crooks, a prosecutor at Peltier\u2019s 1977 double-murder trial, told CNN in 1999 that they proved Peltier was a participant in the killings. \u201cWhoever was down there was essentially down there under the influence of Leonard\u00a0Peltier,\u201d he said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t down there to give aid and comfort to these two injured, dying men. They\u2019re down there to execute them, and that\u2019s exactly what they did.\u201d Peltier told CNN he was in bed at camp when he heard gunshots. \u201cAll of a sudden everybody said, \u2018Man, we\u2019re being attacked. We\u2019re being attacked,\u2019\u201d he said in 1999. \u201cI says, \u2018Oh, my God.\u2019 So I grabbed an old rifle and started running up to the house.\u201d He said he fired his gun after being fired upon. The FBI has said the agents were shot without provocation. The FBI Agents Association applauded the parole board\u2019s decision Tuesday, saying it \u201cupholds justice for our fallen colleagues and their families.\u201d \u201cThe FBIAA reaffirms its commitment to honoring the memory of Agents Coler and Williams, and Peltier\u2019s continued incarceration is necessary to ensure public safety and respect for the law,\u201d the association said in the statement. Nick Tilsen, president of Indigenous activist group NDN Collective, said, \u201cToday is a sad day for Indigenous Peoples and justice everywhere. The U.S. Parole Commission\u2019s denial of parole for Leonard Peltier, America\u2019s longest serving Indigenous political prisoner, is a travesty.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/us/leonard-peltier-denied-parole-fbi-killings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "us"}}

Asia\u2019s richest family has also shown off its wealth with a display of jewels evoking the long-gone era of maharajahs and Mughal emperors. The Ambanis have set a new benchmark for big, fat Indian weddings, which are bound to grow bigger and louder than ever before as the number of the ultra-rich swells in the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy. \u201cThe Ambani wedding parties have \u2026 had a multi-faceted impact on the wedding industry in India, influencing trends, boosting demand for wedding vendors, promoting cultural heritage and even driving economic growth,\u201d Tim Chi, CEO of The Knot Worldwide,\u00a0a wedding planning service,\u00a0told CNN. The Indian wedding industry has boomed since the country emerged from the pandemic. Estimated at about $130 billion, it\u2019s now nearly twice the size of America\u2019s, although still smaller than that of China\u2019s, according to a report by Jefferies last month. \u201cAn otherwise value-conscious society, Indians love to spend on weddings,\u201d Jefferies said. \u201cAnd this is irrespective of the economic classes.\u201d At about $15,000, the average Indian wedding costs more than\u00a0three\u00a0times the average annual household income. More than a status symbol Weddings can be expensive affairs in any country, but in India they are especially important as symbols of power and status. Parents in South Asia typically spend a significant portion of their lifetime savings on their children\u2019s weddings, but the scale of many of these events has now become gargantuan, coinciding with India\u2019s rise as an economic powerhouse. \u201cIn the last decade there has been a big shift in Indian weddings across the board,\u201d said Sima Taparia, a\u00a0marriage consultant\u00a0who became a household name in the country after starring in the hit Netflix docuseries \u201cIndian Matchmaking.\u201d It is now common for wealthy Indians to host big weddings at exotic destinations abroad and invite Bollywood actors or famous musicians to perform, she added. \u201cThe Indian wedding is about the power of contacts, the power of relationships and the power of wealth,\u201d said Aditya Motwane, an events planner who founded Motwane Entertainment & Weddings and worked on the wedding of actress Priyanka Chopra\u00a0and singer Nick Jonas\u00a0in 2018. \u201cYou show everyone you know that you\u2019ve arrived in life through these kinds of celebrations,\u201d he added. Indian weddings are often spread across several days, with an average guest list of 326, compared with 115 in the United States, according to The Knot Worldwide. The scale is exponentially\u00a0bigger when it comes to the affluent, whose weddings involve thousands of guests, foreign locations and expensive gifts. Ambani\u2019s\u00a0three-day pre-wedding party in the western Indian city of Jamnagar in March was\u00a0attended by around 1,200 high-profile guests, including Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates. It is not uncommon for the very wealthy to spend many millions on the festivities. At the Ambani party, an elaborate light show featuring 5,500 drones lit up the sky above a glass palace custom-built for the festivities, where guests danced to a performance by none other than Rihanna. The outrageously rich also come up with some unusual requests. One couple asked Motwane to arrange for an elephant \u2014 a sacred animal to Hindus \u2014 to be in Monte Carlo to bless them. With India set to become the world\u2019s third-largest economy by 2027, extravagant weddings are expected to become even more frequent. According to a report from real estate consultancy Knight Frank, the number of Indians with a net worth of at least $30 million will rise by 50% over the five years to 2028, the biggest increase of any country. And, lower down the economic ladder, by 2030 some 600 million Indians are projected to be middle-class, a segment that will represent over 80% of the country\u2019s spending power. \u201cAs the middle class grows, so does their disposable income, which inevitably is spent on lavish parties and celebrations,\u201d said Tina Tharwani, co-founder of wedding planning company Shaadi Squad. Rihanna, couture and emeralds The average luxury Indian wedding can cost anywhere between $200,000 and $400,000, according to Jefferies. This kind of budget allows for accommodation at five-star hotels across the world, sumptuous catering, decor and entertainment, and sometimes includes Bollywood actors or international singers. But the Jefferies cost estimate does not include expenses on jewelry or attire. Bridal spending accounts for over half of the total jewelry market it India, the bank noted. The country is one of the largest markets for gold, but its appetite for diamonds and other precious gems is also growing. The emerald necklace worn by Nita Ambani, the groom\u2019s mother, at the festivities in March stunned the internet with its size and sparkle. No luxury Indian wedding\u00a0is complete without\u00a0lavish meals, which at times involves flying in Michelin star chefs and the finest of ingredients from across the world. An extra layer of expense is often added to the budget because many Indians don\u2019t eat meat, and some avoid root vegetables as well. Motwane recalls planning a wedding in Florence where many guests did not eat garlic or onion. The Italian cooks \u201chit the roof,\u201d he said. A renowned Indian Italian chef and her team were then flown in. A range of other businesses are poised for growth as Ambani-style high-profile weddings lead to a \u201ctrickle-down effect,\u201d setting \u201cnew trends and standards (and) influencing couples\u2019 expectations,\u201d said Tharwani, who worked on Indian cricketer\u00a0Virat Kohli\u2019s wedding in Tuscany. Vanessa Almeida, who looked after packaging and delivery of some 8,000 gifts for Ambani\u2019s guests at the jamboree in March, told CNN that similar party favors are becoming sought-after across the country. Of the many expensive\u00a0presents that the family showered upon its A-list guests \u2014 from silver candle sticks and shawls to\u00a0terrariums and bird houses \u2014 customized leather products\u00a0are among those that have caught on, said Almeida, owner of The Gift House in Goa. Demand for wedding videographers has also boomed in the last decade, with companies charging as much as $10,000 for a film. Many couples also shoot pre-wedding videos, which are painstakingly choreographed and\u00a0inspired by Bollywood musicals. \u201cBrides and grooms go for pre-wedding shoots across the globe,\u201d said Taparia. Local economy The rise in opulent celebrations held abroad has led to some consternation among the local communities, wedding planners say. In late May, the Ambanis held a four-day Mediterranean cruise for friends and family, with a bevy of Bollywood stars and performances by Katy Perry, the Backstreet Boys and Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli. Not everyone was impressed. The partygoers drew the ire of residents in the port city of Genoa, according to media reports, as they kept several neighborhoods awake with loud music until dawn. But, despite the occasional inconvenience, such functions also generate revenue and employment in the area. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a minimum of 2-3 million euros coming in over three days,\u201d said Motwane. The Indian government is now trying to get a bigger chunk of the luxury wedding revenue, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi launching a \u201cWed in India\u201d campaign to encourage affluent families to get married in the country. \u201cPeople often spend significant amounts of money to get married abroad,\u201d Modi said in March. But by hosting weddings in India, \u201cfamilies can enjoy lavish celebrations for three to four days, providing livelihood opportunities for locals.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/business/ultra-rich-indian-weddings-economy-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "us"}}

Foster County Emergency Management Director Andrew Kirking told CNN 911 was notified about the train derailment in the small town of Bordulac \u2013 about 140 miles northeast of Fargo \u2013 between 3:30 a.m. and 4 a.m. local time. Kirking said the train was carrying \u201cintact hazardous materials,\u201d so authorities have been monitoring air quality near the incident. Between 25 and 30 cars derailed. The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality told CNN the train was carrying anhydrous ammonia, sulfur and methanol. Anhydrous ammonia, a gas widely used as a nitrogen-based fertilizer, can be extremely dangerous in high quantities, triggering explosions and causing dehydration and severe burns in humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In a\u00a0Facebook post, the DEQ said they are monitoring the remediation and cleanup of the derailment. CNN has contacted Canadian Pacific, the train operator, for comment. Kirking added that local crews, including Carrington Fire, regional hazardous material officials and Canadian Pacific also responded to the scene. The emergency management director told CNN that crews are trying to bridge a gap over a bog to fight the fires and get heavy equipment to move the train cars. \u201cOur objective is to get the fire out in the next 12 to 18 hours,\u201d Kirking said. \u201cWe are starting to get a little water on it right now.\u201d Kirking said getting the train cars removed will be a bit more tedious and will likely take more than a week or two. He said all residents within a one-mile radius of the derailment were notified of the incident and potential hazards. Consequently, Kirking said, they have issued a voluntary evacuation. The cause of the derailment is still under investigation, he said, adding that the engineer and conductor were the only people onboard the train and they escaped safely. Kirking said it\u2019s a little too early to tell if the hazardous material has leaked into any waterways, but an environmental group is coming out to set up to prevent any pollution. \u201cRight now based on the elevation, we think that the spill material can be contained around those railroad tracks and will not impact any water source,\u201d Kirking said. In a\u00a0post on X, the National Transportation Safety Board said they are investigating the derailment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/us/north-dakota-train-derailment/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "us"}}

{"id": "2024_07_05_business_japan-aging-society-baby-care-nhk-dg", "text": "The world\u2019s population is getting older in what the United Nations calls an \u201cirreversible global trend,\u201d driven by longer lives and smaller families. The number of people aged 65 and older is expected to more than double to 1.6 billion globally by 2050, according to a UN report published last year. In Japan, this change is threatening one of the world\u2019s largest economies as the percentage of older people grows and fewer couples have children. In early June, the country said the number of babies born fell for the eighth straight year, hitting a record low of 727,277 births in 2023 since Japan started compiling data more than 120 years ago. A few months earlier, Japan said that one in 10 people were aged 80 or older, making it the oldest country in the world. Last year, almost 30% of the Japanese population was 65 or older. In June 2023, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida unveiled a multi-billion dollar package of measures to encourage families to have more children. Japan is trying to tackle a demographic crisis that could impact pension funding and health care as\u00a0the workforce shrinks and demand from the aging population surges. The growth of the older population is also changing the consumer product market. Demand for adult diapers in Japan has been rising, while the need for baby diapers has fallen. The global market value for adult diapers was pegged at $12.8 billion in 2023, according to market research provider Euromonitor International. It is expected to reach almost $15.5 billion by 2026. In Japan, the adult diaper market stood at $1.7 billion in 2023, and is expected to grow to $1.9 billion in 2026, accounting for more than 12% of the global total. One example of a company adjusting to this shift is Japanese manufacturer Oji Holdings, which announced in March it would stop producing baby diapers for the Japanese market later this year to focus on incontinence products for adults. The company will continue to run its overseas baby diaper business, it said. Their combined baby diaper sales in China, Indonesia and Malaysia have grown despite a slowdown in the domestic market, where the company sold 7.3% more diapers for adults than babies in 2023. Other Japanese companies have already been adjusting to this shift. Electronics giant Panasonic\u00a0has been researching and developing products aimed at the older population since 1990, according to its website. Kitchen appliance manufacturer Zojirushi is offering product features aimed at senior citizens, such as electric teapots that send an email to a registered address when in use so relatives can keep up with the activities of their elderly family members. Japan isn\u2019t the only place in Asia grappling with aging. South Korea, which has the world\u2019s lowest fertility rate, reported a new low of 0.72 babies per woman in 2023, down from 0.78 in 2022. The government is so concerned it has set up a new agency: the Ministry of Low Birth Rate Counter-Planning. Births are also falling in Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan. According to the UN, six Asian countries or territories will place in the top 10 for the largest share of people age 65 or older in 2050, with Hong Kong leading the list. By 2100, Africa is expected to be the only region where senior citizens represent less than 15% of the population.\u00a0Seniors in Europe, Northern America and Latin America and the Caribbean will likely surpass the 30% threshold by then, according to the UN\u2019s forecast. Although Europe and Northern America now have the highest share of older citizens, Northern Africa, Western Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are expected to experience the fastest growth in the number of older people in the next 30 years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/business/japan-aging-society-baby-care-nhk-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_food_gen-z-drinking-trends-alcohol", "text": "Beer and hot dogs are as patriotic as it gets. But cracking open the cooler at your July 4th barbecue, you could be seeing fewer brews, with alternatives like spiked seltzers, canned cocktail and hard teas stealing their real estate. And you can blame the youngs for that: The youngest cohort of legal-aged drinkers from Gen Z, which encompass the ages from 21 to 26, are \u201cdrinking completely different than any other generation we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d according to NIQ\u2019s Kaleigh Theriault. \u201cThey\u2019re relatively new to their drinking and when they are choosing alcohol they are leaning toward those flavor-forward categories,\u201d Theriault, an associate director of beverage alcohol thought leadership at the consumer intelligence company, told CNN. Beverages created by smaller companies are controlling the landscape. E. & J. Gallo Winery\u2019s High Noon dominates the spirit-based cocktail category; White Claw from Mark Anthony Brands remains the top-selling spiked seltzer; and newer entrants, including punchier drinks that mix liquor with an iced tea or lemonade such as Surfside, a two-year-old brand, are rapidly gaining ground. That\u2019s a problem for Big Beer, which is dealing with flat sales, declining volume and a fickle generation of younger drinkers who are completely ditching the bottle or preferring anything but a regular beer. In response, Miller Lite-maker Molson Coors Beverage Company, Modelo-brewer Constellation Brands and heavyweight Anheuser-Busch InBev are among the larger brewers expanding beyond beer and diversifying their portfolio with flavorful concoctions. Fruit, in particular, has been a focus area because \u201cit\u2019s something that the consumer seems to be drawn to right now and they want to drink something really good,\u201d Theriault said. \u201cThose flavors offer that.\u201d Inspiration from TikTok Constellation turned to TikTok for inspiration for its newest beer, which is lightly based on the \u201cCorona Sunrise\u201d cocktail \u2014 a mixture of tequila, a Corona, orange juice, grenadine, plus a splash of lime juice. It has taken off on the video-sharing app, with the most-watched tutorial racking up nearly 14 million views. Since it\u2019s unlawful to sell a beer mixed with a spirit, Corona spun up its own version to hopefully appeal to younger drinkers: the \u201cSunbrew\u00a0Citrus Cerveza,\u201d which is brewed with orange and lime peels and blended with the same\u00a0juices and mixed with a Corona Extra to mirror the sweet flavor of the cocktail counterpart. \u201cThis new brew was created with the flavor-seeking Gen Z audience in mind, a group of drinkers known for their experimentation and mixing,\u201d noted Sa\u00fal Trejo, director of brand marketing at Corona, in a press release. For now, the drink is only available in the northeastern US before possibly expanding nationwide depending on sales. Sunbrew fits into Constellation\u2019s portfolio with a few other Gen Z-angled beverages like Fresca Mixed and its malt-based beverages, Corona Refresca and Modelo Spiked Aguas Frescas, both of which also have fruity flavors and are selling well for the company. TikTok has also influenced Molson Coors for one of its newest boozy beverages called \u201cHappy Thursday.\u201d The shtick? It\u2019s a non-carbonated drink because \u201cbloating that may come from carbonation is considered a top barrier\u201d for younger drinkers and the trend of \u201cdecarbonizing\u201d drinks is blowing up on the app. The \u201csmooth, bubble-free\u201d drink comes in four fruit flavors, including strawberry and black cherry, and also meets another need for Gen Z since it\u2019s low in alcohol content at 4.4% by volume. It also has bright packaging designed to \u201cpop on social media,\u201d the brewer notes. Launched less than three months ago, sales and distribution are both growing and feedback has been \u201cextremely positive\u201d for Happy Thursday, the company said on its blog. The company could shed more light on its sales during its next earnings report in August. Happy Thursday fits into the company\u2019s strategy that began in 2019 when Molson Coors tweaked its name to encompass its growing portfolio of beverages besides beer. That now includes hard iced tea, energy drinks and its Simply Spiked lineup. Last year, it acquired Blue Run Spirits, a cult favorite high-end bourbon and rye whiskey brand, in light of US spirit sales\u00a0surpassing beer sales. \u201cSuppliers, in order to stay relevant, have to evolve and follow where the consumer is trending \u2014 and right now the consumer wants flavor,\u201d NIQ\u2019s Theriault said about their pivots. \u201cInnovation is really important in the alcohol industry and ensuring that innovation is tied to the consumer trends is what\u2019s right for business.\u201d Building \u2018beyond beer\u2019 Canned cocktails and spirits-based beverages have also helped Anheuser-Busch\u2019s bottom line in the US, especially in light of the collapsing sales of Bud Light. Its aptly titled \u201cBeyond Beer\u201d category is currently a $1.5 billion part of its global business and is helping attract younger, legally aged drinkers. N\u00dcTRL, a flavorful lineup of vodka seltzers, and Cutwater Spirits canned cocktails are two standouts. An Anheuser-Busch spokesperson told CNN that Cutwater, which has a collection of canned rum mai tais, vodka mules and tequila palomas, has \u201csteadily grown dollar sales double digits for five consecutive years\u201d and jumped an additional 23% in sales this year. Still, it\u2019s not all rosy for Anheuser-Busch, especially if a drink has the Bud Light name attached. Bud Light Seltzer sales are down 50%, according to trade publication Brewbound, outpacing a larger decline in malt-based seltzers as drinkers shift toward spirit-based drinks. The company launched a new advertising campaign in 2023 just a few weeks before the Dylan Mulvaney controversy derailed its parent brand\u2019s sales. Despite younger drinkers\u2019 hesitance with buying beer and flat sales, Big Beer companies aren\u2019t facing an existential threat. In fact, it\u2019s the exact opposite, according to one expert. \u201cYoung drinkers can now find just about any kind of drink in just about any kind of flavor practically whenever they want, and they get to choose from the most diverse collection of beverages that has ever existed \u2014 with and without alcohol,\u201d Bryan Roth, an analyst for Feel Goods Company and editor of the alcohol beverage newsletter, Sightlines+, told\u00a0CNN. \u201cThese long-tenured and often historic companies are adapting to the market. What makes it particularly exciting is that consumers are more often leading the way,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/food/gen-z-drinking-trends-alcohol/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_us_unite-the-right-victims-damages-reaj", "text": "A federal appeals court ruled on Monday that white supremacist and nationalist groups will have to pay a more than $2 million in punitive damages to people who suffered physical or emotional injuries from the 2017\u00a0\u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. In 2021,\u00a0a jury ruled\u00a0white nationalist leaders and organizations had to pay more than $26 million in damages to those who suffered injuries from the rally. The \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally was a two-day event to protest the city\u2019s plan to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Approximately $24 million of the $26 million were for punitive damages, but a judge\u00a0later cut\u00a0that\u00a0amount to $350,000, meaning the eight plaintiffs were going to receive only $43,750 each. However, according to court documents, restoring more than $2 million of the slashed amount means each plaintiff will receive approximately $350,000. A three-judge panel of the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals\u00a0found a state law which caps the total dollar amount\u00a0of punitive damages each person can receive to $350,000, court documents show. In Monday\u2019s opinion, Chief Judge Albert Diaz wrote, \u201c\u2026 we vacate the district court\u2019s order to the extent that it reduces the jury\u2019s punitive damages to $350,000 for all plaintiffs under the Virginia punitive damages cap. And we remand with instructions that the district court apply the cap instead on a per-plaintiff basis.\u201d Before the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally began, counter-protestors clashed with white nationalists and other right-wing groups which prompted local officials to declare the rally an \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d and the governor declared a state of emergency,\u00a0CNN previously reported. About two hours later, James Alex Fields Jr., a white supremacist from Maumee, Ohio, intentionally drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one woman and injuring dozens more. Fields is serving a life sentence for murder and hate crimes. Fields\u2019 lawyer was not immediately\u202favailable for comment. When the defendants requested the court ask the Supreme Court to question the $350,000 rule, the 4th Circuit panel rejected it and said the law was \u201cclear enough to predict how Virginia\u2019s high court would rule.\u201d \u201cOver two years ago, the jury used its $24 million punitive damages award to send an unmistakable message to the defendants and to the public about the outrageous misconduct that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia,\u201d Diaz wrote in the 3-0 ruling. \u201cWhile the law compels us to reduce the award, it\u2019s long past time for that message to be delivered.\u201d CNN reached out to the defendants\u2019\u00a0lawyers who were not immediately available for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/unite-the-right-victims-damages-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_us_replica-handgun-utica-police-shooting", "text": "Before an officer fatally shot Nyah Mway last week as he ran from law enforcement in upstate New York, the 13-year-old had pulled out what police said appeared to be a handgun. But it wasn\u2019t a real gun, authorities later discovered, they\u2019ve said \u2013 only one capable of firing pellets. Still, the firearm \u2013 which is entirely black, photos released by the Utica Police Department show \u2013 carried the same \u201cGlock markings, signatures, detachable magazine and serial numbers\u201d as a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun, Utica Police spokesperson Lt. Michael Curley told The Associated Press. \u201cThis weapon in every facet resembles a real GLOCK handgun, in functionality, appearance, and design,\u201d he told CNN, adding it\u00a0\u201cfires .177 pellets.\u201d Nyah Mway apparently pointed the handgun at three officers while he ran away from them after dark, body camera footage released by Utica Police shows. The officers yelled \u201cgun,\u201d and one officer tackled and punched the teenager. As they wrestled on the ground, another officer fired a single shot, the video shows. The teen was taken to a local hospital where he died, police said. Imitation guns have led to unintended fatal consequences over the years, posing challenges for law enforcement who interpret them as real in a nation with more guns than people. Here\u2019s what we know about such items and some other cases: What imitation firearms are \u2013 and aren\u2019t Toy, look-alike and imitation firearms are devices that \u201chave the appearance, shape, and/or configuration of a firearm,\u201d according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the agency that enforces federal rules governing them. The term \u201clook-alike firearm\u201d includes:\u2022 Toy guns\u2022 Water guns\u2022 Replica nonguns\u2022 Airsoft guns firing nonmetallic projectiles Some other guns that don\u2019t fire live bullets, however, are not considered \u201clook-alike firearms.\u201d The term does not include:\u2022 Non-firing collector replica antique firearms\u2022 Traditional BB, paintball or pellet-firing air guns\u2022 Decorative, ornamental and miniature objects that have the appearance of a firearm and measure no more than 38 mm by 70 mm (excluding any gun stock length) In Utica,\u00a0police initially said Nyah Mway was holding\u00a0\u201ca replica GLOCK pellet gun.\u201d It appears a firearm with that description would not be considered a look-alike under the federal rule \u2013\u00a0although at night, it may have been virtually impossible for a police officer to know that. What regulations require of look-alikes While federal law does not govern the transfer, use or possession of imitation guns, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, the way such items look when they\u2019re \u201cmanufactured and entered into commerce\u201d is regulated \u2013 to a degree \u2013 by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Every look-alike firearm \u2013 that is: toy guns, water guns, replica nonguns and airsoft guns that fire nonmetallic projectiles \u2013 must either:\u2022 have a permanently affixed blaze orange plug inserted in the firearm\u2019s barrel\u2022 have a similar marking on the exterior of the barrel\u2022 be constructed entirely of transparent or translucent materials\u2022 or be covered in certain bright colors The rules \u2013 in place since 1989 \u2013 don\u2019t apply to non-firing replicas; BB, paintball or pellet guns; or decorative or mini firearms. They also do not cover \u201chow consumers use or enjoy their products,\u201d according to the commission. Under those rules, it appears the Consumer Product Safety Commission would not require the gun Nyah Mway was carrying to bear \u201clook-alike firearm\u201d markings, such as an orange plug or transparent or bright coverings, either because of its pellet projectiles or as a replica. Being able to buy a look-alike or imitation gun also can depend on the law. For example, while Amazon sells a variety of imitation firearms, the online marketplace won\u2019t ship airsoft guns, non-powdered weapons like BB guns, pellet guns, paintball guns and air rifles or toy guns to places with sales restrictions, its policy states. Amazon, Walmart and three other retailers announced a deal in 2015 with the then-attorney general of New York \u2013 where Nyah Mway was fatally shot \u2013 to stop selling realistic toy guns there. And Pennsylvania, Florida, Delaware and other states impose age restrictions on the possession, use or transfer of some non-powder guns, according to the Giffords Law Center. \u2018No one could reasonably tell the difference\u2019 Police across the United States shot 305 people brandishing non-powder and toy firearms between 2015 and 2023, according to a Giffords Law Center analysis of the Washington Post\u2019s Fatal Force database, which tracks fatal shootings of civilians by police. While police in Utica initially said Nyah Mway was holding\u00a0\u201ca replica GLOCK pellet gun,\u201d they later clarified the term \u201creplica\u201d was used to describe its physical condition because of its resemblance to a Glock handgun, the department told CNN on Tuesday. \u201cIn the future we will ensure that we utilize proper terminology so that there is no mistake in what we are trying to portray,\u201d Curley said. Imitation handguns in the hands of anyone \u2013 especially juveniles \u2013 pose many challenges for police departments across the country, Curley added. \u201cAs we see in this tragic incident, split second decisions have to be made when individuals are in possession of realistic looking weapons that are indistinguishable\u00a0from their real counterparts,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one could reasonably tell the difference between the two, much less in high stress situations where the item is being displayed.\u201d Imitation guns have led to other fatalities In New York \u2013 where Nyah Mway was shot and killed \u2013 at least 63 shootings, eight of them fatal, unfolded as a result of people mistaking imitation weapons for real ones, according to 2015 data from the state Office of the Attorney General. Beyond that, hundreds of crimes have been committed in New York City with imitation weapons, the office said. No new data was available on the issue, it told CNN this week. Just last month, a teenager with an airsoft gun was fatally shot by an armed man who \u201ctook it upon himself\u201d to conduct surveillance outside a sporting goods store in Washington state, according to court documents. The armed man \u201cassumed\u201d the teen and two others were about to commit a violent robbery, the prosecutor wrote. The man has been charged with murder. His attorneys say he was acting in self-defense, protecting himself and others. Several years before that, Antonio Arce, 14, was fatally shot by police in Tempe, Arizona, while holding what later was determined to be a replica 1911 airsoft gun he\u2019d just stolen from a truck reported to police as suspicious. The officer who fired was not criminally charged in Arce\u2019s death. And in 2014, Tamir Rice, 12, was shot and killed outside an Ohio recreation center when an officer opened fire after authorities mistook a black, toy airsoft pistol Tamir had for a real firearm. The US Justice Department in 2020 found insufficient evidence to support federal criminal charges against the former officer who fired his weapon at Rice.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/replica-handgun-utica-police-shooting/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "us"}}

Soaring temperatures \u2013 which will continue into next week \u2013 have dried out already-parched vegetation, increasing the wildfire risk across the region. Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for the area of the fire, clearing the path for additional resources, including the possibility of mobilizing the California National Guard to assist. The\u00a0governor\u2019s proclamation\u00a0cites \u201ccontinued high temperatures throughout the day and night, dry conditions, and strong winds\u201d that have increased the intensity and spread of the fire. A local emergency was also declared, and\u00a0evacuations were ordered\u00a0on Tuesday evening for some residents\u00a0in\u00a0the city of Oroville,\u00a0as the Thompson\u00a0Fire\u00a0continues to burn in\u00a0Butte County, according\u00a0to local officials. Cal Fire said the blaze has grown to more than 3,500 acres and was zero percent contained in an update around noon local time on Wednesday. One of the people who evacuated Tuesday was Arielle Penick, 24, who also left her home from Paradise during the deadly 2018 Camp Fire. On Tuesday afternoon, Penick, who is pregnant, packed up her things in Oroville with her 5-year-old son, her fianc\u00e9 and her fianc\u00e9\u2019s two kids. \u201cWe just see a pummel of smoke in the sky. And the PSTD from the Camp Fire kicked in instantly, especially with how big the cloud of smoke was,\u201d Penick said. \u201cWe gathered as much stuff as we could. Our three dogs, our dog crates, all the dog food, my kids\u2019 favorite toys, all their diapers and wipes, their favorite bedding, their chairs,\u201d she said. Penick is now staying at the home of a friend \u2013 who is also a Camp Fire survivor. 4 firefighters hurt as more than 1,000 battle blaze Four firefighters battling the blaze have been injured, Cal Fire said. More than 1,400 firefighters are working to suppress the flames, along with eight helicopters and numerous air tankers, the agency said. About 13,000 people in\u00a0Butte County, including northeastern parts of Oroville,\u00a0were ordered to evacuate,\u00a0according to the sheriff\u2019s office. Oroville is\u00a0about 65 miles\u00a0north\u00a0of Sacramento with a population of around 15,000. The town sits about 20 miles south of Paradise, where the Camp Fire killed more than 70 people in 2018. Some of the residents impacted by that fire ended up relocating to Oroville. The city of Oroville\u2019s July 4 fireworks celebration was canceled by California State Parks on Wednesday as firefighters continue to battle the fire, the department said in a news release. \u201cDue to the large evacuations and damages caused by the\u00a0Thompson Fire,\u00a0State Parks and partner agencies \u2026 have a large number of resources responding to protect the community and get everyone back home as quickly as possible,\u201d State Parks said. \u201cThese agencies also have employees with families displaced by these evacuations who are tirelessly assisting the community of Lake Oroville.\u201d Red flag warnings are in effect across the West, including in the fire zone, because of extreme heat, gusty winds and low humidity. Already high temperatures will only ramp up Wednesday as an exceptional, long-lasting heat wave begins. Oroville will see\u00a0record temperatures of 110 or more each of the next five days \u2013 Saturday may reach an all-time record high of 113 \u2013 making it that much harder for fire crews to fight the blaze. The\u00a0Basin Fire in Fresno County has\u00a0burned more than 13,000 acres and is currently only 26% contained. \u201cOutdoor burning and especially fireworks are\u00a0not\u00a0recommended,\u201d the\u00a0weather service\u00a0in\u00a0San Francisco warned ahead of the Independence Day holiday. Triple-digit temperatures across parts of US Nationwide, more than 150 million people across at least 22 states in parts of\u00a0the\u00a0Mid-South and West are under heat alerts. The heat wave is \u201cexceptionally dangerous and lethal,\u201d the weather service in San Francisco said, warning \u201can event of this scale, magnitude, and\u00a0longevity will likely rival anything we\u2019ve\u00a0seen\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0last\u00a018\u00a0years\u00a0for\u00a0inland areas.\u201d The heat began Tuesday across parts of\u00a0the\u00a0West, where numerous daily high temperature records were tied or broken: Some cities could swelter through multiple days of temperatures well above 100 degrees with some, including Sacramento, potentially\u00a0seeing a full week of highs over 105 degrees. Most of California outside of\u00a0the\u00a0immediate coastline is under excessive\u00a0heat\u00a0warnings. High temperatures from\u00a0the\u00a0upper 90s to as high as 115 degrees are possible. Las Vegas could\u00a0see\u00a0high temperatures all week over 110 degrees.\u00a0The\u00a0current record is 10 consecutive days set last\u00a0year. Death Valley\u00a0could\u00a0see\u00a0high temperatures at or above 120 degrees all week. Heat\u00a0is expected to spread to\u00a0the\u00a0Northwest and to parts of Arizona\u00a0including Phoenix by\u00a0the\u00a0weekend, where triple-digit temperatures are expected, with parts of Arizona\u00a0seeing highs above 110 degrees. A 10-year-old died Tuesday in Arizona after experiencing a heat-related emergency while hiking with family in South Mountain Park and Preserve, authorities said. First responders performed an active mountain rescue and airlifted the child to the hospital, where he later died, the Phoenix Police Department said. On Saturday, a 69-year-old hiker from Austin, Texas, died at the Grand Canyon, according to the National Park Service. Scott Sims became unconscious on the trail and attempts by bystanders and paramedics to resuscitate him were unsuccessful. Park rangers warn that summertime temperatures on the trail can reach over 120 degrees in the shade and advise not hiking during the day, between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Efforts to assist hikers can be delayed during the summer due to increased need and limited resources, the park service said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/us/thompson-fire-california-heat-wave/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "us"}}

Instead, the woman,\u00a0identified in public records by her initials \u201cTR,\u201d had been masquerading as her wife, Peggy Randolph, then a licensed clinical social worker, according to an investigative report from the Florida Department of Health. Randolph, who provided services to clients in Tennessee and Florida for her employer Brightside Health, helped her wife conduct online therapy sessions using her credentials while Randolph was seeing other patients in person, the report and a settlement agreement between Randolph and the state of Tennessee detailed. But Randolph\u2019s wife was not licensed or trained to provide any sort of counseling services,\u201d according to a settlement agreement between Randolph and the state of Tennessee. The couple\u2019s \u201ccoordinated effort\u201d to defraud patients came to light when Randolph was taking bereavement leave after her wife died, the documents stated. CNN tracked down an\u00a0online obituary\u00a0for 58-year-old Tammy Heath-Randolph that lists Peggy Randolph as the deceased\u2019s wife. Heath-Randolph (TR) died on February 11, 2023, just weeks before a patient complained to Brightside. Randolph \u201cdenies knowing\u201d\u00a0Heath-Randolph had been conducting therapy sessions using her Brightside Health Therapist Portal log-in credentials, the settlement agreement states. However, Brightside\u2019s internal investigation revealed Randolph had provided those credentials to her wife who \u201cwas seeing all her patients and had been for a long time,\u201d according to the Florida report. Randolph also received compensation for the sessions her wife conducted, the settlement agreement states. When\u00a0she was presented with a photograph showing Heath-Randolph with one of her clients, she acknowledged that she was her wife. Brightside Health took \u201cswift and decisive action\u201d once it learned of the breach, a statement provided to CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely disappointed that a single provider was willing to violate the trust that Brightside and, most importantly, her patients had placed in her,\u201d the statement said. The impacted patients were fully reimbursed, Brightside Health said. The company also revoked Randolph\u2019s access to its software systems immediately after receiving notice of the incident and ended her contract, it said. Randolph worked for the company\u00a0from January 2021 until February 2023, according to the settlement, which says she was\u00a0\u201cassigned to provide therapy sessions to hundreds of clients.\u201d\u00a0It\u2019s unclear how many patients were seen by her wife during that time period. In an emailed statement, Brightside spokesperson Hannah Changi told KFF Health News that Brightside couldn\u2019t say how many patients were seen by Randolph\u2019s wife \u201cdue to the nature of the incident and ongoing legal proceedings.\u201d Randolph gave up her license voluntarily in both Florida and Tennessee and in May was ordered by the state of Tennessee to pay a $1,000 civil penalty within 12 months.

{"id": "2024_07_05_politics_joe-biden-abc-interview", "text": "President Joe Biden on Friday downplayed his poor performance in last week\u2019s debate, offering additional excuses for the showing and adding that it was his fault alone. The president said in an interview on ABC that he was \u201csick\u201d and \u201cfeeling terrible\u201d before the debate. Asked whether it was a bad episode or a sign of a more serious condition, Biden dismissed those concerns. \u201cIt was a bad episode. No indication of any serious condition. I didn\u2019t listen to my instincts in terms of preparing, and I had a bad night,\u201d he said. In the interview, Biden also gave more details about how he was feeling at the time of the debate, saying he was fatigued from illness and had even been tested for Covid-19. The White House did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s inquiry as to whether the president took the test before or after the debate. He said, \u201cBecause I was sick \u2013 I was feeling terrible. As a matter of fact, the docs with me I asked if they did a Covid test, they were trying to figure out what\u2019s wrong. They did a test to see whether or not I had some infection, you know, a virus. I didn\u2019t. I just had a really bad cold.\u201d The conversation was Biden\u2019s first televised interview since his debate performance, a high-stakes moment for his political future as a mounting list of Democrats \u2013 lawmakers, donors and voters \u2013 express concerns about the viability of his candidacy. Four Democratic members of Congress have called on Biden to step down. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey issued a statement Friday asking Biden to \u201ccarefully evaluate\u201d whether he is the party\u2019s best choice to defeat Donald Trump. And Virginia Sen. Mark Warner is looking to get Senate Democrats on the same page about the future of\u00a0Biden\u2019s reelection bid, sources told CNN, putting further pressure on the White House. Warner, who is taking on a leadership role in the effort, is reaching a place where he thinks it is time for Biden to suspend his reelection campaign, a source familiar with his efforts told CNN. The comment about his illness marked the latest turn in the White House\u2019s description of the president\u2019s physical condition during the debate. White House officials told reporters during the debate that the president had a cold, and then on Wednesday, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre dismissed the idea that Biden had been seen by his doctor, repeatedly saying that the president has had no medical exams since his February physical. \u201cIt\u2019s a cold, guys. It\u2019s a cold.\u201d she said at the time. \u201cI know that it affects everybody differently. We\u2019ve all had colds, and so no, he was not checked out by the doctor.\u201d A day later, the White House confirmed that the president had, in fact, seen a doctor about his illness, and on Friday Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One that Biden\u00a0had a \u201cverbal check-in\u201d with his doctor after the debate. She cast Biden\u2019s check-in as \u201ca conversation\u201d with his doctor, Kevin O\u2019Connor, after reporters noted that the president told a group of Democratic governors that he saw a doctor. \u201cSo he did have a short verbal check-in in the recent days about his cold. It wasn\u2019t a medical exam or physical, just want to be super, super clear about that. It was a conversation and his doctor didn\u2019t think an examination was necessary,\u201d Jean-Pierre said Friday after saying Wednesday that Biden \u201cdid not get checked out by the doctor.\u201d The president said he has not watched a replay of his performance. When he was asked whether he knew how badly it was going, he said it was \u201cnobody\u2019s fault but mine.\u201d As he answered the question, Biden offered a confusing tangent on New York Times polling. \u201cI prepared what I usually would do sitting down as I did come back as foreign leaders or National Security Council \u2013 for explicit detail. And I realized, about partway through that \u2013 you know, all that I get quoted is The New York Times had me down 10 points before the debate, nine now, or whatever the hell it is. The fact of the matter is that \u2013 what I looked at is he also lied 28 times,\u201d he said. Pressed on his performance, he said, \u201cWell I was just having a bad night.\u201d A fired-up Biden says he\u2019s staying in the race Biden came face-to-face with voter concerns just before the ABC interview, as he was taking the stage at a campaign rally in Wisconsin. A rally attendee unfurled a sign reading, \u201cPass the torch, Joe.\u201d The sign was visible for a few moments before someone else tried to cover part of it with a Biden-Harris sign. Biden\u2019s speech during that rally was animated and energetic \u2013 though he seemed to realize that each of his words would be parsed and carefully scrutinized in this politically crucial period. He vowed to \u201cbeat Trump again in 2020\u201d before quickly realizing his mistake and correcting himself: \u201cBy the way, we\u2019re gonna do it again in 2024.\u201d Slamming Trump\u2019s economic policy, Biden said his opponent \u201cwants another 5 billion - trillion, trillion, not billion - $5 trillion tax cut.\u201d He directly addressed criticisms about his age: \u201cI wasn\u2019t too old to create over 50 million new jobs, to make sure 21 million Americans are insured under the Affordable Care Act, to beat Big Pharma \u2026 Was I too old to relieve student debt for nearly 5 million Americans? Too old to put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court of the United States of America? To sign the Respect for Marriage Act?\u201d Biden said unnamed forces are \u201ctrying to push him out of the race.\u201d \u201cWell, let me say this as quick as I can,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m staying in the race.\u201d That point was punctuated by the song that played as Biden\u2019s speech concluded: Tom Petty\u2019s \u201cI Won\u2019t Back Down.\u201d This is a breaking story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/politics/joe-biden-abc-interview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "us"}}
{"id": "us_national-education-association-antisemistism", "text": "Several items being proposed at an upcoming education convention in Philadelphia\u00a0are raising concerns among a pro-Israel advocacy group about potential antisemitism and anti-Israel bias. Delegates of the\u00a0National Education Association (NEA), the largest teachers\u2019 union in the United States,\u00a0will meet at\u00a0the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia\u00a0for their annual representative assembly from Wednesday to Sunday. Two rallies were held Wednesday outside the convention hall, one by the Educators for Palestine group \u2013 which is made up of NEA members - and a counter rally by StandWithUs, a nonprofit pro-Israel advocacy organization. StandWithUs has characterized several proposed agenda items being discussed as antisemitic. Although\u00a0the proposed agenda items\u00a0are typically confidential before being voted on at the representative assembly, Educators for Palestine have outlined several in their call to vote yes. CNN has not seen the proposed agenda items. The NEA did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for information on the\u00a0agenda items in question. Both groups aim to raise awareness among NEA delegates about several\u00a0agenda items that\u00a0reportedly\u00a0call for the NEA to\u00a0align itself with the \u201cBoycott, Divestment, and Sanctions\u201d movement against Israel, distinguish between antisemitism and anti-Zionism, and educate members about the Nakba, a term referring to the mass displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, according to information from both Educators for Palestine and StandWithUs. The past year has seen heightened tension in classrooms across the country, including incidents of antisemitism and anti-Palestinian hate, especially following an attack by Hamas on Israel in October. \u201cAs the largest teachers union in the United States, the NEA has a significant influence on educational policies and practices. Before and especially after the atrocities of October 7th, a number of local and state NEA union affiliates have been embroiled in major controversies regarding antisemitism and anti-Israel bias. In some cases, this has resulted in Jewish families moving their children to different school districts with a less hostile learning environment,\u201d a\u00a0release\u00a0from StandWithUs said. \u201cThe NEA must ensure a safe and inclusive environment for all educators and students, and maintain public trust in what is being taught in our classrooms. Passing antisemitic and anti-Israel resolutions would not only harm Jewish members, but also undermine the integrity of public education,\u201d David Smokler, director of K-12 educator outreach at StandWithUs, added. On the other hand, Educators for Palestine urge NEA delegates to vote yes on the agenda items, stating, \u201cAs educators, we must be open to educating each other, and learning from one another. We stand in solidarity with working class people around the world. Help us fight for a liberated Palestine, and a liberated people!\u201d A NEA spokesperson told CNN regarding the rallies, \u201cThe members of the\u00a0National Education Association\u00a0and delegates to its annual Representative Assembly are committed to educating and nurturing understanding in their students of every race, faith, and background.\u201d \u201cNEA has a deep history that is steeped in civil rights and advocating for racial and social justice. Over many decades, the delegates of the\u00a0NEA Representative Assembly\u00a0have adopted resolutions expressing our union\u2019s condemnation of war, terrorism, hate, and violence. The vast majority of NEA delegates, members, and our society want to see a peaceful and lasting solution to this conflict,\u201d their statement added. About 50-100 people came to each rally. Many carried signs and some waved flags. A group of police officers with bicycles separated the groups. Samy El-Baroudi, a business teacher from Des Moines, Iowa, who told CNN he was an organizer of the Educators for Palestine rally, said the NEA has taken stands before as it did against apartheid and should for the Palestinian people. \u201cWe stood up against so many injustices across the world, why is this one different?\u201d he asked. El-Baroudi said he has proposed a new business item asking for the NEA to determine a concrete definition of \u201cgenocide,\u201d a word he said is probably one of the most misunderstood words in the English language. \u201cWe want to have an honest, fair conversation,\u201d he said. At the other rally, Smokler said some teachers are bringing biased and inappropriate materials into classrooms and telling children what to think and not how to think. A small group of radical extremists are trying to get their propaganda into new business items, he told CNN as he stood near a protester who held a sign that read, \u201cCritical thinking, Not indoctrination.\u201d He said the NEA should be focused on improving conditions for teachers and students, not geopolitics. The rallies remained peaceful and there appeared to be no arrests.

With her statement, Healey became the first sitting Democratic governor publicly call on Biden to think about stepping aside \u2013 a significant departure from the public statements of support other governors in the meeting issued. It comes as cracks have begun to appear in Biden\u2019s coalition. Three Democrats in Congress \u2013 Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas, Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona and Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts \u2013 have asked Biden to bow out. Those calls were signs of the unsteadiness of Democratic support for their top candidate. Some of the president\u2019s comments during Wednesday\u2019s meeting left participants frustrated. Biden told the governors that he needed more sleep and planned to stop scheduling late-night events. He also made a joke that didn\u2019t go over well with some of the them: \u201cI\u2019m fine \u2013 I don\u2019t know about my brain, though.\u201d Biden campaign officials and top surrogates have spent the week since his disastrous debate performance trying to soothe the anxieties of major donors, voters and other down-ballot Democrats. But Biden himself was slow to call party leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. His Wednesday meeting with the governors came after some of them expressed frustration with not having heard from the president. But while Doggett and Grijalva were the first fractures in Biden\u2019s coalition, the vast majority of party leaders remain behind him. Several of the governors who attended Wednesday\u2019s meeting released statements firmly in support of the president. \u201cI heard three words from the President \u2013 he\u2019s all in. And so am I. Joe Biden\u2019s had our back. Now it\u2019s time to have his,\u201d\u00a0California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0said in a statement after the meeting. Michigan Gov. Gretchen\u00a0Whitmer said in a tweet that Biden \u201cis our nominee. He is in it to win it and I support him.\u201d CNN reported earlier this week that Biden sees the next few days as key to his political survival. Among the key events are a campaign rally in Wisconsin Friday afternoon and another event in Pennsylvania on Sunday, along with a high-profile interview on Friday with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/politics/maura-healey-joe-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/06/2024", "section": "us"}}
