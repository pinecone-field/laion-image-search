The new tower will be built in Jeddah and developed in tandem with Dar Global, the international arm of Saudi mega-developer Dar Al Arkan. If completed, it appears the Jeddah tower would be the Trump Organization\u2019s first major project in Saudi Arabia. \u201cWe are thrilled to expand our footprint in the Middle East and bring the Trump standard of luxury to the region through our long-standing relationship with Dar Global,\u201d Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of former president Donald Trump, said in the announcement. Dar Global said the project will target the \u201cluxury Saudi Arabian market and international investors.\u201d The new project in Saudi Arabia comes just days after the Trump Organization and Dar Global unveiled a $500 million Trump International hotel complex in Oman. That five-star hotel complex, set to open in December 2028, would include a nightclub, golf course and members-only club. Dar Al Arkan has agreed to use the Trump name and logo under license for that hotel, which is not owned by the Trump Organization. The Trump Organization\u2019s new projects in the Middle East could raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest should former President Donald Trump return to the White House. \u201cThe Trump Organization\u2019s continued pursuit of foreign business projects raises perilous national security, corruption and constitutional concerns,\u201d Donald K. Sherman, senior vice president and chief counsel at the Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Washington (CREW), told CNN in a statement. \u201cThis is particularly true of their development in Saudi Arabia, whose government has a long history of apparently seeking to influence Donald Trump,\u201d Sherman added. \u201cIf Trump were to return to the presidency, he would likely violate the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, as he did repeatedly in his first term in office.\u201d A 2023 analysis by CREW found that Trump made at least $9.6 million from countries in the Middle East during his presidency. The Trump Organization is owned by a private trust that lists the former president as the sole beneficiary. The family business is run by his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. Last year, the Trump Organization was fined $1.6 million by a New York judge for running a decade-long tax fraud scheme. Two Trump entities were convicted of 17 felonies, including tax fraud and falsifying business records. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The investment firm run by Jared Kushner, the former president\u2019s son-in-law who helped advise on foreign policy during the Trump administration, reportedly secured a $2 billion investment from the Saudi royal fund. Last month, Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, launched an investigation into Kushner\u2019s firm and its ties to Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern governments. Wyden expressed concern that the investments in Kushner\u2019s firm could create \u201csignificant conflicts of interest and potential counterintelligence risks.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/business/trump-tower-saudi-arabia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_business_france-election-markets-euro", "text": "French stocks and the euro rallied Monday after results from the first round of elections suggested the far right will inflict a heavy defeat on President Emmanuel Macron but fall short of winning an outright majority in parliament. France\u2019s CAC 40 index, which represents 40 of the biggest companies listed in Paris, rose 2.7% at the open. The index closed 1% higher on the day but is still almost 6% below its level before Macron called the snap election on June 9. Bank stocks, a bellwether for the economy, reversed some of the heavy losses they have suffered in recent weeks. Shares in BNP Paribas closed 3.6% higher, while Societe Generale and Credit Agricole climbed 3.1% and 2.8% respectively. The euro, which tumbled after Macron\u2019s surprise election announcement, briefly touched the strongest level against the dollar in more than two weeks Monday. Yields on French government bonds, or returns demanded by investors for the risk of holding them, were broadly unchanged after widening significantly compared with their ultra-safe German equivalents in recent days. On Friday, the risk premium over German government debt hit its highest level since the eurozone crisis\u00a0more than a decade ago. While the defeat for Macron is likely bad news for France\u2019s precarious finances \u2014 a hung parliament could mean gridlock \u2014 the worst-case scenarios for investors appear to have receded. Just two weeks ago, they were fretting about the possibility that France could be heading for a financial crisis similar to the 2022 UK market crash triggered by unfunded tax cuts pushed by former Prime Minister Liz Truss. After unusually high voter turnout Sunday, Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally party led the first round, clinching 33.15% of the vote, while the left-wing New Popular Front coalition came second with 27.99%. Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance slumped to a dismal third with 20.76%, according to final results published Monday by France\u2019s Interior Ministry. \u201cThe result is probably better than feared (for markets) but not as good as the status three weeks ago pre-elections,\u201d Mohit Kumar, Jefferies chief economist for Europe, wrote in a note Monday. \u201cThe immediate reaction is one of a relief rally.\u201d Going into the first round, investors feared that voters would elect a far-right or far-left parliament committed to spending more, further swelling the country\u2019s already-high debt and budget deficit \u2014 the difference between what the government spends and what it receives in taxes. At the end of last year, France\u2019s government debt amounted to 110.6% of gross domestic product. The budget deficit reached 5.5%\u00a0of GDP, one of the highest among the 27 countries in the European Union. Sunday\u2019s vote may have tempered the risk of extreme fiscal policies in Europe\u2019s second-largest economy, but investors are still concerned that a new, divided parliament won\u2019t be able to tackle the country\u2019s debt problem. \u201cWe could still be looking at the next few years of political paralysis in France with a stalling of the reform process,\u201d said Kumar, referring to Macron\u2019s policies aimed at boosting economic growth. \u2018Gridlock\u2019 ahead? Several other analysts also view a hung parliament as the most likely outcome, which would mean no single party holds a majority of seats. That could result in \u201cgridlock,\u201d according to Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmieding. \u201cIn this case, any new government would not get much done,\u201d he wrote in a note Monday. Worse than gridlock would be if Le Pen\u2019s National Rally joined forces with parts of the left to cut taxes and reverse some of Macron\u2019s reforms, such as raising the retirement age to 64 years for most workers. The National Rally has pledged to slash value-added tax on electricity, fuel and other energy products from 20% to 5.5% and suspend it entirely for scores of basic necessities. Meanwhile, the left-wing New Popular Front has pledged to increase the minimum wage and freeze prices for many essential goods. A third scenario \u2014 dubbed \u201cMarine Meloni\u201d \u2014 could see Le Pen follow the example of Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and concentrate on signature policies such as a tough stance on immigration while watering down \u201cmore expensive or disruptive fiscal promises,\u201d with a view to winning the 2027 presidential election, according to Schmieding. \u201cThe three main scenarios above entail a gradual worsening of the outlook for France\u2026 But they do not point to an immediate Liz-Truss style crisis,\u201d he said. In the long term, there could be a partial reversal of some of Macron\u2019s reforms, reducing economic growth and raising inflation. \u201cCoupled with the prospect of (credit) ratings downgrades, this would add to financing cost and exacerbate France\u2019s fiscal woes over time,\u201d he added. Ratings agency S&P\u00a0downgraded\u00a0the French government\u2019s credit rating in May, citing the \u201cdeterioration of (its) budgetary position,\u201d though it still thinks the country has ample capacity to repay its debts. With the final round of voting set for July 7, the outcome of the French election is still uncertain, with the door still open for Le Pen\u2019s National Rally to win a majority. \u201cWe are doubtful this morning\u2019s improvement in sentiment will be maintained as we head into the next round of voting,\u201d Rabobank analysts wrote in a note.

{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_business_ice-cream-best-shop-maker", "text": "I went to ice cream college. Yep, it\u2019s a thing. This past January, I spent one week at Penn State University waking up with the cows (literally), learning about emulsifiers and freezing techniques, and experimenting in a lab to see milk, cream and sugar come together to form the most wonderful of treats: ice cream. Technically, it\u2019s called the \u201cIce Cream Short Course,\u201d and it\u2019s offered one week every year at Penn State University. Some people simply refer to it as \u201cice cream college.\u201d \u201cOur target audience is people who are serious about ice cream,\u201d says Dr. Bob Roberts, Ph.D., the head of the food science department at Penn State. This is the place where the ice cream people go to learn about ice cream.\u202fSome companies, like Tillamook, send people every year. Employees from Hudsonville, Turkey Hill, Perry\u2019s, Stewart\u2019s Shops, Hershey, Friendly\u2019s, Graeter\u2019s, Jeni\u2019s, Baskin Robbins and more all attended this year. Even Ben and Jerry (yes, the Ben and Jerry) once took a version of the class. Well, that\u2019s definitely not me. Yes, I have a passion for ice cream. My first job was working at a small ice cream stand, and now I\u2019m the person who will drive miles out of the way to find the local homemade scoop shop. But I\u2019m no professional. I make ice cream at home with my countertop Cuisinart, testing out recipes and flavors. I simply wanted to learn more, so I found my way to Penn State. I knew the course would be serious, but I\u2019m not going to lie, I still thought I\u2019d be eating ice cream every day. I didn\u2019t. I thought I\u2019d be making ice cream. I didn\u2019t. But the Penn State Short Course turned my passion into a true appreciation, because now I understand why one pint of ice cream can cost $10, and another costs $5. The science of\u2026 ice cream? Very quickly, I learned that ice cream college is just that \u2014 college. There was homework, extra help sessions (I absolutely went), studying (aka cramming), an exam, class rankings (to my relief, only the top 10 were revealed), an ending banquet and certificate (um, is this graduation?). And I wasn\u2019t alone as an amateur. About one third of the class said they had little to no experience or were an aspiring entrepreneur. One couple was even taking the course as part of their honeymoon! But what was ice cream college all about? In a word: science. Ross Cohen, the CEO and co-owner of Sweet Cow, a Colorado ice cream company, said understanding the science behind ice cream matters. \u201cThe most important thing I learned was better understanding our ice cream mix\u2013 that\u2019s the milk, cream and sugar and all the goodness that is the base of every ice cream we make\u2013 better understanding how the ingredients interact with each other.\u201d And understanding the ice cream mix means learning what\u2019s happening at a molecular level. For example, how the milk proteins interact with fat and what happens when you change an ingredient. That meant classes on milk composition, dairy ingredients, food microbiology and ice cream physics. \u201cEverything is easy when things work,\u201d Dr. Bob told me. \u201cWhen things don\u2019t work \u2026 you need to understand the science. You need to understand the chemistry. You need to understand the engineering.\u201d Once you understand that, he said, you can figure out how to change those ingredients (think: almond milk instead of cow\u2019s milk) and still have a product that looks, feels and tastes like ice cream. This was on display in one of our labs\u2014 a sensory evaluation class. We were presented with 14 samples of vanilla ice cream. Ok, I know what you\u2019re thinking\u2026 a sampling class sounds awesome! Yes, it was. But I can assure you, that much ice cream in one sitting requires pacing and strategy. And again, it\u2019s about science. We tasted 14 ways to make vanilla, and each tasted different. Some were dense and melted slowly (higher milk fat content). Some had a flavor similar to dulce de leche (cooked longer). Others were light in weight (higher air content). The idea? Not all ice cream is created equal, and understanding ingredients matters for your final product. From cow to cone The Penn State Ice Cream Short Course has a 132-year history. The school describes itself as \u201ccow to cone,\u201d which means students can see cows being milked and then follow as that milk gets made into ice cream and eventually sold at the famous Berkey Creamery, all on campus. The passion behind the treat-making shows in Penn State\u2019s numbers. Years ago, the course took several months to fill up. Now, it takes just days, or even hours, depending on the year. Dr. Bob remembered a recent year when there was so much demand that the Penn State registration system crashed. The people who put on the course, Cohen said, \u201care true ambassadors for the industry.\u201d They open their \u201cdoors to anyone to get a real inside look at what they do.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re looking to share every bit of knowledge to help people get better,\u201d he said. For the professionals, said Ruben Urrutia, a 30-year ice cream veteran who\u2019s now the director of plant operations for Tillamook, the course is \u201cjust that extra notch in our belt to make us a little bit stronger in our field of expertise.\u201d\u202fHe likened it to NFL players reviewing film of their games. For amateurs, the course peels back the curtain on something that for many, is simply a vehicle for joy and community but is much more complex in its creation. No matter their background \u2014 ice cream dreamer or expert \u2014 there\u2019s one thing everyone seemed to agree on. The course\u2019s biggest benefit was the people you meet and the network you build at the class. Students have an idea what the course is going to cover, but you don\u2019t know fully what it all entails, so there\u2019s an organic we\u2019re-in-this-together feeling right away. Dr. Bob said his job \u201cis to make the canvas that (students) can paint on.\u201d \u201cI hope they go away with a good network of ice cream connections so that when they have a question, they know who to call to get an answer,\u201d he said. I know I have. I walked away from Penn State with my own ice cream community that\u2019s rooting for me as I churn away in my little countertop machine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/business/ice-cream-best-shop-maker/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_30_business_barbecue-grills-july-fourth-weber-traeger", "text": "Americans binged on grills during the pandemic, but the barbecue industry now faces a number of threats, including high meat prices and interest rates on top of economic uncertainty. Many feel no need to upgrade fairly recent purchases. Market leaders like higher-end grill manufacturer Traeger, once a pandemic darling, reported its latest quarter\u2019s grill sales were $76.8 million \u2014 a plunge from the $156.1 million the company raked in during the second quarter of 2021. Best-selling grill brand Weber has also seen its market share decline since 2020, according to data from TraQline. (Weber did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.) Home Depot also reported pressure in more expensive patio and garden equipment, including grills, during its first quarter in May, part of a larger dip in sales and earnings. And it\u2019s not just the big brands. Local stores that sell grills and other backyard cooking gear similarly reported demand dropping.  \u201cIt\u2019s trending down,\u201d said Brian Bushfield, general manager at West Coast BBQ Shop in San Diego, California. He noted a sluggish start to June and a slow Memorial Day, despite the holiday being one of the most popular occasions to purchase new grills. America might be less interested in buying grills, but they\u2019re still using them a ton. And there\u2019s evidence that the great BBQ sales evaporation may have hit a floor. Lockdown was a grill (seller)\u2019s best friend Americans\u00a0aren\u2019t\u00a0cooking outside on grills less. At least, that\u2019s according to statistics from the Hearth, Patio & Barbecue Association that reported 80% of U.S. homeowners owned a grill or smoker in 2023 \u2014 up from 64% in 2019.\u202fOf the new grill owners surveyed, 27% cited cooking more at home during Covid as the reason for their purchase. Other than barbecue grills, consumables like charcoal pellets and propane tanks make up Home Depot\u2019s grill category. Home Depot Senior Merchant of Grills Joe Downey said that these items drive a large portion of sales and that they are powered by new customers who purchased grills during the pandemic returning frequently to buy fuel. \u201cMore cooks are cooking at home than ever before,\u201d he said. The cost of food at home fell earlier this year as the cost of eating out rose, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that reported a 0.2% dip in grocery prices from March to April. Roy Morchian, owner of American Royal Hardware in Montclair, New Jersey, told CNN that the number of grills sold in 2020 rose to 160 from his store\u2019s yearly average range of 80 to 120 grills. And while their sales \u201chave come back to normal\u201d now closer to pre-pandemic levels, he notices new faces have joined familiar ones when purchasing propane tanks to fuel the Weber grills they stock. Most grill makers and retailers seem to agree that the pandemic pulled forward demand for grills and other long-lasting home equipment as people searched for ways to fill their days and entertain their families at home. San Diego Grill Pros owner Jessica Hernandez recounted \u201castronomical\u201d sales numbers and dubbed 2020 their \u201cunicorn year.\u201d Corey Martin, VP of Marketing at Texas Star Grill Shop described droves of people flocking to their Houston branch to buy grills and shelling out thousands of dollars for higher-end models like Weber\u2019s Genesis, which retails between $800 and $1,800, and Traeger\u2019s Timberline, which starts at about $3,000. \u201cIt was like a really busy grocery store,\u201d he said of his shop. But he and his staff knew that 2020 might be an aberration and the windfall might not last. \u201cIt would be stupid to be in a grill business and think that Covid was the new normal,\u201d Martin said. He said retailers who sell grills know it\u2019s a slow growth and seasonal industry. Downey sees Home Depot\u2019s grill sales stabilizing now following the lockdown-driven high. He anticipates that pandemic-purchased grills will reach the end of their life cycle and bring returning buyers with them in 2025. \u201cThe bottom has been reached and we are on the upswing in terms of getting closer to the end of [the grill] life cycle,\u201d he said. A key issue is a grill\u2019s life cycle: an average grill could last about five years and Americans purchased more than 21 million grills and smokers in 2020. It\u2019s clear that the replacement phase still hasn\u2019t kicked in quite yet. Reigniting the market Meanwhile, grill sellers are looking for ways to stoke demand. Beyond running familiar summer promotions for popular grilling days like Memorial Day and Father\u2019s Day, Downey said that Home Depot is trying to encourage young first-time homeowners to buy grills by introducing them to well-known brands at lower price points. Downey said somebody purchasing a $99 Weber kettle later might look to buy the compact Weber Spirit. \u201cThen as they grow, maybe they\u2019ll aspire to get into the Weber Genesis,\u201d he said, referencing the brand\u2019s more expensive model. Ace Hardware is running advertisements promoting its longstanding free assembly and delivery on grills \u2013- from brands such as Big Green Egg, Blackstone, Weber and Traeger \u2013 priced $399 and up, for Ace Rewards members, which is a free program to join. Traeger CEO Jeremy Andrus told CNN of the soft demand period \u201cWe are not waiting for this to end and riding it out.\u201d He pointed to Traeger hosting weekend cooking demonstrations outside of retail stores like Home Depot and Ace Hardware. \u201cIf we have an opportunity to get in front of the consumer and not only explain what a Traeger does but give them an opportunity to taste the food cooked off of a Traeger, it\u2019s a very effective conversion tool,\u201d he said. But firing up demand in a traditionally slow-growth industry is a challenge, according to Simeon Siegel, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets who follows Traeger. \u201cIf someone has a barbecue, they\u2019re not going to buy another simply because it\u2019s on sale,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, if someone doesn\u2019t need to buy a grill, there\u2019s only so many things companies can do to create demand.\u201d And economic trends haven\u2019t helped. Beef and veal prices rose the fastest among other food categories in 2024 and the US Department of Agriculture expects prices to rise another 4% this year. Some consumers are abandoning meat entirely. A year and a half ago, Bloomfield, New Jersey, resident Shikhiu Ing traded grilled meat for greens as a part of a conscious health decision. While he describes firing up his grill three times a week during the pandemic, he now finds less use for it after going mostly vegetarian. \u201cIt\u2019s non-functional right now. Grilling vegetables is kind of a chore to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just faster in the air fryer. Throw some broccoli in there, air fry. You got vegetables.\u201d Hot grill summers are here to stay? The grill industry isn\u2019t a stranger to slumps or about-face shifts in consumer demand. Andrus pointed to grill sales declining in the years following the 2008 recession before returning to growth for the next 10 years as a testament to the industry\u2019s resiliency. \u201cAmericans love to cook outdoors,\u201d he said. \u201cThey always have, they always will.\u201d For Newark, New Jersey, native Ayla Dunkley, cooking outdoors has been a family tradition. \u201cI learned how to grill from my grandfather and my father, so I learned everything from them,\u201d she said. Following her grandfather\u2019s advice, Dunkley replaces her Blackstone cooker every three to five years and waits until the summer season is over to shop at lower prices. Fourth of July cookouts will\u00a0cost $71.22 on average for 10 guests this summer, according to data from the American Farm Bureau Federation. That\u2019s up 5% from last year and up 30% from 2019. Yet Dunkley\u2019s annual plans to celebrate the holiday with her family in Pennsylvania are still on, grill in tow.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/business/barbecue-grills-july-fourth-weber-traeger/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}

According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude.

However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_business_state-farm-california-rate-hikes", "text": "State Farm is seeking increases of as much as 52% for some of its residential insurance rates in California, which could ramp up the financial burden for many homeowners and renters in the state\u2019s troubled insurance market. It\u2019s the third major change for State Farm in California within the last year. The insurer stopped selling insurance for new homes in the state last summer, citing wildfire risks and skyrocketing construction costs. The insurer, California\u2019s largest, is requesting a 30% rate increase for its homeowners line, a 52% rate increase for renters and a 36% rate increase for condominium owners. State Farm was previously approved for a 20% hike for homeowners\u2019 and condominium owners\u2019 policies last December. The company said in a statement that its state subsidiary, State Farm General, is \u201cworking toward its long-term sustainability in California\u201d and that the rate increases are \u201cdriven by increased costs and risk and are necessary for State Farm General to deliver on the promises the company makes every day to its customers.\u201d \u201cWe continue to look for ways to maintain competitive rates and help our customers manage their risk,\u201d a State Farm spokesperson said. \u201cCustomers with questions are encouraged to speak with their local State Farm agent. The agent can review the customer\u2019s policy, including deductibles and coverages.\u201d The California Department of Insurance has to approve the rate changes. \u201cState Farm General\u2019s latest rate filings raise serious questions about its financial condition,\u201d California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in a statement. \u201cThis has the potential to affect millions of California consumers and the integrity of our residential property insurance market.\u201d Lara said his agency \u201cwill investigate State Farm\u2019s financial situation, including a rate hearing on these applications if necessary.\u201d He added that \u201cnothing changes today for State Farm policyholders as a result of these filings. We are going to lead with facts to make sure Californians are protected.\u201d The company made its previous decision to hike rates \u201cdue to historic increases in construction costs outpacing inflation, rapidly growing catastrophe exposure, and a challenging reinsurance market,\u201d according to a May 2023 statement from State Farm General. (The changes didn\u2019t affect its existing auto insurance coverage.) California has seen an average of\u00a0more than 7,000 wildfires each year, consuming an average of over 2 million acres, over the past several years, according to data from the governor\u2019s office. Scientists and California authorities blame the climate crisis for the intensity of the fire seasons. A few months following State Farm\u2019s decision to stop offering new home insurance, Farmers Insurance also started limiting new homeowners insurance policies in California, citing high costs and wildfire risks. Farmers is the second-largest provider of homeowners insurance in the state, after State Farm. It\u2019s getting\u00a0harder and harder to find homeowners insurance\u00a0in the states that are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. In Florida, Farmer\u2019s also recently stopped offering its home, auto and umbrella policies in the hurricane-prone state. \u2013CNN\u2019s Cheri Mossburg contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/business/state-farm-california-rate-hikes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_07_02_business_ftc-sealy-mattress-firm-merger", "text": "The Federal Trade Commission unanimously voted to block mattress maker Tempur Sealy\u2019s purchase of Mattress Firm on Tuesday. In May 2023, Tempur Sealy \u2013 the world\u2019s largest mattress supplier and manufacturer \u2013 agreed to buy the United States\u2019 largest bedding retailer in a roughly $4 billion deal. The FTC authorized a lawsuit in federal court to block the acquisition. The Commission said that the proposed deal would suppress competition and raise prices for mattress buyers, and give the companies \u201cenormous power\u201d in the mattress supply chain. The FTC also said that documents showed that competing mattress suppliers would lose access to its most important retail channel. These suppliers employ thousands of American workers, it said. \u201cThrough emails, presentations, and other deal documents, Tempur Sealy has made it abundantly clear that its acquisition of Mattress Firm is intended to kneecap competitors and dominate the market,\u201d said Henry Liu, Director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition in a press release. \u201cThis deal isn\u2019t about creating efficiencies; it\u2019s about crippling the competition, which would raise prices on an essential good and could lead to layoffs for good paying American manufacturing jobs in nearly a dozen states.\u201d The deal would have given the combined company 3,000 stores and 71 manufacturing facilities and was expected to close in the second half of 2024. Tempur Sealy\u2019s portfolio includes Tempur-Pedic, Sealy and Stearns and Foster. The deal was seen as beneficial for both parties by analysts, because mattress and furniture sales\u00a0have slowed following a pandemic-induced high, when consumers splurged heavily on home furnishings. Mattress Firm was already dealing with its own financial issues,\u00a0including a 2018 bankruptcy.\u00a0The retailer struggled with over-expansion and online competitors, including Casper and Amazon. The FTC alleges that the reduced competition in the premium mattress space would harm the substantial portion of those mattress buyers \u2013 \u201cworking class, older adults\u201d who often rely on financing. The purchase could drive rivals, which include Serta Simmons Bedding and Purple Innovation, Inc., out of business, the FTC warned. \u201cFor example, the combined firm could limit present and future rivals\u2019 access to Mattress Firm\u2019s floor space, award sales associates higher commissions on Tempur Sealy products sold, or otherwise take steps designed to steer customers away from competitors\u2019 products and toward Tempur Sealy\u2019s mattresses,\u201d the FTC said. In a statement, Tempur Sealy said the bedding industry is \u201chighly competitive\u201d and only a small fraction of brick-and-mortar storefronts are Mattress Firms. It also said it believes a litigation process will be complete in the next few months, and it still expects to close the transaction in late 2024 or early 2025. \u201cTempur Sealy has been working constructively with the FTC to secure regulatory approval for this transaction and is disappointed that the FTC has initiated litigation. We appreciate their efforts to understand the industry and the proposed transaction, but ultimately believe the FTC\u2019s perspective does not reflect all the relevant facts and law,\u201d the statement said. Mattress Firm similarly said it was disappointed in a statement, and said it \u201ccontinues to believe that the transaction with Tempur Sealy will be beneficial to consumers and employees as well as the overall bedding and furniture industry.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context.

{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_business_tesla-sales", "text": "Tesla sales fell for the second straight quarter. It marks the the first time in the company\u2019s history that sales declined from the previous year for two quarters in a row. Tesla\u2019s sales for the quarter came in at nearly 444,000 cars, down about 5% from a year ago. That\u2019s less than the 8.5% drop the company saw in the first quarter. But Tesla, and its share price that has made CEO Elon Musk one of the wealthiest people in the world, has been built on a history of growing auto sales. The drop in sales demonstrates the increased competition within the market for electric vehicles. While overall sales of EVs continue to grow, the pace of industrywide growth has proved to be less than expected, resulting in investors clamoring for each car sold to be more profitable than before. Before this year there was only one quarter in Tesla\u2019s history \u2014 at the peak of the pandemic when factories were closed by stay-at-home orders \u2014 that the company had reported a year-over-year decline in sales. There was some good news in the sales numbers though. Sales were stronger than the 436,000 forecast from some analysts. And it was enough to beat out Chinese automaker BYD to retain the lead position in global sales of purely electric vehicles. On Monday, BYD reported EV sales of 426,000. That is 21% more than a year ago, as BYD continues to close the gap on Tesla. In the fourth quarter BYD briefly passed Tesla in global EV sales. But the better-than-expected Tesla sales were enough to lift shares of Tesla (TSLA) by more than 9% in midday trading. Shares are still down about 8% year-to-date, however, even with Tuesday\u2019s jump. Tesla has been steadily cutting prices for more than a year now in the face of growing competition from established automakers, which are shifting from petroleum-powered automobiles to EVs, such as BYD in China, as well as Volkswagen, General Motors and Ford in Europe and North America. Those price cuts have helped to support sales but have squeezed profit margins. Tesla announced Tuesday that it will report its second quarter financial results on July 23. GM did not report global sales, but it did report US sales figures Tuesday, and its US EV sales jumped 40% compared to a year ago, and 34% from its first quarter total to about 22,000, a record for the automaker. Its overall sales were essentially flat, rising 0.6%, partly hit by the problem with the hack of the CDK platform used by many of its dealers. The strong EV sales were balanced by a slight drop - about 0.3% - in sales of traditional gasoline powered cars. This occurred even as it discontinued what had been its best-selling American EV, the Bolt, which had sales fall 90% from the 14,000 it sold a year ago. But jumps in sales for its Blazer EV and Cadillac Lyriq more than made up for the lost Bolt sales. It continues to offer new EV versions and will have 10 in the US dealerships by the end of the year. Toyota\u2019s US EV sales soared even more, rising 301% to 11,600. But even though they are both grabbing more EV market share, they account for only a fraction of Tesla\u2019s sales. While Tesla does not break out its sales by country in its quarterly sales statement, its filings suggest that somewhere between 43% to 49% of its automotive sales revenue comes from US sales, suggesting about 190,000 of the cars it delivered in the quarter went to US customers. GM and Toyota together have only about one-sixth of that total. But the declining sales show that the increased competition is having an impact on its sales. It has a very old lineup of vehicles for the most part. The Model S, its flagship sedan, has not had a clean-sheet re-design since its launch in 2012. The Model Y, its bestselling model has been little changed since its unveiling in 2019. And the Model Y is one of its newer models. Late last year it started production of its Cybertruck pickup, and the vehicle has seen severe questions about its build quality. Last week Tesla announced the third and fourth recalls of the Cybertruck due to problems with its huge single windshield wiper and a piece of plastic trim along the edge of the truck bed that can detach from the truck while being driven. Virtually all of the 12,000 Cybertrucks that have been sold to customers are included in the recall. In April there was another recall due to an accelerator pedal that could stick down. CNN\u2019s Laura He and Peter Valdes-Dapena contributed to this report. This story has been updated with additional reporting and context.

{"id": "2024_06_27_business_boeing-cause-alaska-air-door-plug", "text": "For months, missing paperwork has hindered the investigation into how a door plug blew off a 737 Max on an Alaska Airlines flight in January, making it difficult to find out who made the near tragic mistake. This week, Boeing disclosed that the paperwork may have caused the problem in the first place. It was already well known that no documentation was found to show who worked on the door plug, which came off the plane after it had reached around 16,000 feet in the air causing an uncontrolled decompression, which injured a few passengers and even tore one\u2019s shirt off. But at a briefing for journalists at Boeing\u2019s 737 Max factory in Renton, Washington, Boeing said that the lack of paperwork is why the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place were never installed before the plane left the factory in October. The workers who needed to reinstall the bolts never had the work order telling them the work needed to be done. Without the bolts, the door plug incident was pretty much inevitable. Luckily, it wasn\u2019t fatal. It\u2019s a sign of the problems with the quality of work along the Boeing assembly lines. Those problems have become the focus of multiple federal investigations and whistleblower revelations, and the cause of delays in jet deliveries that are causing headaches for airlines and passengers around the globe. Boeing may have stepped in it\u2026 again But Boeing may have landed itself in even more trouble with regulators for divulging the details at this stage. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reprimanded Boeing Thursday for releasing \u201cnon-public investigative information\u201d to the media. It said in a statement that the company had \u201cblatantly violated\u201d the agency\u2019s rules. \u201cDuring a media briefing Tuesday about quality improvements\u2026 a Boeing executive provided investigative information and gave an analysis of factual information previously released. Both of these actions are prohibited,\u201d the NTSB said. Boeing will no longer have access to information generated by the NTSB during its investigation, the agency said, adding it was referring Boeing\u2019s conduct to the Department of Justice. \u201cAs a party to many NTSB investigations over the past decades, few entities know the rules better than Boeing,\u201d the NTSB said. In a letter sent to Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun Thursday, NTSB Office of Aviation Safety Director Timothy LeBaron said this week\u2019s media briefing was done without the consent or knowledge of the regulator. \u201cBoeing must take all reasonable steps to ensure that investigative information is protected from public release,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSuch a release or withholding of critical information from our investigators are blatant violations of NTSB\u2019s regulations.\u201d Boeing responded that it held the briefing in an effort to \u201ctake responsibility\u201d and be transparent for its role in the incident. It said it \u201cshared context on the lessons we have learned from the\u00a0January 5\u00a0accident.\u201d \u201cWe deeply regret that some of our comments, intended to make clear our responsibility in the accident and explain the actions we are taking, overstepped the NTSB\u2019s role as the source of investigative information,\u201d said Boeing\u2019s statement. \u201cWe apologize to the NTSB and stand ready to answer any questions as the agency continues its investigation.\u201d The NTSB also chastised Boeing for stating earlier this month that a rare, unsafe back-and-forth roll during a Southwest 737 Max flight in May was not because of a design or manufacturing error. The NTSB, which is investigating that incident, told Calhoun Thursday it had not made a determination yet and Boeing and the NTSB must speak with one voice when making public statements. Bad paperwork trail Boeing said during the Tuesday briefing that the reason the Alaska Air door plug was not probably secured in the first place was because two different groups of employees at the plant were charged with doing the work, with one removing and the other reinstalling the door plug as the plane was passing along the assembly line. The first group of employees removed the door plug to address problems with some rivets that were made by a supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. But they didn\u2019t generate the paperwork indicating they had removed the door plug, along with\u00a0the four bolts necessary to hold it in place, in order to do that work. When a different group of employees put the plug back in place, Boeing says the employees didn\u2019t think the plane would actually fly in that condition. Instead, they were just blocking the hole with the plug to protect the inside of the fuselage from weather as the plane moved outside to a different area of the factory compound. That group of employees often makes those kind of temporary fixes. \u201cThe doors team closes up the aircraft before it is moved outside, but it\u2019s not their responsibility to install the pins,\u201d said Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president of quality for Boeing\u2019s commercial airplane unit. Those employees likely assumed paperwork existed showing that the plug and bolts had been removed, and that paperwork would prompt someone else along the line to install the bolts. But without the paperwork, no one on the assembly line knew that the door plug had ever been removed, or that its bolts were missing, Lund said. Removing a door plug after a plane arrives from Spirit AeroSystems rarely happens, Lund added, so no one was aware the door plug needed attention. \u201c(Permanent) reinstallation is done by another team based on the paperwork showing what jobs are unfinished,\u201d Lund said. \u201cBut there was no paperwork, so nobody knew to follow up.\u201d An accident waiting to happen The plane actually flew for about two months with the door plug in place despite the lack of bolts. But minutes after the Alaska Airlines flight took off from Portland, Oregon, on January 5, the door plug blew out, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Passengers\u2019 clothing and phones were ripped away from them and sent hurtling into the night sky. But fortunately no passengers were seriously injured, and the crew was able to land the plane safely. The missing bolts had been identified in preliminary findings of the National Transportation Safety Board, but that report did not assess blame for the accident. And a final report is not expected for about a year or more. A spokesperson for the NTSB said that the safety agency is continuing its investigation and will not comment on Boeing\u2019s explanation for how the mistake was made. The board released a preliminary report in February that said it had found the bolts were missing when it left the Boeing factory, but it did not assess blame. A final report is not expected for a year or more. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy has testified about the missing paperwork at Congressional hearings since the preliminary report was released. Boeing is addressing the problem by slowing down its assembly lines, and making sure that planes don\u2019t advance with problems under the assumption that those problems will be dealt with later in the assembly process, Lund said. \u201cWe have slowed down our factories to make sure this is under control,\u201d she said. \u201cI am extremely confident that the actions that we took,\u201d will ensure every airplane leaving this factory is safe, she added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/business/boeing-cause-alaska-air-door-plug/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}

But according to the lawsuit, promotional materials for the miniseries are still on some Fox News-linked social media pages, and the miniseries episodes are still circulating \u201conline and in the public domain.\u201d A Fox News spokesperson claimed the lawsuit was meritless and \u201centirely politically motivated,\u201d and said the network looks forward to \u201cvindicating our rights in court.\u201d \u201cThe core complaint stems from a 2022 streaming program that Mr. Biden did not complain about until sending a letter in late April 2024,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe program was removed within days of the letter, in an abundance of caution, but Hunter Biden is a public figure who has been the subject of multiple investigations and is now a convicted felon. Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden\u2019s own making.\u201d The new lawsuit claims Fox News \u201ctargeted Mr. (Hunter) Biden in an effort to harass, annoy, alarm, and humiliate him, and tarnish his reputation.\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s son is seeking an unspecified amount of punitive damages, as well as any profits that Fox reaped from the miniseries, and other corrective measures. \u201cThe miniseries is fictionalized; it is not a news event. It was made for the purpose of trade and advertising, and merely exploits Mr. Biden\u2019s name, image, and likeness for Fox\u2019s commercial benefit,\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers wrote in the lawsuit. Hunter Biden\u2019s team said in the lawsuit that without his consent, Fox News \u201cunlawfully published numerous intimate images (both still and video) of Mr. Biden depicting him in the nude, depicting an unclothed or exposed intimate part of him, as well as engaged in sex acts.\u201d The right-wing network said these images originated form Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0infamous laptop\u00a0\u2013 data from which was leaked by allies for former President Donald Trump in 2020. The president\u2019s son was\u00a0convicted at a trial\u00a0last month on federal gun charges, and faces a second trial this fall on alleged tax crimes. However, he hasn\u2019t been charged in connection with the bribery and foreign lobbying allegations that were at the center of Fox\u2019s \u201cmock trial\u201d series.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/media/hunter-biden-sues-fox-news/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_cars_electric-car-battery-charge", "text": "A British startup may have found the answer to one of the frustrations of driving an electric car \u2014 waiting around for the battery to charge. Nybolt, based in Cambridge, has developed a new 35kWh lithium-ion battery that was charged from 10% to 80% in just over four and a half minutes in its first live demonstration last week. That is much faster than the 20 minutes or so it currently takes some electric cars using a fast charger, such as a Tesla (TSLA) Supercharger. It is also much closer to the two minutes it takes to fill up the average gasoline-powered car. \u201cOur extensive research here in the UK and US has unlocked a novel battery technology that is ready and scalable right now,\u201d Nyobolt\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Sai Shivareddy, said in a statement Friday. \u201cWe are enabling the electrification of new products and services currently considered inviable or impossible.\u201d Nyobolt\u2019s technology builds on a decade of research led by University of Cambridge battery scientist Clare Grey and Cambridge-educated Shivareddy, the company said. Key to its batteries\u2019 ability to be charged super-fast without a big impact on their longevity is a design that means they generate less heat. It also makes them safer as overheating can cause a lithium-ion battery to catch fire and explode. In addition, the materials used to make the batteries\u2019 anodes allow for a faster transfer of electrons. Nyobolt is currently in talks to sell its batteries to eight electric car manufacturers. At 35 kWh, the battery is much smaller than the 85 kWh in a more typical American electric vehicle (EV). Yet the technology may be used in larger battery packs in the future. Comparatively long charging times are a major drawback of EVs currently on the market. They slow down road trips and they\u2019re an inconvenience for owners who can\u2019t charge their cars at home. Nyobolt\u2019s innovation, tested in the firm\u2019s sports car prototype, is particularly encouraging for commercial EV fleets and drivers relying on electric cars in their jobs, according to Paul Marchment, consultant at Arval, a vehicle leasing specialist owned by BNP Paribas. However, another barrier to faster adoption of EVs in the United States and Europe is a lack of public charging infrastructure. Jack Evans, a motoring specialist at Blackball Media, welcomed the news about Nyobolt\u2019s battery, which was tested on a track Thursday using a 350kW DC ultra-rapid charger of the kind that is hard to find on UK roads. \u201cThe units used to charge the Nyobolt battery are few and far between in the UK, so in order for this to really make an impact, there needs to be an increase in the provision of ultra-rapid chargers,\u201d he said. Shivareddy told CNN that the number of fast chargers was rising both in the US and the European Union, and that he expects to \u201cpretty much have them everywhere\u201d by the end of the decade. In North America, three out of four fast chargers are Tesla\u2019s Superchargers, and virtually every big automaker in the US has committed to making EVs\u00a0compatible with Tesla\u2019s charging technology, known as the North American Charging Standard. Nyobolt\u2019s battery is compatible with a Supercharger, the startup told CNN. \u201cWe would love to work with Tesla and other leading (manufacturers) to bring our vision to life \u2014 with the aim of making recharging times the same as refueling times,\u201d Shivareddy said. \u201cThis would require industry to collaborate for the rollout of a large number of such high-power chargers, along with the grid/off-grid power supply.\u201d Not ready for prime time just yet Independent testing of Nyobolt\u2019s batteries by what it called a leading global manufacturer found that they can achieve over 4,000 fast-charge cycles, equivalent to 600,000 miles (965,600 kilometers), while retaining more than 80% of capacity, Nyobolt said in its Friday statement. \u201cThis is many multiples higher than the warranties of much larger EV batteries on the road today,\u201d it noted. William Kephart, an e-mobility specialist at consultancy P3 Group and a former engineer, said EV batteries of the kind Nyobolt has developed could \u201ctheoretically\u201d be charged as fast as the firm is promising, but the challenge was manufacturing such batteries on an industrial scale. A crucial chemical element in Nyobolt\u2019s batteries is niobium but, as Kephart pointed out, last year only an estimated 83,000 tonnes (94,500 tons) was mined worldwide. Compare that with graphite, commonly used as anode material in lithium-ion batteries: an estimated 1.6 million tonnes (1.8 million tons) was produced in 2023. In addition, there are currently \u201ca lot of unknowns\u201d with the niobium battery technology, he told CNN. \u201cThe industry will work it out\u2026 (but) it\u2019s not seen by the industry as a scalable technology just yet,\u201d he added. Besides slow charging, obstacles to EV ownership in the US and Europe include so-called range anxiety \u2014 the concern that the car will not have enough battery charge to reach its destination, especially acute during long drives \u2014 and EVs\u2019 higher average price compared with new conventional cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/cars/electric-car-battery-charge/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_28_business_walgreens-cvs-closing", "text": "Walgreens said Thursday that it plans to close a \u201csignificant\u201d number of its roughly 8,600 stores in the United States. Around 25% of Walgreens\u2019 stores aren\u2019t profitable, and the chain will look to close stores that are right by one another or struggling to hold down theft, CEO Tim Wentworth said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. Walgreens and other retailers have been hit by shoplifting and resorted to locking up items or closing high-theft stores since the pandemic, but Walgreens\u2019 problems are much deeper, including competition and failed growth strategies. Walgreens admitted last year it \u201ccried too much\u201d over the business impact of shoplifting. The latest closures are part of a larger downturn, not just for Walgreens, but for other drug store chains, too, after years of expansion. Walgreens said in 2019 it would close 200 stores and last year announced an additional 150 store closures. \u201cWe are at a point where the current pharmacy model is not sustainable,\u201d Wentworth said. CVS, the largest US chain, closed 244 stores between 2018 and 2020. In 2021, it announced plans to close 900 stores. And Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy last year and will close up to 500 stores. Shifting trends Drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. The majority of drugstores\u2019 sales comes from filling prescriptions. But their profits from that business have dropped in recent years because of lower reimbursement rates for prescription drugs and higher fees. The prices customers pay for drugs and the payments pharmacies receive are largely determined by\u00a0pharmacy benefit managers, known as\u00a0PBMs, which negotiate rebates from drug manufacturers to insurers. PBMs have been cutting reimbursement rates to boost their own profits, said Elizabeth Anderson, an analyst at Evercore IRI. The pharmacy industry has complained that PBMs have too much control over the industry and can squeeze pharmacies. PBMs argue that they help keep drug prices down by negotiating with drug makers. \u201cIf reimbursement rates start to come down and drug stores can\u2019t offset it with other growth, then it has a negative impact on their profitability,\u201d she said. At the same time, the rest of the store that\u2019s supposed to pad the profit margins aren\u2019t doing it so much anymore. The front end of drug stores, where they sell snacks and household staples, have become less profitable, as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart and Costco. Both have grown in recent years. Dollar General\u2019s growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. \u201cThe front end is suffering like other retailers,\u201d Anderson said. Walgreens, CVS and other drug stores have moved into primary care to try to lure in shoppers, adding doctors\u2019 offices to hundreds of stores. Walgreens took a $5.2 billion stake in VillageMD, a primary care network, in 2021. But VIllageMD has not been profitable for Walgreens, and Walgreens has tried to cut costs. It has been closing VillageMD locations and said Thursday it will divest from the company. Helping the company, hurting the consumer Walgreens\u2019 coming closures might help the company\u2019s bottom line, but are likely to hurt access to health care. When pharmacies close, some patients have to travel farther to get the medications they need. Researchers find pharmacy closures lead to health risks such as\u00a0older adults failing to take medication. The loss of a retail pharmacy can leave a void, especially for lower-income households. Roughly one out of every eight pharmacies closed between 2009 and 2015, which disproportionately affected independent pharmacies and low-income neighborhoods, according to a\u00a0study\u00a0published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study found that pharmacies at greatest risk for closures are those with a large customer base on public insurance, which have lower reimbursement rates than private plans, as well as independent pharmacies.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/business/walgreens-cvs-closing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_economy_global-debt-crisis", "text": "Governments owe an unprecedented $91 trillion, an amount almost equal to the size of the global economy and one that will ultimately exact a heavy toll on their populations. Debt burdens have grown so large \u2014 in part because of the cost of the pandemic \u2014 that they now pose a growing threat to living standards even in rich economies, including the United States. Yet, in a year of elections around the world, politicians are largely ignoring the problem, unwilling to level with voters about the tax increases and spending cuts needed to tackle the deluge of borrowing. In some cases, they\u2019re even making profligate promises that could at the very least jack up inflation again and could even trigger a new financial crisis. The International Monetary Fund last week reiterated its warning that \u201cchronic fiscal deficits\u201d in the US must be \u201curgently addressed.\u201d Investors have long shared that disquiet about the long-term trajectory of the US government\u2019s finances. \u201c(But) continuing deficits and a rising debt burden have (now) made that more of a medium-term concern,\u201d Roger Hallam, global head of rates at Vanguard, one of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, told CNN. As debt burdens mount around the world, investors are growing anxious. In France, political turmoil has exacerbated concerns about the country\u2019s debt, sending bond yields, or returns demanded by investors, soaring. The first round of snap elections Sunday suggested that some of the market\u2019s worst fears might not come to pass. But even without the specter of an immediate financial crisis, investors are demanding higher yields to buy the debt of many governments as shortfalls between spending and taxes balloon. Higher debt servicing costs mean less money available for crucial public services or for responding to crises such as financial meltdowns, pandemics or wars. Since government bond yields are used to price other debt, such as mortgages, rising yields also mean higher borrowing costs for households and businesses, which hurt economic growth. As interest rates rise, private investment falls and governments are less able to borrow to respond to economic downturns. Tackling America\u2019s debt problem will require either tax hikes or cuts to benefits, such as social security and health insurance programs, said Karen Dynan, former chief economist at the US Treasury and now professor at the Harvard Kennedy School. \u201cMany (politicians) are not willing to talk about the hard choices that are going to need to be made. These are very serious decisions\u2026 and they could be very consequential for people\u2019s lives.\u201d Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard University, agrees that the US and other countries will have to make painful adjustments. Debt is \u201cnot free anymore,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cIn the 2010s, a lot of academics, policymakers and central bankers came to the view that interest rates were just going to be near zero forever and then they started thinking debt was a free lunch,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was always wrong-headed because you can think of government debt as holding a flexible-rate mortgage and, if the interest rates go up sharply, your interest payments go up a lot. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened all over the world.\u201d \u2018Conspiracy of silence\u2019 In the United States, the federal government will spend $892 billion in the current fiscal year on interest payments \u2014 more than it has earmarked for defense and approaching the budget for Medicare, health insurance for older people and those with disabilities. Next year, interest payments will top $1 trillion on national debt of more than $30 trillion, itself a sum roughly equal to the size of the US economy, according to the Congressional Budget Office, Congress\u2019s fiscal watchdog. The CBO sees US debt reaching 122% of GDP a mere 10 years from now. And in 2054, debt is forecast to hit 166% of GDP, slowing economic growth. So how much debt is too much? Economists don\u2019t think there is a \u201cpredetermined level at which bad things happen in markets,\u201d but most reckon that if debt hits 150% or 180% of gross domestic product, that means \u201cvery serious costs for the economy and society more broadly,\u201d said Dynan. Despite growing alarm over the federal government\u2019s debt pile, neither Joe Biden nor Donald Trump, the main 2024 presidential candidates, are promising fiscal discipline ahead of the election. During the first televised presidential debate last week, hosted by CNN, each candidate accused the other of making America\u2019s debt situation worse, either through tax cuts by Trump or additional spending by Biden. British politicians have also buried their heads in the sand ahead of a general election Thursday. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, an influential think tank, has decried a \u201cconspiracy of silence\u201d between the country\u2019s two main political parties, over the poor state of public finances. \u201cRegardless of who takes office following the general election, they will \u2014 unless they get lucky \u2014 soon face a stark choice,\u201d IFS director Paul Johnson said last week. \u201cRaise taxes by more than they have told us in their manifestos, or implement cuts to some areas of spending, or borrow more and be content for debt to rise for longer.\u201d Countries trying to tackle the debt issue are struggling. In Germany, ongoing infighting over debt limits has put the country\u2019s three-way governing coalition under enormous strain. The political standoff could come to a head this month. In Kenya, blowback over attempts to address the country\u2019s $80 billion debt burden has been much worse. Proposed tax hikes have sparked nationwide protests, which have claimed 39 lives, prompting President William Ruto to announce last week that he would not sign the proposals into law. Enter the scary bond market But the problem with putting off efforts to rein in debt is that it leaves governments vulnerable to far more painful disciplining by financial markets. The United Kingdom offers the most recent example in a major economy. Former Prime Minister Liz Truss triggered a collapse in the pound in 2022 when she tried to force through big tax cuts funded by increased borrowing. And the threat hasn\u2019t gone away. Take France. The risk of a financial crisis there became a serious concern virtually overnight after President Emmanuel Macron called a snap election last month. Investors were worried voters would elect a parliament of populists bent on spending more and cutting taxes, further swelling the country\u2019s already-high debt and budget deficit. Even though this worst-case scenario now looks less likely, what happens after next Sunday\u2019s second round of voting is far from certain. Yields on French government bonds have continued creeping up, reaching their highest level in eight months Tuesday. Dynan at the Harvard Kennedy School says financial markets can quickly become unnerved by \u201cpolitical dysfunction\u201d that causes investors to doubt a government\u2019s willingness to make good on its debt. \u201cWe tend to have a lack of imagination about the scope for things going wrong. If there\u2019s a big event in which the market freaks out about (US) debt, it\u2019s not going to be something that was on our radar,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/economy/global-debt-crisis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_28_business_cdk-massive-car-dealership-outage", "text": "CDK Global is still down heading into the brisk car-selling Fourth of July holiday next week. Auto dealerships use its software to manage everything from scheduling to records, and the mass outage since last week has paralyzed nearly 15,000 dealerships across North America. CDK said last Saturday that it has begun restoring its software, but both car buyers and dealers are currently at a standstill. It has suggested several times that a fix is in order, only to say then that its systems would remain out of commission for a while longer. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the massive software outage. What does CDK Global do? CDK Global provides data and technology to different automotive dealerships. Its systems are used by roughly 15,000 car dealerships across the United States and Canada. CDK operates different software products car dealers use to handle workflow such as keeping records of negotiated deals, to scheduling and communicating about service. Not every dealer uses CDK\u2019s products, and those that do may not use CDK for every dealership task, but the system shutdown has been a problem for many. To protect customer privacy, customers\u2019 details aren\u2019t written out on a piece of paper that\u2019s just sitting on a desk anymore. Instead, information about deals and customer appointments is\u00a0kept in a server that\u2019s now impossible for salespeople affected by the outage to access. Can I still buy a car or get my car repaired? Salespeople and service employees who spoke with CNN say they\u2019ve resorted to using pen and paper to process purchases, which has drawn out the amount of time it takes to buy a car, according to Scott Campbell, a salesman at Capital City Buick GMC in Berlin, Vermont. He estimates wait times have doubled or tripled. Several buyers and repair customers tell CNN they\u2019ve experienced long delays. Don Aycock told CNN he drove 90 miles round-trip from his home to a car dealership in Clay County, Florida, to buy a new Buick on Thursday, a day after the CDK shutdown. He told CNN he was able to buy the car but was unable to sign the title. \u201cWe got a call from them today that we can come next Thursday to sign the paperwork for the title and get a permanent license plate,\u201d he said, noting that it will be another lengthy round-trip drive. In San Diego \u2014 where temperatures in recent days have been pushing 90 degrees \u2014 Robbie Jacob and his wife tried to make an appointment at a Kia service center to fix their car\u2019s broken air conditioning unit. Jacob said the center told them it was unable to service the car, citing the CDK cyber incident, as there were no appointments available and all walk-ins were suspended until next week. Can I still register my car? Midway Automotive uses a CDK product to register cars with the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles. Owner Michael Deveney says that after the shutdown on Wednesday, the dealership started sending customers to their local RMV office in order to register their cars in person after purchase. \u201cThat was up until Thursday. Then customers started being told that (the RMV) wasn\u2019t taking any walk-ins,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were probably getting flooded with customers and started turning people away.\u201d Some 30 miles north in Lynn, Massachusetts, Katelyn Salvato says she hasn\u2019t been able to register a vehicle since last Tuesday. Salvato works as a title clerk for Pride Motor Group, registering cars for three dealerships. \u201cToday\u2026 I sent 21 registrations to be done manually at the Massachusetts RMV,\u201d she said. Callahan echoed those concerns. Under normal circumstances, the CDK software allows the dealership to register a vehicle almost instantaneously, but now the process faces heavy delays. \u201cOur remote registration system is rendered useless without CDK to talk to it. We\u2019ve had to send a runner with the registrations to the DMV to be competed in packs, costing several days where prior it took hours,\u201d Callahan said in an interview with CNN. When will CDK be back online? CDK Global doesn\u2019t believe its systems will return online before June 30. In an automated voice message to clients, CDK said it is making \u201csignificant progress\u201d in restoring its core application. \u201cWe do feel it\u2019s important to share that we do not believe that we will be able to get all dealers live prior to June 30,\u201d the message said. The company also urged dealerships to make alternate plans for their month-end financial reports. However, CDK gave dealerships encouraging news on Wednesday. It said it was able to bring a \u201csmall initial test group\u201d of car dealerships back online. The company also said it\u2019s also working to bring additional applications back online, such as its customer relationship management and service solutions, as well as its customer care channels. Problems began last Wednesday when CDK spokesperson Lisa Finney told CNN that the company was\u00a0investigating a cyber incident. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution and concern for our customers, we have shut down most of our systems and are working diligently to get everything up and running as quickly as possible,\u201d Finney said in the statement. Later that day, the company said most of its critical computer systems were back online. But the next morning, the company told dealerships another incident had happened. Why did systems go down? CDK has said it is working to investigate the shutdown after two cyber incidents brought its systems to a standstill. The company has not confirmed who was behind the incidents. Bloomberg\u00a0previously reported\u00a0the company was negotiating with an Eastern Europe-based hacker group demanding tens of millions of dollars in ransom to end the outage. CDK has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment about the reported ransom. Why is this hack so impactful? While companies used fewer interconnected workflow systems in the past, the move to cloud computing and reliance on third-party software systems \u2014 despite helping daily business operations \u2014 creates complex systems that are more susceptible to widespread hacks. If the main part of the centralized system goes down, it means that everything goes down. Rather than having to hack each dealership individually, all hackers have to do is hack where all the data is stored for all of them. \u201cIt also creates kind of a bullseye and it helps attackers focus their efforts on specific types of infrastructure or specific cloud platforms,\u201d Eric Noonan, CEO of cybersecurity provider CyberSheath, said. And hackers are targeting organizations that serve in the supply chain of industries. By attacking CDK\u2019s software, for instance, hackers were able to bring the vehicle dealership industry to a standstill. That gives hackers leverage to ask for larger and larger sums of money, said John Dwyer, director of security research at Binary Defense, a cybersecurity solutions firm. Though hackers have more leverage, the success of paying a ransom and a speedy recovery is elusive, experts said. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a story written on a company that successfully paid a ransom, and then quickly recovered their systems,\u201d Noonan said. What is the financial impact on dealerships? At a Mazda dealership in Seekonk, Massachusetts, general sales manager Ryan Callahan said the outage has affected nearly every aspect of its business. \u201cThe financial impact it will directly have on us will take months to correct, if not years,\u201d Callahan said. Tom McParland, the owner of Automatch Consulting, a national car buying service, said the outage was impacting customers because they now have fewer dealers to choose from. \u201cIt reduces their ability to get a deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt limits the customer\u2019s leverage.\u201d Some dealers also can\u2019t apply factory rebates without CDK\u2019s software, so customers may miss out on money-saving deals. For customers looking to buy a car, McParland suggested casting a wide net and shopping outside their local market to find the best price.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/business/cdk-massive-car-dealership-outage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_tech_meta-eu-competition-rules", "text": "Facebook parent Meta has been accused of breaking Europe\u2019s new digital competition rules over its \u201cpay or consent\u201d advertising model. Late last year, Meta (META)\u00a0launched\u00a0a service called \u201cSubscription for no ads,\u201d allowing European users of Facebook and Instagram to pay up to \u20ac12.99 ($14) a month for ad-free versions. The alternative is to accept versions with personalized ads. The European Commission said in a statement Monday that, in its preliminary view, \u201cthis binary choice forces users to consent to the (use) of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalized but equivalent version of Meta\u2019s social networks.\u201d If the provisional findings of the Commission\u2019s investigation are confirmed, the EU could hit Meta with a fine equivalent to 10% of its global annual revenue under its landmark Digital Markets Act. Based on the company\u2019s 2023 results, that would amount to $13.5 billion. Meta said it didn\u2019t accept the Commission\u2019s findings. \u201c\u2019Subscription for no ads\u2019 follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.\u201d The EU announcement comes a week after the Commission accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the DMA by preventing app developers from freely directing consumers to cheaper services. The regulators are also investigating Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) under the new law. The DMA, which came into force in March, requires dominant online platforms \u2014 so-called gatekeepers \u2014 to give users more choice, and rivals more opportunities to compete. Online platforms often collect personal data across their own and third-party services and use it in digital advertising services. Margrethe Vestager, a European Commissioner in charge of competition policy, noted in Monday\u2019s statement that Meta had been accumulating personal data of \u201cmillions of EU citizens over many years.\u201d \u201cWe want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalized ads experience,\u201d she said. Michael Koenig, a senior official at the Commission, said Meta must offer users an alternative to \u201cfull\u201d ad personalization that \u201cdoes not rely on this personal data and which is then automatically less personalized and still available to them.\u201d \u201cThen Meta is free to keep a third option, which is a subscription not to see ads at all, or a fourth option which may have some premium features,\u201d he told journalists. The Commission is due to conclude its probe into Meta by late March next year.

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition.

Cup Noodles is trying to change that \u2014 with a new s\u2019mores-flavored instant ramen. The limited-edition offering combines microwavable noodles with a sauce-based flavor blend of chocolate, marshmallow and graham crackers, plus additional mini marshmallows to sprinkle on top. The result: a sweet and gooey dessert you can prepare in just five minutes. While this marks Cup Noodles\u2019 first foray into dessert territory, the noodle maker is no stranger to non-traditional ramen pairings. \u201cCup Noodles Campfire S\u2019mores\u201d is the latest in a series of seasonal flavors aimed at shaking up how consumers perceive the brand. Parent company Nissin will sell the $1.18 soup online and at Walmart stores nationally while supplies last. But a cheap image is one of the challenges facing Cup Noodles, said GlobalData retail analyst Neil Saunders, He sees the brand\u2019s experiments with unconventional combinations as an attempt to elevate its products and expand the occasions when a consumer might choose to eat ramen. \u201cIt\u2019s positioned as being something that\u2019s quite interesting and novel, not just a boring thing you\u2019d buy because you\u2019re on a budget,\u201d Saunders said. Nissin Foods USA Senior VP of Marketing Priscila Stanton pointed to previous limited offerings as Cup Noodles\u2019 efforts to expand beyond a \u201cpantry staple.\u201d That lineup of flavors includes Pumpkin Spice, Everything Bagel and Breakfast (a mixture of the classic breakfast combination of maple syrup pancakes, sausage and eggs). \u201cRamen is eaten at all parts of the day during all times,\u201d she said. \u201cWe believe that ramen can play in all of these different areas, and sweet is definitely one of those areas that we\u2019ve had some success in.\u201d S\u2019mores season With summer season in full swing, there\u2019s been no shortage of s\u2019mores flavored snacks. Brands like Oreo, Pop Tarts and Goldfish have debuted their own renditions of the beloved campfire treat. Despite the saturated s\u2019mores market, Saunders sees Cup Noodles as occupying a unique position that could get people talking because of ramen\u2019s association with traditionally savory flavors. \u201cIt shakes things up in the consumer\u2019s mind,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s sweet, it\u2019s odd, but that actually adds to the \u2018let\u2019s taste this and see what it\u2019s like\u2019 factor.\u201d Nissin sees the main opportunity among Gen Z and millennials. Stanton says younger buyers tend to be more playful with their tastes, adding that the s\u2019mores flavor appeals to the connection between food and childhood memories. \u201cWe believe this nostalgic flavor is going to start a lot of conversations and get people to remember those campfire moments that they had growing up or are still having,\u201d she said. Saunders doesn\u2019t see the s\u2019mores trend ending anytime soon. The snack\u2019s seasonality gives it staying power, he said, comparing it to the recurring pumpkin spice craze in the fall. \u201cI think the s\u2019mores thing is here to stay because it is a very embedded part of consumer culture,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is one of those things that\u2019s a very well-established part of the consumption calendar.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/business/cup-noodles-smores-nissin-ramen/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}

Eighteen months on, Adani \u2014 who has denied any wrongdoing \u2014 has largely recovered from the broadside and the tiny US short seller has revealed how much it made betting against the Indian billionaire: just\u00a0over $4 million. That figure, disclosed for the first time by Hindenburg, was published on the company\u2019s website on Monday, along with details of a letter it said it had received from India\u2019s markets regulator. According to the New York-based firm, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has alleged that Hindenburg\u2019s report on Adani contained inaccurate statements meant to \u201cmislead readers.\u201d CNN has asked SEBI and the Adani Group for comment. This is \u201can attempt to silence and intimidate those who expose corruption and fraud perpetrated by the most powerful individuals in India,\u201d Hindenburg said in its statement. In its blistering report last year, Hindenburg had accused the Adani Group of \u201cbrazen stock manipulation\u201d and questioned the \u201csky-high\u201d valuations of the ports-to-power conglomerate\u2019s firms. Hindenburg said it had taken a short position in the group\u2019s companies, meaning it would benefit if their shares fell. The short seller, named after the 1937 airship disaster, said in Monday\u2019s statement that it made just $4.1 million in gross revenue through gains related to Adani short positions from a relationship with unnamed investor and about \u201c$31,000 through our own short of Adani US bonds.\u201d \u201cNet of legal and research expenses (including time, salaries/compensation, and costs for a 2-year global investigation) we\u00a0may\u00a0come out ahead of breakeven on our Adani short,\u201d it added. Hindenburg\u2019s report caused one of the most stunning upheavals in India\u2019s corporate history. The Adani Group immediately denounced the accusations as \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cmalicious,\u201d but failed to halt the staggering stock market meltdown that followed. Adani\u2019s personal fortune was also hammered, collapsing by more than $80 billion\u00a0in the month following the release of the report. But the group has made a remarkable comeback since then. Shares in\u00a0most of Adani\u2019s 10 listed firms have rallied this year, and the infrastructure tycoon was briefly back as Asia\u2019s richest man. He is currently in second spot, behind fellow countryman Mukesh Ambani, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaire Index.

The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said that while US District Judge Lewis Liman \u201calmost certainly unknowingly\u201d had a\u00a0conflict\u00a0of interest, his partiality could reasonably be questioned because his wife\u2019s ownership of Bank of America\u00a0stock created an \u201cappearance of impropriety.\u201d A spokesman for the Manhattan federal court, where Liman works, declined to comment. Tuesday\u2019s unsigned decision came nearly three years after a Wall Street Journal investigation found that more than 130 federal judges had since 2010 violated federal law and judicial ethics by overseeing cases involving companies in which they or family members owned stock. Bond investors accused Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, NatWest\u00a0and Wells Fargo\u00a0of overcharging them on\u00a0\u201codd-lot\u201d trades, which are worth less than $1 million and comprise most corporate bond trades. Liman, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, was assigned the\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0in April 2020 and dismissed it with prejudice in October 2021, three months after his wife sold $15,000 of Bank of America stock. In February 2022, a court clerk alerted parties to the\u00a0conflict, writing of the judge that the \u201cownership of stock neither affected nor impacted his decisions.\u201d It wasn\u2019t clear when Liman learned of the\u00a0conflict, and the case was reassigned to US District Judge Valerie Caproni, while investors appealed the dismissal. The\u00a0banks\u00a0said Liman\u2019s failure to uncover his\u00a0conflict\u00a0didn\u2019t require recusal or reviving the case.

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}

Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup.

Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing. Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive. Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year.

{"id": "2024_07_02_economy_us-jolts-job-openings-layoffs-may", "text": "The number of available jobs in the US unexpectedly grew in May, signaling continued resilience in the nation\u2019s labor market. Job openings jumped higher to 8.14 million in May, from a downwardly revised 7.91 million in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report released Tuesday. Economists had expected openings would fall to 7.91 million, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Despite the uptick in job postings, which can be quite volatile, May\u2019s JOLTS report marked a significant milestone for the US labor market: The ratio of job openings to those who are unemployed fell to 1.22 available jobs per job seeker, matching the figure seen in February 2020, a month prior to the pandemic lockdowns that shocked the global economy. That ratio has been steadily moving lower since hitting a record 2.0 in March 2022, JOLTS data shows. \u201cThe report was another sign that the labor market is holding firm,\u201d Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a statement issued Tuesday. \u201cSo far there are no indications that job growth will flag this year, so consumer spending power will continue to increase and the expansion looks solid.\u201d Industries seeing the biggest increase in openings included manufacturing (specifically durable goods) and government (federal, state and local). Those seeing the greatest pullback from April included real estate and leisure and hospitality, BLS data shows. Pendulum swings away from workers Other seasonally adjusted measures of labor turnover showed continued stability in the US jobs market, which has gradually cooled in recent months while remaining historically strong. The estimated number of hires moved up to 5.76 million from 5.62 million in April; layoffs and separations bounced higher to 1.65 million in May, up from 1.54 million; while the number of voluntary quits inched upward to 3.46 million from 3.45 million. While both hires and job openings rates (as a percentage of total employment) ticked higher for May, the quits rate and layoffs rate were unchanged. Economists have been closely watching the quits rate \u2014 which has held steady at 2.2% for seven months running \u2014 as it serves as a signal for workers\u2019 willingness to test the labor market\u2019s waters. When people switch jobs, that typically can correlate to bigger pay bumps, which in turn potentially could make it more difficult to rein in inflation. Job-switchers\u2019 pay raises have pared down significantly from the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d period, according to a newly released analysis from Bank of America. Economists there analyzed internal customer data and found that median wage hikes are about half the size they were during the height of pandemic-era job changes. In fact, the median pay raises are just below 2019 levels, David Tinsley, senior economist at the Bank of America Institute, told CNN. \u201cPeople are still moving between jobs at a slightly faster rate than they were pre-pandemic \u2026 but the pay raises they\u2019re getting when they make those moves is a degree softer,\u201d he said. \u201cThat sort of suggests that the pendulum has swung slightly more in favor of firms and away from workers.\u201d Labor market steady or a turning point? The labor market appears to be at a crossroads, Nick Bunker, Indeed Hiring Lab\u2019s head of economic research, wrote in commentary posted Tuesday. \u201cThe words \u2018little changed\u2019 were repeated no fewer than a half dozen times in the May JOLTS release, and virtually every key indicator tracked showed limited notable movement, either up or down,\u201d Bunker wrote. \u201cThis short-run stability is a good thing. But the question remains if this period of calm can continue or if more unsteady times are on the horizon.\u201d \u201cThis current level of job openings is consistent with a healthy, sustainable and balanced market, but any continued declines below these current levels will quickly become more worrisome,\u201d he wrote. It may take an interest rate cut to ensure employers\u2019 demand for workers doesn\u2019t tumble too far, he added. Federal Reserve officials still broadly believe the job market remains on solid footing, which is allowing central banker to comfortably keep interest rates perched at a 23-year high as they await more evidence that inflation is under control. But some Fed officials have noted that the job market has lost momentum recently and that it\u2019s highly unclear whether it will continue to hold steady or weaken further. \u201cIf employment starts falling apart or if the\u00a0economy\u00a0begins to weaken, which you\u2019ve seen some warning signs, you\u2019ve got to balance that off with the progress you\u2019re making on the price front,\u201d Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday during a conference hosted by the European Central Bank in Sintra, Portugal. \u201cThe unemployment rate is still quite low, but it has been rising,\u201d he said. More jobs data coming Friday In May, the US unemployment rate increased to 4%, a rate that hadn\u2019t been seen since January 2022. Still, job growth remained strong in May, coming in at an estimated net gain of 272,000. Economists largely expect that job gains cooled off in June. As of Tuesday, FactSet consensus estimates are for a 189,000 net gain.  First-time claims for unemployment benefits (considered a proxy for layoffs) have drifted higher in recent weeks, landing in line with pre-pandemic averages. \u201cThey\u2019re still low, historically speaking, but they are up between the May and June payroll survey reference months, so we do think we could see some slowdown in job growth over the month,\u201d Marisa DiNatale, head labor economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics, told CNN in an interview. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the latest jobs report at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/economy/us-jolts-job-openings-layoffs-may/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_business_trump-media-stock-truth-social-russell", "text": "If you\u2019ve got money in the market, you might own a little piece of Trump Media \u2014 without even knowing it. Trump Media & Technology is now part of two broad indexes of US stocks: the Russell 1000 Index of large-cap stocks and the Russell 3000 Index. And several popular passive funds \u2014 namely index and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) \u2014 automatically buy whatever shares are part of those Russell indexes. Trump Media (DJT), the owner of conservative social media platform Truth Social, announced its addition to the Russell family on Monday. The company, majority-owned by former President Donald Trump, doesn\u2019t make money and generates very little revenue. As a result, countless retail investors will now own a piece of Trump Media. \u2018Whether they know it or not\u2019 Passive investing in ETFs and other funds has surged over the past 20 years as a way for investors to cheaply diversify their holdings and avoid the risk of focusing on single stocks. Some large funds track the investment results of the Russell 1000. These include ETFs like the iShares Russell 1000 ETF (IWB), with nearly $38 billion in assets, and the $5 billion Vanguard Russell 1000 ETF (VONE), as well as certain mutual funds that are in 401(k) plans and other retirement accounts. These include the $14 billion iShares Russell 3000 ETF (IWV) and the $2.5 billion Vanguard Russell 3000 ETF (VTHR). \u201cPeople might be owning some of that company, whether they know it or not \u2014 and whether they like it or not,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. That said, Trump Media would only be a small part of funds that track the Russell. It would be dwarfed by the holdings of larger companies including Microsoft, Nvidia and Apple. However, Stovall said the Trump Media situation underscores one of the disadvantages of passive investing: Some funds mimic indexes that automatically add stocks based on rules, not based on a careful evaluation of the business\u2019s fundamental strengths and weaknesses. \u201cYou can end up with real dogs that, in my opinion, are not really worthwhile owning. The flotsam gets swept up with the jetsam,\u201d Stovall said. In this case, the Russell 3000 captures the 3,000 largest US stocks. During annual updates, certain stocks are added \u2014 not necessarily because of their earnings potential or the quality of their products, but because they are large enough to qualify. \u201cInvestors seeking to capture a strategy reflecting broad US equities performance can confidently choose the Russell 3000 knowing there are no subjective inclusion or exclusions of stocks,\u201d according to FTSE Russell\u2019s website. Inclusion in the Russell 3000 automatically qualifies a stock to enter either the small-cap Russell 2000 or the larger Russell 1000. Some other indexes include subjective, more analytical criteria. For instance, S&P Global says it invites companies to join its S&P MidCap 400 index only after reviewing their balance sheets and financial viability. Experts have raised significant concerns about Trump Media, which is valued at nearly $6 billion even though it generated less than $1 million in revenue during each of the past two quarters. Its main product, Truth Social, is still a very tiny player in social media. Trump Media has been frequently compared to a meme stock that trades on momentum and hype, not fundamentals. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a vocal critic of former President Donald Trump, believes Trump Media is really worth just $40 million. \u201cThe Truth Social numbers are so absurdly out of the realm of normal business,\u201d Hoffman told CNN. Aniket Ullal, head of ETF data and analytics at CFRA Research, notes that regulators require all indexed ETFs to publish their portfolio holdings daily. \u201cThere is transparency in the holdings for investors who want it,\u201d said Ullal.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/business/trump-media-stock-truth-social-russell/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_business_adjustable-rate-mortgages-higher-payments", "text": "Last year, when Jennifer Hernandez received notice that the mortgage payments on her Houston home would jump about $2,000 per month, she was stunned. Hernandez refinanced her home loan in 2016 using an adjustable-rate mortgage loan, which has a low introductory rate for a fixed initial period. Unlike the more popular fixed-rate mortgage loans, ARMs can offer temporary relief for homebuyers who want to avoid paying higher mortgage rates \u2014 however, they also come with risk. After the fixed introductory period \u00ad\u2014 usually five, seven or ten years \u00ad\u2014 the rate on an ARM loan adjusts periodically based on current market conditions. That means when mortgage rates increase, many ARM loan holders, like Hernandez, experience the unpleasant shock of significantly higher monthly home payments. For thousands of Americans like Hernandez who took out ARM loans five years ago, before interest rates shot up to a four-decade high, that shock is coming this year. Mortgage rates have remained elevated, adding fuel to one of the most unaffordable housing markets in decades. That led ARMs to gain traction despite their drawbacks. According to data from Intercontinental Exchange, a global provider of technology and data, 1.7 million homeowners have bought homes with adjustable-rate mortgages since 2019. Many buyers who bought 5-year ARMs \u2013 one of the more popular offerings \u2013 will graduate into significantly higher monthly payments this year. The fixed period for these ARMs has already reset for 328,000 homeowners \u2013 and 102,000 more loans will reset over the next 12 months, according to ICE. ARM loans gained a bad reputation after the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007 and 2008, after many homebuyers could no longer afford to make their monthly home payments when their rates reset. While the rate of homebuyers choosing ARMs never rebounded to pre-2008 levels, the share of homebuyers using ARM loans has doubled over the past four years, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Is an adjustable rate a good idea? An ARM may make sense for homebuyers comfortable with the risk of interest rate increases or those who plan to move or refinance before the fixed rate expires, Lorriane Jones, a loan consultant in Southern California, told CNN. But when opting for an ARM, it\u2019s key to keep a close eye on the details, otherwise things can turn difficult, fast. Hernandez, who is herself a loan officer, had misremembered the terms of her $1.1 million loan: rather than a 10/1 ARM, which has a fixed rate for the first ten years and resets every year after that, Hernandez had taken out a 7/1 loan. \u201cI just got caught blindsided,\u201d she said. \u201cLife gets in the way, and you get busy. I\u2019ve been slammed with kids and work for the last seven years.\u201d Last October, Hernandez\u2019s mortgage rate jumped by 2% to 5.125%, the maximum allowed in the first adjustment year, according to her loan terms. Most ARM loans come with an interest rate cap to prevent costs from spiraling out of control. Hernandez said her ARM is capped at 8.125%, five percentage points above her initial fixed rate. To Hernandez, it made little sense to refinance the loan while the 30-year fixed mortgage rate remains higher than her new adjusted rate. But this coming October, she suspects her monthly payments will adjust higher. \u201cI\u2019ve made it work, but now I\u2019m going to have to figure out how to make it work again this October,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful having to worry about it.\u201d Andrew Marquis, a loan officer in Lexington, Massachusetts, said he has recently seen a dramatic increase in ARM loan applications. Homebuyers increasingly believe that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the next few years, giving these buyers time to refinance their loans before the clock on the fixed period of their ARM runs out, he said. The Fed doesn\u2019t directly set mortgage rates, but its actions influence them. This year, the Federal Reserve has signaled that it may possibly cut its benchmark interest rate one time. \u201cI would say on the jumbo loans we\u2019re doing, probably 40% of the loans are doing ARMs,\u201d Marquis said, referring to loan amounts above $766,000. Marquis said that taking out an ARM loan might be worthwhile for those with a higher risk appetite. \u201cIf people can save a half a percent on a seven-year ARM versus a 30-year fixed, they\u2019re saving hundreds of dollars a month,\u201d he said. Interest rates can be unpredictable. Hernandez said she saved money in the initial seven years of her loan, but if she could have a do-over, she likely would not have chosen an adjustable-rate mortgage in 2016. \u201cThis increase in payments hasn\u2019t felt good,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just praying that when my October adjustment comes around, rates have come down a little bit.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/business/adjustable-rate-mortgages-higher-payments/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_media_biden-mental-fitness", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s White House repeatedly and aggressively shot down reports\u00a0on\u00a0the president\u2019s age and any possible limitations\u00a0on his ability to perform all the duties of his office. But after his shaky debate performance last week, in which Biden routinely struggled to\u00a0get his point across, some in the White House press corps say they wish they had pushed harder to tell the story. In June, when the Wall Street Journal published a\u00a0lengthy piece\u00a0on President Joe Biden\u2019s mental\u00a0state, the newspaper\u00a0got\u00a0slammed.\u00a0The White House, its allies, and\u00a0some in the media\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources\u00a0\u2013\u00a0criticized the Journal for quoting mostly Republican political foes on the record, who had a clear political motive to damage Biden\u2019s image. No Democrats were quoted on the record making those allegations, and several Democrats complained their on-the-record quotes praising Biden\u2019s sharpness were not included. The\u00a0Journal defended its reporting at the time. Last week\u2019s debate on CNN laid bare many of the concerns the Journal\u2019s reporting had raised \u2013 that the president has good days and bad days but can sometimes seem to slip up. A New York Times report on Tuesday raised similar concerns by those who have recently been in the room with Biden. The Times reported Biden has more frequent \u201clapses,\u201d although at other times he appears sharp. After Biden\u2019s lackluster performance last week, some are questioning whether the White House press corps dropped the ball on fully covering Biden\u2019s limitations. Biden\u2019s\u00a0age issue is not secret or new. Nearly every media outlet has reported on\u00a0growing concerns about\u00a0Biden\u2019s age well before the debate. The White House in the past has complained that the coverage is disproportionate, and that the media is spending more time covering Biden\u2019s age than his accomplishments as president versus former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies. The media has faced accusations that it has not covered Biden\u2019s mental fitness more aggressively because it wants to prop up the campaign in some way \u2013 an accusation the White House reporters CNN spoke to denied. Several White House reporters\u00a0told CNN that\u00a0the\u00a0coverage\u00a0of Biden\u2019s age and his mental stamina\u00a0should have\u00a0pushed harder. They cited several difficulties in doing so before the debate \u2013 from the obvious political motivations of sources who either want to protect Biden\u2019s image or project a certain image, to the blowback from pursuing such reports, especially from the White House and Democrats. A difficult task Like all past presidents, Biden has good days and bad days. It\u00a0can be tricky to report on something as difficult to define as a person aging, when his opponent\u00a0is a convicted felon, who regularly lies and has threatened to use the government to go after his political opponents. Still, some reporters said the press corps\u00a0could\u00a0have done a better job\u00a0covering\u00a0Biden\u2019s physical and mental state. The failure of the media, one White House reporter said,\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0pushing more aggressively\u00a0into Biden\u2019s abilities after the release of the Robert Hurr report in February, which called Biden a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d Biden\u2019s age was also a right-wing talking point for years, something the White House was quick to point out to reporters,\u00a0which\u00a0may have inadvertently turned off any serious investigation. For example, deceptively edited clips of Biden from the G7 spread widely by right-wing media figures were made to seem as though he was aimlessly \u201cwandering off\u201d from fellow world leaders when really, he was speaking to parachutists who had just landed during a demonstration. \u201cThe right-wing media was calling him senile from day one, and that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cThen whenever you report on the age you were in some ways solidifying, giving credence to some people that were actually of bad faith.\u201d All the White House reporters who spoke to CNN for this piece chose to speak anonymously so they could speak more freely about their relationship with the White House. Keeping the president at a distance Reporters said the White House has not made the press corps\u2019 job easy:\u00a0The White House has put up guardrails around Biden, they say, and\u00a0he does not engage in as many interviews or planned press conferences\u00a0as previous presidents. At those events,\u00a0the press might be able to gauge how he\u2019s doing on the spot, without prepared remarks. \u201cThey keep him at arm\u2019s length, and he rarely does extended interviews,\u201d the reporter said of the White House,\u00a0although he acknowledged Biden has started giving more interviews as of late. Biden has done fewer interviews and formal press conferences than his most recent predecessors, according to data compiled by\u00a0Martha Joynt Kumar,\u00a0professor emerita of political science at Towson University who chronicles the presidents\u2019 interactions with the press. But on quick and informal interactions with the press, like shouted questions on the way to his helicopter or plane, Biden\u00a0as of this week has had 588 interactions, Kumar reports, second only to Trump when compared to recent presidents. But those interactions are not the same as an extended press conference, reporters noted. On Tuesday, ABC News announced Biden would sit down with George Stephanopoulos for an interview, his first since the debate. The White House press shop has also been very \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cfairly successful\u201d in mitigating coverage of concerns over the president\u2019s age,\u00a0said\u00a0another White House reporter who works for a different publication. \u201c[B]erating reporters who bring them reporting about age concerns, bemoaning that it\u2019s all anyone writes about (clearly, it\u2019s not) and often attacking pieces after they run,\u201d the reporter told CNN. \u201cI think that\u2019s left some folks to conclude that these stories are too painful to report or that they should pick their spots more. It\u2019s clear the age stories that have angered the White House (and the liberal Twittersphere) the most.\u201d Alex Thompson, a White House reporter for Axios, said on CNN the day after the debate that \u201cthe White House\u2019s response every single time\u00a0it\u00a0has come up for three-and-a-half years has been to deflect, to gaslight, to not tell the truth \u2013 not just to reporters, not just to other Democrats, but even at times to themselves about the president\u2019s limitations at his age.\u201d Still, this White House\u2019s recent conduct with reporters pales in comparison to Trump\u2019s team, which has done everything from revoking press access to reporters they disagree with, to calling reporters the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d The White House declined to comment. Aging doesn\u2019t happen all at once Aging is also not a sudden moment.\u00a0That makes it trickier to report on. \u201cTo some extent, the decline has appeared to be gradual \u2014 hard to notice from day to day \u2014 and that\u2019s perhaps made it harder for reporters to determine when is the right moment to write something,\u201d one of the reporters said. Just a few days before the debate, Biden held a press conference at the G7 alongside Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelensky that passed off without anything of note in Biden\u2019s demeanor. But reporters pointed out (and have published stories noting) that the president has been using teleprompters at most big events, even fundraisers where in the past he might not have. He has also started to use the lower stairs to board Air Force One. Last year, The New York Times published a lengthy piece on the \u201ccomplicated reality of America\u2019s oldest president,\u201d which looked at some of those accommodations and concerns for his age, but also the moments where he showed stamina and vigor. Some reporters said that there has been a distinct change\u00a0within the last year, and that the press corps should have reported more aggressively on the accommodations made for the president. \u201cI think the press, most of the White House press, did suffer from a bit of lack of curiosity,\u201d one of the reporters said. Look who you\u2019re up against Biden\u2019s allies will often question coverage of the president\u2019s age, questioning why reporters focus on the president\u2019s age and mental lucidity and not on Trump\u2019s\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who, at 78,\u00a0was observed falling asleep during his hush money trial, has made his own major verbal flubs and bizarre statements, and regularly spouts complete falsehoods. \u201cIt makes sense to reflect on this now and ask whether we missed or, really, under-reported the story of Biden\u2019s age and decline. But it\u2019s complicated,\u201d one of the reporters said. \u201cThe fact that the political alternative to Biden is an authoritarian who sparked an insurrection and is a convicted felon does not mean that the press is failing American democracy to focus on Biden\u2019s obvious frailty.\u201d One of the reporters said the media can, and do, report on both. Biden\u2019s allies, however, say too much attention is placed on Biden\u2019s age and not on the threat Trump could pose to American democracy. But the reporters say they can, and should, do both. \u201cJust because you are reporting on Biden age, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not reporting on Trump\u2019s lies.\u00a0 I find that argument silly, and it seems one design towards like producing a certain outcome in the election, rather than like an honest reporting,\u201d one of the reporters said. The outlets that had received harsh blowback for their previous reports on Biden\u2019s lucidity now feel justified. A source familiar with the staff behind the Wall Street Journal\u2019s report said that when the piece first published, the reporters were approached by people with sympathy asking how they\u2019re doing \u201cas if something terrible had just happened,\u201d the source said. After the debate, the reporters started to get messages saying they were right.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/media/biden-mental-fitness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}

Nike\u2019s sales grew 1% last year and were flat last quarter, the company reported Thursday. The company projects sales to drop 10% next quarter as the company\u2019s classic brands slow down and Nike faces challenges in the online marketplace. Nike (NKE) stock plunged 12% during after-hours trading. Nike faces a consumer slowdown for discretionary goods and\u00a0tough competition\u00a0from upstart running brands like Hoka and On. Customers are changing their behaviors, passing up discretionary purchases of expensive sneakers and athletic clothing for basics and experiences such as concerts and travel. Nike is also facing new competition. Hoka, a French brand founded as a running shoe for hardcore marathoners that soon caught on in the mainstream, is growing thanks to its emphasis on comfort over traditional style. Meanwhile, Nike\u2019s effort to change its distribution strategy has backfired. The company in recent years has slashed the number of traditional retailers it sells its goods to while shifting to grow directly through its own channels, especially online. Nike has said it can make more than double the profit\u00a0selling goods\u00a0through its own website and physical stores than it can through wholesale partners. Nike has said it would focus its resources, marketing and top products on just 40 select retail partners, such as Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and Foot Locker. But the change hurt Nike\u2019s sales. Nike has since brought back some of the retailers it initially cut out. \u201cNike took it too far and underestimated the importance of third-party retailers. This withdrawal opened the door for those retailers to partner more closely with other brands,\u201d Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients Thursday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/business/nike-sales-stock/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Inflation rates in Canada, the EU and Australia have popped higher in recent months. The latest pricing data out of the United States, however, has been rosy. That contrast has led investors to wonder whether the Federal Reserve\u2019s current higher-for-longer policy isn\u2019t such a bad idea, after all. A shifting of the plates: Over the past year, investors have been vocal in their desire for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, while some central bank officials have been equally vocal about keeping them higher for longer. The friction between the two groups occasionally heats up, erupting in bouts of market volatility \u2014 large upswings after a promising piece of economic data or downswings following a Fed official\u2019s attempt to tamp down Wall Street\u2019s interest rate expectations. But that disconnect appears to be fading as inflation rates in the US continue to ease. Looking abroad: Wall Street has been scared straight by its neighbors to the north and the far west. Prices in Canada unexpectedly rose in May, according to data released shortly after the Bank of Canada cut interest rates for the first time in four years. The next day, inflation in Australia jumped to its highest level in 2024, adding to the fear. In Europe, the eurozone consumer price index moved higher in May, but eased a shade in June \u2014 according to data out Tuesday \u2014 although\u00a0core inflation was flat at 2.9%. The US also had a recent scare as inflation rates ticked higher. \u201cWe believe the loosening of financial conditions in late 2023 may have contributed to the temporary resurgence in price pressures,\u201d said Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, in a note Monday. But after a year of the Fed holding interest rates steady at a 23-year high, inflation rates in the United States are once again declining. The latest Personal Consumption Expenditures index reading along with the most recent Consumer Price Index report released earlier in June both \u201csuggest that the uptick in prices seen earlier in the year has stalled, and the disinflationary process may have restarted,\u201d said Schutte. High inflation readings around the globe are concerning investors, Jos\u00e9 Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, told CNN. That worry has made them more accepting of the Fed keeping rates higher, at least for now. The market outlook for future Fed rate cuts is stabilizing around just one rate cut this year, said Torres. Investors are getting on board with the higher-for-longer outlook. A warning: The Bank for International Settlements, the umbrella body for central banks around the globe, has even taken notice. They warned central banks in their annual report released Sunday to set a \u201chigh bar for policy easing,\u201d noting that there\u2019s a high risk looser rates could spur price increases. \u201cA premature easing could reignite inflationary pressures and force a costly policy reversal \u2014 all the costlier because credibility would be undermined,\u201d the BIS said. Coming up: Investors are looking toward nonfarm payrolls for June, due out Friday morning. Those numbers could provide them with more context about the state of the economy and clues about what the Federal Reserve may do next. Chewy shares fall after surging on revelation of \u2018Roaring Kitty\u2019 meme trader\u2019s 6.6% stake Shares of online pet products retailer Chewy went on a wild ride Monday after Keith Gill, the influential meme stock trader also known as \u201dRoaring Kitty,\u201d revealed a large stake in the company, reports my CNN colleague Krystal Hur. On Monday, Gill said in\u00a0a Securities and Exchange filing\u00a0that he purchased about 9 million Chewy shares (CHWY), amounting to a 6.6% stake in the company. Chewy shares closed 6.6%\u00a0lower on Monday after jumping as much as 10% earlier in the session. Chewy shares began gaining last Thursday after Gill, the individual investor who helped spark the frenzied trading around GameStop shares three years ago, posted a photo of a cartoon dog on his X account. The cartoon\u2019s blue background appeared to be the same blue as Chewy\u2019s logo. Shares of the company surged more than 34% that day at its highs before closing 0.3% lower. Meme stocks more typically move on social media sentiment than fundamentals, often posting huge swings based on the buying and selling of influential traders like Gill. Ryan Cohen, the founder of Chewy, is the chief executive of GameStop, the embattled video game retailer Gill is known for championing.

{"id": "2024_06_27_business_cdk-global-cyber-attack-update", "text": "Cyberattacks seem to be more devastating than ever and taking targeted companies even longer to resolve. The latest attack to receive wide attention continues that trend: An ongoing cyber incident at CDK Global, whose software car dealerships use to manage everything from scheduling to records, has crippled dealerships for days now, with no clear end in sight. In May, a cyberattack on Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit network that includes 140 hospitals in 19 states, forced the system to divert ambulances from several of its hospitals. It took almost a month to fully resolve the issue. And in February ransomware attack on Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of healthcare giant UnitedHealth Group, caused billing disruptions at pharmacies across the US and\u00a0threatened to put\u00a0some health providers out of business. Experts say hackers are getting more sophisticated and can hide in  an organization\u2019s systems for longer undetected. These hackers target companies in a supply chain-style attack, taking down entire industries to leverage more money. And certain industries that often use outdated systems, like healthcare, are becoming even easier targets. \u201cWe can\u2019t even compare what was going on ten years ago to what\u2019s going on today,\u201d Dror Liwer, co-founder of cybersecurity company Coro, told CNN. \u201c(Hackers) are in the game for much bigger gains than they were before.\u201d Why hacks are so much more devastating Hackers are not just more sophisticated, but they\u2019re also more patient, Liwer said. Hackers hide themselves inside an organization\u2019s framework for a while, and move laterally through that framework, affecting numerous parts of the system. They wait until it\u2019s the right time to launch attacks. And the longer the hackers wait, the bigger the damage. \u201cWhen (hackers) turn the attack on and execute, it\u2019s truly crippling to the organization which then generates more revenue for them,\u201d Liwer said. Experts with whom CNN spoke said it\u2019s difficult to get specific details on individual cyberattacks immediately. For one thing, companies want to protect their brand reputation from potential litigation. Also, organizations may not want to reveal specific details of the attack before an investigation concludes, the experts said, in case there are any copycats. Eric Noonan, CEO of cybersecurity provider CyberSheath, said that ransomware attacks typically breach through avenues like a phishing email. These breaches can go undetected for days or even weeks as the hacker moves laterally. The actual deployment of ransomware is often quick and widespread, Noonan said. Most victims find out they\u2019ve been hacked once they lose access to important files or receive digital ransom notes. \u201cRansomware is the digital equivalent of squatters taking over a home. The initial entry goes unnoticed allowing the squatters to occupy and control the property and by the time homeowners notice there is a problem the process for regaining control and ownership is disruptive and expensive,\u201d Noonan said. While companies used less interconnected systems in the past, the move to the cloud and reliance on third-party systems \u2014 despite helping daily business operations \u2014 creates complex systems that are more susceptible to widespread hacks. \u201cIt also creates kind of a bullseye and it helps attackers focus their efforts on specific types of infrastructure or specific cloud platforms,\u201d Noonan said. And hackers are targeting organizations that serve in the supply chain of industries. By attacking CDK\u2019s software, for instance, hackers were able to bring the vehicle dealership industry to a standstill. Change and Ascension, large hospital chains, were not able to provide adequate care to their many branches. That gives hackers leverage to ask for larger and larger sums of money, said John Dwyer, director of security research at Binary Defense, a cybersecurity solutions firm. Though hackers have more leverage, the success of paying a ransom and a speedy recovery is elusive, experts said. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a story written on a company that successfully paid a ransom, and then quickly recovered their systems,\u201d Noonan said. Healthcare is an easy target Noonan said the issue isn\u2019t that hackers are necessarily getting more advanced, but that many organizations lack modern, up-to-date systems. Most organizations don\u2019t do incident response exercises, which is why it\u2019s taking longer to recover from these massive hacks. \u201cMuch of our critical infrastructure is way behind in terms of being prepared for recognizing cyber threats when they appear, but then more importantly, recovering from them,\u201d Noonan said. An FBI report found that ransomware attackers targeted the healthcare and public health sector the most, followed by critical manufacturing and government facilities. As systems become more interconnected, there is only so much a business can do to upkeep its cybersecurity \u2013 especially when relying on third party systems, like car dealerships do with CDK. \u201cAuto dealerships are not in the business of cybersecurity, so they aren\u2019t really up to the task of protecting that kind of a system. It\u2019s up to the vendor,\u201d Cliff Steinhauer, director of information security and engagement at National Cybersecurity Alliance said. Steinhauer also said it\u2019s a constant game of \u201ccat and mouse.\u201d \u201cEvery time we fix something, the hacker can still break it. And they only have to be right once, we have to be right every single time,\u201d Steinhauer said. Hospital attacks have surged. A nurse who works at Ascension Providence Rochester Hospital near Detroit, Michigan, previously told CNN that the ransomware attack on the networks is \u201cputting patients\u2019 lives in danger,\u201d as healthcare workers have to resort to paper charting with a load of patients to take care of. Others say healthcare is targeted because of the field\u2019s aging technology, Steven McKeon,\u00a0founder and CEO of software companies MacguyverTech and MacNerd, said in a release. This technology helps patients request prescription refills, view test results and schedule appointments, but is also more susceptible to hacks. CNN has reached out to Ascension and Change for comment. How to prevent long shutdowns Dwyer said companies can do a better job of using third-party expertise since many internal security teams are pretty small. The best examples use an internal team that is an expert on the internal systems of the organization and hire third-party cybersecurity providers to bolster their size. Organizations can also put into place systems that can look at security across their business, Liwer said. Others say there should be mandatory minimum cybersecurity requirements for publicly traded companies. Those minimum standards should be viewed like seatbelts and airbags, Noonan said \u2014 they won\u2019t prevent accidents from happening, but will better prepare companies. \u201cThere\u2019s many software companies or critical parts makers or parts of the supply chains that Americans have never heard of \u2013 these companies, the applications and the software or parts that they make until they\u2019re no longer available. There\u2019s many other CDK\u2019s out there,\u201d Noonan said.

{"id": "2024_06_26_economy_fed-stress-test-results", "text": "America\u2019s biggest banks are well positioned to survive a severe recession while continuing to lend to households and businesses, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday in its annual bank resilience test, commonly referred to as a stress test. However, banks could suffer higher losses, if a significant economic downturn were to hit now versus a year ago. As a result of the banking crisis that fueled the Great Recession, the Fed conducts stress tests to monitor and uncover potential signs of weaknesses in the financial system. The tests have taken on an extra layer of importance after the collapse of three US banks sent shockwaves through the banking system last year. The 31 banks required to take the test would lose $685 billion. That\u2019s an increase of $144 billion compared to last year\u2019s stress test results. However, fewer banks were tested last year. Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr attributed the higher collective losses to the fact that banks have taken on more risk while incurring higher expenses. The higher interest rate environment we\u2019re currently in has made it riskier, and more costly, for banks to make loans, which can depress their profitability. One area that weighed on banks more compared to last year is credit card debt, which recently hit a record high. Additionally, a higher percentage of people are making late payments. Both resulted in higher projected credit card losses. At the same time, banks\u2019 income from fees was lower, giving them less of a buffer to absorb those losses. \u201cThe goal of our test is to help to ensure that banks have enough capital to absorb losses in a highly stressful scenario. This test shows that they do,\u201d Barr said. How individual banks fared While all banks passed the tests, their performance varied significantly under the severe recession scenario. After the Fed\u2019s stress test results were released, JPMorgan Chase disclosed late Wednesday that its losses would likely be \u201cmodestly higher\u201d than the Fed had estimated. However, the nation\u2019s largest bank declined to specify how much higher the losses would be, when CNN inquired. Overall, the bank performed well in the stress test with an expected loan loss rate of 6.3%, which is below the 7.1% average across all 31 banks. Discover Financial Services suffered the biggest loan loss rate of 18.7%, followed by Capital One\u2019s 16.5% loan loss rate. Earlier this year, Capital One (COF) announced plans to acquire Discover (DFS). The acquisition hasn\u2019t been finalized and is subject to approval by the Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which are set to hold a joint meeting about the proposed acquisition next month. Discover\u2019s and Capital One\u2019s performance in the stress tests will likely cause regulators to scrutinize their financials even more closely, at a minimum. Shares of both companies were down by over 2% Thursday morning. In contrast, Charles Schwab (SCHW) suffered the smallest loan loss rate of 1.3%. Its stock moved slightly higher after the stress test results.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/economy/fed-stress-test-results/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "business"}}
