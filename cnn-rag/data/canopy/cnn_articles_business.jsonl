In a report Tuesday, the IEA projected that \u201csurging demand\u201d for EVs over the next decade was set \u201cto remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport.\u201d It expects half of all cars sold globally to be electric by 2035, up from more than one in five this year, provided charging infrastructure keeps pace. The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs. The agency\u2019s bullish long-term outlook for EVs \u2014 based on current government policies \u2014 comes just days after the world\u2019s biggest battery EV maker Tesla slashed its prices in major markets to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers. Recent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The data \u201cdoes not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars. It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday. The growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers. The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union rose almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. In a statement, Birol said: \u201cRather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.\u201d Despite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats. In the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the world\u2019s biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States. Earlier this month, Tesla posted its first annual drop in sales in nearly four years. The company\u2019s stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year. China\u2019s BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023. Automakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the \u201cpace of the transition to EVs\u2026 will hinge on affordability.\u201d In China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average. \u201cIntensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,\u201d the IEA said. \u201cGrowing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,\u201d it added. Last year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market. \u201cChina is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,\u201d Birol said. Concerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an investigation late last year into China\u2019s state support for EV makers. The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the region\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW. EV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country. By 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA. That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year. \u201cThis shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,\u201d Birol said. The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector. In addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States. Under current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA.

Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment (CSSE) revealed in a filing that it has nearly $1 billion in debt and owes millions of dollars to several entertainment companies including the BBC and Sony Pictures, plus to retailers ranging from Walmart to Walgreens. Filings show that the company took on about $325 million in debt following its purchase of Redbox in 2022 from private equity giant Apollo Global Management. The plan was to make it into an entertainment conglomerate, combining the DVD rental business with its free streaming services, like Crackle, the entertainment platform once owned by Sony. Those plans didn\u2019t pan out, hindered by dual Hollywood strikes that limited production of fresh content and the decline of people renting physical DVDs that even forced rival Netflix to quit that part of its business last year. CSSE declined to comment. Deadline previously reported that Redbox hadn\u2019t paid employees for a week, and medical benefits have been suspended. Filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy could help the company fix those issues if its plans are approved by a court in Delaware. The company\u2019s publishing arm, which produces those ubiquitous self-help books that were once a worldwide phenomenon, isn\u2019t affected by the bankruptcy filing of its entertainment unit. The number of Redbox kiosks has grown to about 34,000 across the US, largely located at grocery and drug stores.

{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices", "text": "Actress Judy Garland never recorded her voice to read an audiobook of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but you\u2019ll soon be able to hear her rendition of the children\u2019s novel that inspired the movie nonetheless. Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

The hotel announced in May it would be closing. Following its closure, the 3,000-room resort will undergo a three-year renovation that will wipe away any markings of the Mirage and its tropical theme.

The volcano will be destroyed to make space for new rooms. Opened in 1989 by casino mogul Steve Wynn, the Mirage ushered in a era of luxe resorts for the Strip and was the first resort to have a sidewalk attraction \u2013 the volcano. That prompted the Bellagio and Venetian to imitate the Mirage with its dancing fountains and canals. Architects told CNN affiliate KSNV-TV that the tropical design created by Wynn was meant to resemble an oasis in the chaotic Las Vegas Strip. \u201cNowhere in Las Vegas before you would walk in and there would be craps tables there or there would be a small lobby and then there would be a casino but in this particular facility we said \u2018no you are not in a casino you are in this beautiful tropical engineered place that made you feel good about yourself\u2019 and that is what it was for so many years,\u201d Mirage architect Paul Steelman told the NBC station.

The July 3 interview\u00a0with\u00a0WAUK-AM\u00a0host Earl Ingram\u00a0was one of Biden\u2019s first media engagements following his poor performance at the\u00a0June 27\u00a0CNN Presidential Debate. The revelations of the requested edits come as the press corps, frustrated by how the White House has handled their questions about Biden\u2019s health and acuity, is about to face Biden for the first time since the debate at a press conference Thursday during the NATO summit. On Thursday, Civic Media, a Wisconsin-based radio network, posted the edited clips and the entire unedited interview on its website. The edited clips, it said, included Biden saying: \u201c\u2026and in addition to that, I have more Blacks in my administration than any other president, all other presidents combined, and in major positions, cabinet positions.\u201d Another clip included the removal of a reference to former President Donald Trump\u2019s call for the death penalty for the so-called Central Park Five. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they even call for their hanging or not, but he\u2013but they said (\u2026) convicted of murder,\u201d Biden said.

Eight years after its publication, Vance\u2019s book has found its way back\u00a0onto the bestseller\u00a0lists, thanks to his appointment as Donald Trump\u2019s running mate. Less than 24 hours after Trump announced Vance was his vice-presidential\u00a0pick, \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d shot to the top of Amazon\u2019s\u00a0bestselling\u00a0books. On Tuesday, the 2020 film adaptation of \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d starring Glenn Close and Amy Adams,\u00a0was the 6th\u00a0most-watched movie on Netflix\u2019s Top 10 in the US, as seen on the streamer\u2019s platform. Viewership of \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d increased by 1,179% on Netflix compared to the day before Vance\u2019s VP bid,\u00a0according to research from Luminate,\u00a0which adds that the film was watched for 19.2 million minutes on Monday, jumping from the 1.5 million minutes the movie was watched on Sunday when rumors were swirling of Vance\u2019s appointment. When the \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d film first debuted, it launched to mostly negative reviews and was largely panned by critics, though Close and Adams received praise for their performances portraying Vance\u2019s grandmother and mother,\u00a0respectively,\u00a0as well as the actor Gabriel Basso, who played a younger version of Vance. Close notably was nominated for \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d at both the Oscars and the\u00a0Razzie Awards, which is the ceremony that infamously honors the worst in cinema every year. \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d chronicles Vance\u2019s childhood in Appalachia, which he wrote was plagued with poverty, abuse and his mother\u2019s addiction. At the time of \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u2019s\u201d release, the book was\u00a0widely discussed\u00a0as an explanation\u00a0for\u00a0Trump\u2019s rise among the White working class.

That\u2019s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets. A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year \u2014 the exact date has yet to be confirmed \u2014 carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon\u2019s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth. \u201cThe first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,\u201d Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation. The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia\u2019s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice. One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice. Images of ice \u2014 transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network \u2014 would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon. For NASA\u2019s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable. Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund \u2014 especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated. \u201cBeing able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis \u2014 as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,\u201d said Engelund. \u201cEventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.\u201d It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth\u2019s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing \ufeffspace colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth. NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy. Bell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the \u201cframework for the lunar economy.\u201d \u201cA future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,\u201d Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN. \u201cThis includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.\u201d There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too. If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth \u2014 such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms. \u201cEspecially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,\u201d Klein said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/tech/nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_business_jd-vance-populist-pro-worker", "text": "There\u2019s a popular idea in political discourse known as the horseshoe theory. The idea is that if you map ideologies on a horseshoe-shaped spectrum, the far right and the far left are actually more closely aligned than the centrists on either side. It\u2019s not exactly a serious academic theory, but it can be a useful image when party orthodoxies are going through the kind of upheaval that we\u2019ve seen, particularly on the American right, over the past decade. And nowhere is that upheaval more apparent than in the ascendancy of Ohio Republican Sen. JD Vance, the self-styled Appalachia populist \u2014 with a Yale law degree and a deep rolodex of Silicon Valley billionaire supporters \u2014 who is now running to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice president. Vance, who is 39, is widely viewed as the vanguard of a Millennial far right that ostensibly champions blue-collar workers and chastises greedy executives (a view that Democrats and labor advocates dispute, but more on that in a moment). And he has repeatedly run afoul of the Reagan-era Republican dogma that has long made the party popular with deep-pocketed business leaders. Vance caught flak from Republicans earlier this year for complimenting Biden\u2019s top antitrust crusader, FTC chair Lina Khan. (She\u2019s \u201cone of the few people in the Biden administration that I think is doing a pretty good job,\u201d Vance said at a conference in February.) Vance has even teamed up with Wall Street\u2019s No. 1 nemesis, Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, on legislation that would crack down on big banks. Just last month, Vance himself alluded to the horseshoe-y evolution of his views, telling the New York Times\u2019 Ross Douthat: \u201cThe people on the left, I would say, whose politics I\u2019m open to \u2014 it\u2019s the Bernie Bros.\u201d Vance isn\u2019t alone in this newly business-hostile wing of the GOP. Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley is another young buck (44 is the new 24 in Congress) who\u2019s all-in on Trump and positioning himself as an advocate for workers. Last month, Hawley stood out \u2013 even among Democrats \u2013 when he publicly shamed Boeing\u2019s CEO for taking a huge pay raise while stiffing the rank and file. Investors and industry moguls aren\u2019t loving those optics for the Trump ticket. \u201cFor many business leaders, to know Vance is not to love him,\u201d wrote a group of researchers from the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute in Time magazine on Tuesday. \u201cMany of Vance\u2019s economic policy stances amount to an American\u00a0CEO\u2019s worst nightmare; a smorgasbord of populist promises which will expand government\u2019s reach into the economy, undermine global confidence, and subvert free markets.\u201d Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch and hedge fund pioneer Ken Griffin were reportedly part of that anti-Vance chorus, according to the Washington Post.

Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing.

The French group \u2014 which owns Absolut Vodka, Jameson Whiskey, Olmeca Tequila and Beefeater Gin \u2014 announced the sale of seven wineries in Australia, New Zealand and Spain Wednesday, saying it would allow the company to direct more resources to its premium spirits and champagne brands, which \u201cdrive the growth of its business.\u201d The sale to Australian Wine Holdco Limited, a consortium of international investors, will see Pernod Ricard offload 10 wine brands: Jacob\u2019s Creek, Orlando, St Hugo, Stoneleigh, Brancott Estate, Church Road, Campo Viejo, Ysios, Tarsus, and Azpilicueta. No financial details were disclosed. The deal comes after wine consumption globally hit a 27-year low last year, according to an estimate by the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV), an industry group. Pernod Ricard reported a 7% fall in sales for the wine brands it plans to sell in the first quarter of this year, mainly as a result of a decline in popularity of Jacob\u2019s Creek in India and Campo Viejo in the US. Wine drinking has been on a steady downward trajectory since 2018, driven by a decrease in consumption in China and as high inflation has eroded disposable incomes worldwide. Consumers have also been opting for beer and spirits instead, or choosing to forego alcohol altogether due to health considerations. \u201cThe divestment (by Pernod Ricard) makes sense as the segment has been underperforming for a while now and the global wine market is still challenging,\u201d Sarah Barrett, the executive editor of Wine & Spirits Daily, a US-based trade publication, told CNN. Barrett said the sale followed a \u201cwider trend\u201d of large distillers refocusing their portfolios on premium spirits, pointing to Diageo\u2019s sale of its wine business in 2015 to Treasury Wine Estates. Pernod Ricard is also doubling down on American whiskey. The group announced plans last week for a new US-based company, North American Distillers, to further support its American whiskey portfolio, which includes Jefferson\u2019s and Rabbit Hole. \u201cAmerican whiskey is a dynamic spirits category, and our portfolio shows immense potential for future growth,\u201d Richard Black, who will helm the new specialized business, said in a statement at the time. Falling wine consumption globally has collided with severe pressures on wine production, forcing many vineyards in Europe to close their doors. Last year, wine production hit its lowest level since 1961, according to the OIV, as extreme weather and fungal disease hammered vineyards. Waning appetite for wine worldwide has also hit Australia hard, where millions of vines are being destroyed in response to overproduction that has crushed grape prices, threatening the livelihoods of growers and wine makers.

{"id": "2024_07_17_business_hsbc-new-ceo-elhedery", "text": "HSBC has appointed its Chief Financial Officer Georges Elhedery as its next CEO, the bank said Wednesday. Lebanon-born Elhedery, 50, who becomes\u00a0the bank\u2019s third chief executive in less than eight years, will replace outgoing head Noel Quinn from September 2. While the 160-year-old lender did consider external candidates, it has traditionally appointed its CEO from within. \u201cFor most investors, continuity is essential, especially after the battles\u00a0HSBC\u2019s board has been through in recent years, to persuade shareholders that its strategy is right,\u201d said Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Elhedery\u2019s appointment comes as HSBC (HSBC) tries to shift from restructuring to growth, at a time when helpful interest rate hikes may have peaked and geopolitical tensions simmer. Iain Pyle, senior investment director at\u00a0HSBC\u00a0shareholder abrdn, said Elhedery had made a good impression on the market over his 18 months as finance chief and was \u201ca clear communicator.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a continuity appointment, but a strong candidate and I think will be taken well today,\u201d he said. HSBC\u00a0defeated a shareholder resolution last year backed by Chinese insurance giant Ping An and other Hong Kong-based shareholders who were seeking a\u00a0spin-off\u00a0of its lucrative Asia business. Ping An, which owns 8.9% of\u00a0HSBC\u00a0according to LSEG data, declined to comment on Elhedery\u2019s appointment. Elhedery\u00a0began his career in banking as a trader before joining\u00a0HSBC\u00a0in 2005. In October 2022, he was unexpectedly appointed CFO just weeks after returning from a sabbatical. It was a move that groomed him for the top job. Quinn, who led\u00a0HSBC\u00a0for five years, will remain CEO until Elhedery starts in the role. At the time of his surprise exit announcement in April, he said he wanted a better work-life balance and planned to pursue a portfolio career. Quinn oversaw a raft of asset sales, navigated the pandemic and a push by rebel investors to break up the bank, guiding the lender to record profit. Stanley Tsai, founder of Hong Kong-based investment advisory firm Antler Capital, said he wasn\u2019t surprised by the choice. \u201cSome investors might\u2019ve wanted someone with more direct Asia experience, especially with the Greater China portfolio, but it\u2019s always been the non-Asia business that has presented the most overwhelming challenges,\u201d he said. That said,\u00a0HSBC\u00a0is highly sensitive to souring relations between China and the West, and\u00a0delivering on growth ambitions\u00a0in Asia will be challenging at a time when China\u2019s economic growth is slowing and the bank risks being embroiled in geopolitical tensions. Elhedery will also have to manage\u00a0HSBC\u2019s exposure to China\u2019s lingering bad loans crisis, which triggered a shock $3 billion charge last February on the bank\u2019s stake in China\u2019s Bank of Communications. He has relatively little direct work experience in Asia, having spent the bulk of his\u00a0HSBC\u00a0career in roles across its Middle East and Africa businesses. HSBC\u00a0said it will announce Elhedery\u2019s successor as Group CFO in due course.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/business/hsbc-new-ceo-elhedery/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_success_saving-under-high-interest-rates", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is an updated version of an article that originally ran on May 1. As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged for its seventh meeting in a row on Wednesday. People carrying variable-rate debt like credit cards and those seeking a loan won\u2019t be happy given that the Fed\u2019s rate, which directly and indirectly affects consumers\u2019 borrowing costs, remains at a 23-year high. Those rates will likely stay high for a while. At this point, only one cut is seen as likely before the end of the year, according to US central bankers\u2019 latest summary of economic projections. But whenever the cuts start, they may be small. \u201cAbsent a complete about-face from the economy, interest rates aren\u2019t likely to come down soon enough, or fast enough, to provide meaningful relief to borrowers. Utilize zero-percent credit card balance transfer offers, shop around for lower fixed-rate personal loans and home equity loans, and channel as much income as possible toward paying down this debt as quickly as possible,\u201d said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com\u2019s chief financial analyst. But the Fed\u2019s decision leaves savers, once again, in the catbird seat when it comes to making money on their money. \u201cSavers are enjoying the best returns on savings accounts and CDs in more than 15 years, with the most competitive offers outpacing inflation. In addition, these conditions are poised to persist for the foreseeable future,\u201d McBride said. Online high-yield savings accounts The best bang for your savings can still be had in online high-yield savings accounts at FDIC-insured banks, which yield way more than today\u2019s 0.58% overall average savings rate. As of June 11, the average online savings account rate was 4.40%, according to DepositAccounts.com. And many online high-yield accounts continue to offer rates of 5% or more. Say you have $10,000 in savings. If you leave it parked in a regular savings account at 0.5%, you\u2019ll get $50 in interest for a year. If you put it instead in a 5% high-yield account, you\u2019ll get $500. A high-yield savings account is the best place to park money you\u2019ll need to cover emergencies as well as anticipated large expenses that you have to pay in the next three months to a year. As with any savings account, banks can lower the rate they offer \u2014 also known as the APY \u2014 at any time. And you can be sure they will do just that when the Fed looks like it will finally start cutting rates, McBride said. But, he added, since rates are likely to be cut in small increments, online high-yield savings accounts may continue to offer inflation-beating returns for some time. \u201cThey will still offer the best way to preserve your [money\u2019s] buying power,\u201d McBride said. Money market accounts and money market funds Money market deposit accounts and money market mutual funds are generating yields competitive with the best high-yield savings accounts. But there are important differences. Money market deposit accounts are bank products. So, assuming your bank is FDIC insured, your account is too. (Or, if your account is at a federally backed credit union, your money will be\u00a0insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.) As with high-yield accounts, you may get the best deals at an online bank. But money market accounts may have a higher minimum deposit requirement than a high-yield account. Money market funds, by contrast, are an investment product \u2014 they generate return by investing in short-term, low-risk debt instruments and are currently yielding an average of 5.12%, according to the Crane 100 Money Fund Index. Such funds are a good place to park cash you have in your brokerage account that you may want to use at some point to buy equities or bonds, McBride said. Money market funds are not FDIC-insured, but any brokerage you use should be insured by the\u00a0Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which\u00a0covers your funds up to a limit if your brokerage ever goes under. Certificates of deposit CDs are still a great place to park any money you can leave untouched for a fixed\u00a0period of time \u2014 anywhere from a few months to five years or longer. As of June 11, the average rate was 4.971% on an online one-year CD, and 3.815% on a five-year CD, according to DepositAccounts.com. While your brick-and-mortar bank may offer a CD at a good rate, you may get a better one shopping around. The easiest way to do that without having to set up an additional account at another bank is to shop for CDs through your online brokerage, which is likely to offer a wide array of CDs from many different banks. At Schwab.com, for instance, CDs on offer ranging in duration from three months all the way up to 10 years offered average annual returns over 5%, with most ranging between 5.30% and 5.45%. The highest annual average was 5.56% for a three-month CD. If you have to withdraw money before the end of a CD\u2019s term, you can always get all of your principal back but may forfeit some of the interest earned as an early withdrawal penalty. Treasury bills and notes Beyond deposit accounts, investing in short-term Treasury bills and intermediate-term Treasury notes has been another way to earn a competitive return with virtually no risk since Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Treasury bills come in six different maturities: 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 13 weeks, 17 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks. Treasury notes mature in two, three, five, seven or 10 years. \u201cAs long as the Fed holds its rate in the 5.25% to 5.5% range, we expect most Treasury bill yields to hover around 5.25% as well,\u201d said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. But, Martin added, \u201cWhile the timing of rate cuts has been pushed back, we still expect them to arrive later this year, and investors in short-term investments would likely face reinvestment risk.\u201d That\u2019s why he suggests investors consider buying some intermediate-term investments now before rates are cut if they want to lock in a higher yield for some of their money, such as Treasury notes maturing in the next four to 10 years. On Wednesday, yields on Treasury bills were north of 5% and yields on Treasury notes were north of 4%, according to Schwab.com. When deciding whether it makes sense to invest in a CD or a Treasury for the same duration, you might opt for the Treasury if you live in a high-tax state, McBride suggested, since interest on Treasuries is\u00a0exempt from state and local taxes. In all instances, the easiest way to purchase Treasuries and other bonds is to do so through your brokerage account.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/success/saving-under-high-interest-rates/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_success_buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage", "text": "Moving somewhere new when you retire isn\u2019t uncommon. But deciding whether to take out a new mortgage to buy a home is a big deal. Much of your financial life is changing as you transition from a steady paycheck to a mix of fixed and variable income and a new lifestyle. So adding a large debt to the picture isn\u2019t an easy call. That\u2019s especially true now that mortgage rates hover around 7% and home prices keep rising. \u201cAny time you take on debt, you increase risk in your situation,\u201d said Illinois-based certified financial planner Jim Stork. More than a third (35%) of homebuyers last year were between the ages of 59 and 98, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Within that group, a majority financed their purchases. Whether taking out a new mortgage makes sense for you depends on a lot of factors, including how to prove to a lender that you\u2019re a good credit risk, plus your feelings about the debt and the ongoing cost of maintaining a home. To get a mortgage, your age won\u2019t be a factor, but your income will be If you\u2019re concerned that you may be less attractive to a mortgage banker because you\u2019ve hit retirement age, know that it is illegal to discriminate against anyone applying for a mortgage based on their age. Lenders\u2019 chief focus will be on your ability to repay your mortgage with your various sources of non-paycheck income. \u201cWhen you qualify for a mortgage, it\u2019s all based on your income,\u201d said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage. That, and of course any debt you have that will soak up your income, but we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. The income sources that lenders consider, absent a regular paycheck, include: Social Security benefits, pension or annuity income, spousal benefits, disability payments, interest and dividends and your 401(k) or IRA. If a portion of your income is not subject to tax, the lender may treat it as worth 25% more. Fannie Mae offers this example: Say 15% of a $1,500 monthly Social Security benefit is tax free. That means $225 of it will not be subject to tax ($1,500 x 15%). And 25% of that amount comes to $56 ($225 x 25%). So that $56 can be added to a person\u2019s qualifying Social Security income amount ($1,500 + $56 = $1,556). If you want to use your nest egg, different methods can be used to calculate how much income it would provide. There is the asset depletion method in which your eligible assets are divided by your loan term. In the case of a 30-year mortgage, that would be 360 months. If your IRA is worth $700,000, that translates into $1,944 per month ($700,000/360). \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to take the money out \u2014 but you can use your assets [to qualify for a mortgage] as if you were going to take the distribution,\u201d Cohn said. Another option: If you are at least 59-1/2, you can start taking monthly distributions from an IRA without penalty \u2014 or a 401(k) if your plan rules permit \u2014 and the lender will count that as income so long as you show that you have sufficient funds in the account to keep taking that same monthly distribution for three years. Once you close on your home, Cohn said, you can reduce or stop taking distributions if you choose. That assumes you are not yet in your 70s when the IRS requires you to start taking minimum distributions, said Mark Luscombe, a principal analyst at Wolters, Kluwer Tax & Accounting. Burdened by debt? Lenders will also assess your debt-to-income ratio, because no matter how much income you have, the big question is how much of it will be consumed by your debts. The debt portion is composed of your expected mortgage payment plus any credit card, student loan, car loan or other outstanding debt you may have. Generally speaking, for conventional loans your DTI ratio can be up to 50%, Cohen said. That ratio falls to between 43% and 45% if you\u2019re taking out a jumbo loan, she added. A jumbo loan exceeds the conforming loan limits in the area you want to buy. But ideally your debt level will fall well below these top limits, both for the lender\u2019s sake and yours. And, of course, the higher your credit score, the better the interest rate you can get on a mortgage. What you should consider before taking out a mortgage Even before seeking a mortgage, get a good grasp on your expected monthly income and expenses in retirement. Compared to pre-retirement earnings, \u201cMost (new retirees) see a decrease in income,\u201d said certified financial planner Lori Trawinski, director of finance and employment at AARP. While some expenses may also decline \u2014 e.g., work-related costs like commuting \u2014 others may increase over time, Trawinski said, like medical costs, property taxes, home insurance and utilities. Of course, you can downsize and move to a lower-cost area. But if you stay near where you lived during your career, your expenses are likely to rise over time. Also, Trawinski noted, if you\u2019re married, consider what will happen to your household income when one spouse dies. This will help you assess your future comfort level in carrying a mortgage. \u201cPeople often fail to plan for the death of a spouse. You can take a big hit to your income when that happens,\u201d she said. If you do move to a new state or region, weigh renting first. You can get a better sense of the cost of living in the area and decide whether it\u2019s a good fit for you. As Stork put it, \u201cFlorida in August is not as fun as Florida in January.\u201d How much are you really willing to take on? All the usual financial decisions that go into homebuying apply no matter your age. But, in retirement especially, you don\u2019t want to take on more debt than necessary, since the cost of a mortgage is fixed, but the returns on your investments, the housing market and your health needs are variable. At the very least, Stork said, consider whether you can put enough money down \u2014 at least 20% \u2014 to avoid having to pay private mortgage insurance. Beyond that, consider whether you feel comfortable keeping up \u2014 and paying for \u2014 maintenance on a home. Maintenance might amount to 2% a year of your home\u2019s value, Stork said. That amounts to $10,000 a year on a $500,000 home. Maintenance is essential in preserving the value of your house should you ever decide to sell. How would your mortgage interest rate compare to a reasonable rate of return on your investments? The decision to get a mortgage was a lot easier for retirees when rates were historically low \u2014 roughly 3% \u2014 and their nest eggs were earning a lot more. \u201cBut at today\u2019s rates it\u2019s a much harder calculation,\u201d Stork said. This is especially the case if you\u2019re a very conservative investor. \u201cIf your CDs are earning 4% and a mortgage would cost you 7%, you will lose money every day on that decision,\u201d Stork explained. To get the truest reading on what makes financial sense, compare mortgage expenses to your investment returns on an after-tax basis, Stork noted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/success/buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech.

Since the debate, the journalists tasked with covering the White House have been imploring the president\u2019s communications team \u2013 who said the debate was just a \u201cbad night\u201d \u2013 to prove it, allowing him to take questions directly from the press. \u201cThis is a period of time here where the public is trying to understand what happened,\u201d NBC\u2019s Kelly O\u2019Donnell said on July 2. \u201cAnd the president could help to answer that by engaging with us in an unscripted way right now.\u201d In the weeks since the debate, a media frenzy has erupted around Biden, with the White House and Biden campaign\u00a0coming under intense scrutiny for any sign that aides are attempting to shield the president or potentially cover up any of his missteps that might show a decline. The\u00a0discontent has been on full display in the White House briefing room, where reporters have openly sparred with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, particularly over the president\u2019s medical history. Amid pushback from the press, the White House has been forced to revisit answers to some questions. CBS News senior White House correspondent\u00a0Ed O\u2019Keefe laid it all out during a dust-up with Jean-Pierre on Monday. \u201cWell, we\u2019re a little miffed around here about how information has been shared with the press corps,\u201d he\u00a0said.\u00a0\u201cYou answer it incorrectly and then have to come back and clean it up a few days later.\u201d \u201cNo, wait a minute,\u201d Jean-Pierre replied. \u201cCalm \u2014 Ed, please.\u00a0A little respect here, please.\u201d Jean-Pierre said she and the White House communications staff have been doing \u201cour best in this briefing to provide the information that we have.\u201d \u201cI will be the first one to admit: Sometimes I get it wrong. At least I admit that,\u201d she added. But the exchange was symbolic of the growing distrust between the White House communications team and the press corps, which has bristled over\u00a0what they perceive to be\u00a0a lack of transparency and access to Biden, who has conducted fewer press conferences than his recent predecessors. The following day, Jean-Pierre was asked about a neurologist\u2019s visit to the White House earlier this year, which she denied had been related to the president. But later that evening, Jean-Pierre\u00a0issued a statement\u00a0correcting her comments. \u201cThis is the second time in less than a week where the briefing had prompted a need for later clarification on questions about the president\u2019s health,\u201d Associated Press White House reporter Seung Min Kim said in the briefing room Tuesday. It turned out the neurologists\u2019 visits were not all related to the president, after a breathless news cycle that, at times, implied the president was being treated for Parkinson\u2019s (the White House says he is not).\u00a0But while the tense moments in the briefing room may seem to focus on small details and semantics, for the press it\u2019s about credibility. \u201cI think this is a credibility crisis writ large for the White House, and certainly as a spokesperson for the White House, this is a credibility crisis for her,\u201d one White House reporter told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the situation. \u201cIf they were answering truthfully, with a sense of fidelity to the question in a well-meaning way, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily see (those blow-ups in the briefing room),\u201d the reporter added. The reporter said the press corps has not suddenly decided \u201cto get tough\u201d on the White House in wake of the debate, noting that reporters have been frustrated with how Jean-Pierre has answered from the podium for more than a year and a half. \u201cWe saw the debate. We asked questions. The answers that we got in response to those questions were unsatisfactory,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re reporters, looking, probing when given unsatisfactory answers.\u201d In a statement to CNN, White House spokesman Andrew Bates defended Jean-Pierre, saying she \u201ctakes hard questions every day, providing thorough answers\u201d and represents President Biden \u201cwith grace and integrity.\u201d \u201cAnd she does that with respect, knowing it\u2019s the obligation of journalists to constantly ask for more information; and that if any White House press corps, in any administration, were ever satisfied they would not be doing their jobs,\u201d Bates said. \u201cWhatever disagreements she may have with reporters, she never gives anonymous quotes criticizing any of them. Instead, she keeps her office door open.\u201d Even before the debate, Biden has held fewer press conferences than his most recent predecessors. Biden has held 36 press conferences thus far in his presidency, fewer than former presidents Donald Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush at the same point in their presidencies. While the White House has countered that\u00a0Biden has held\u00a0more\u00a0off-the-cuff interactions with the press than his predecessors while traveling to events and meetings, reporters say those are nowhere near the same as an open format press conference. Bates said Biden has \u201cproudly fought for the rights of journalists in the world and spoken forcefully about the \u2018critical\u2019 role of the press in American democracy \u2013 rather than slander them as \u2018enemies of the people.\u2019 In line with those values, his team reinstated daily press briefings and works hard to be informative and factual, including by releasing more documentation on policy than at any time in American history.\u201d But a former White House staffer under President Bill Clinton told CNN that Biden\u2019s team had deployed an astute strategy to not put the president in front of the media\u00a0as often because they have to \u201cplay to his strengths, which is not a news conference.\u201d \u201cThe media\u2019s game is,\u00a0\u2018let\u2019s do a press conference, because that\u2019s the only way you can demonstrate to us.\u2019 Well, guess what? They don\u2019t need to demonstrate to the media. They need to demonstrate to the country,\u201d the former staffer said. \u201cAnd if I were advising them, I would say, play to his strengths. And if that means fixed events, that means, you know, less formal interviews, whatever it is, that\u2019s what I tell them to do.\u201d But as questions continue to swirl around Biden\u2019s mental fitness, a mounting challenge for the White House and Biden\u2019s campaign is the growing belief that the White House and campaign have not been transparent about his condition. \u201cWe are in the midst of a full-blown feeding frenzy,\u201d former CNN White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief Frank Sesno said. Sesno and former White House correspondents and officials told CNN that questions surrounding Biden\u2019s age and performance, along with how the White House is handling the issue, are legitimate and warrant scrutiny. But they cautioned that the emphasis of the reporting needs to be on how Biden has fundamentally changed over time. \u201cIf a subtext takes hold in the press corps, it\u2019s very, very difficult for a president to break out of that, and Biden is dealing with that today \u2014 that he\u2019s too old,\u201d said Kenneth Walsh, the author of \u201cThe Architects of Toxic Politics in America\u201d and a former White House correspondent for U.S. News & World Report. \u201cThat\u2019s the story that we\u2019re all focused on now, because we see evidence of it, and so it\u2019s a rather easy story to do, and it\u2019s a dramatic story, and it\u2019s valuable to keep people focused on it because we think it\u2019s important to understanding this president.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/media/white-house-press-corps-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

PepsiCo\u2019s snack unit Frito-Lay posted a dip in revenue in its second quarter Thursday after multiple quarters of price increases. Years of inflation have resulted in \u201ctighter household financial conditions,\u201d the company said in prepared remarks, so \u201cperformance across  many food categories, including snacks, has been subdued and consumers have become more value-conscious.\u201d As a result, the company is weighing some cost-cutting and boosting promotions for its portfolio of brands, which include Cheetos, Lay\u2019s, Doritos and Smartfood, among other snacks. While inflation has slowed down, American customers still haven\u2019t recovered from higher prices in everyday categories like snacks. Everyone from President Joe Biden to the Cookie Monster has complained about \u201cshrinkflation\u201d in snacks, which is when companies cut the size of their products to save on costs. Snack shoppers are responding by either buying fewer chips or going private-label. In recent months,\u00a0a slew of major retailers\u00a0have\u00a0announced price cuts. That trend could continue as consumers become more restrained, CNN previously reported. The average price of potato chips in June 2024 was $6.56; in June 2020, as the pandemic was taking off, the average price was $5.09, according to Federal Reserve data. \u201cThere is some value to be given back to consumers after three or four years of a lot of inflation,\u201d PepsiCo chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a call to investors. Certain products, like unsalted potato chips or tortilla chips, could see a \u201cvalue reset\u201d and have lower prices, Laguarta said. Laguarta said adjustments must be made for \u201ccertain consumers\u201d in parts of Frito-Lay\u2019s broad portfolio. Laguarta said the company is investing in customers looking for a deal. The company said it would offer broader price tiers, using its variety multipacks that are often cheaper per bag, as an example. It\u2019s boosting its marketing and in-store promotional placements for cheaper products. \u201cIn the US, there is clearly a consumer that is more challenged and is a consumer that is telling us that in particular parts of our portfolio, they want more value to stay with our brands,\u201d Laguarta told investors.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/business/snackers-are-tired-of-high-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_business_inflation-cpi-biden-nightcap", "text": "We did it, y\u2019all! Get the Champagne on ice and gather the townsfolk because America hath slain the beast known as inflation. (Or, at least, it\u2019s hit a turning point.) ICYMI: Last month, for the first time in four years, prices on everyday goods and services actually\u00a0fell. In other words, this June was the first time since the pandemic started that we paid less for stuff compared with the previous month. The surprise price decline is seismic news, at least among econ wonks and a narrow strata of reporters who follow this stuff with the fervor of a tween Swiftie. \u201cInflation is dead, and jobs are alive,\u201d labor economist Aaron Sojourner tells me. \u201cWe have a very good chance right now of sticking the soft landing.\u201d Huzzah! Maximum employment and price stability? Let\u2019s party. But wait \u2014 what\u2019s that I hear? Not the riotous cheers of American consumers dancing in the streets. Not a chorus of workers singing about the strongest labor market of their lifetimes, and no \u2014 I can\u2019t even pick up on the sound of what I\u2019m sure is an army of economists demanding sainthood for Jay Powell. Instead, the single best economic news of the past decade is but a murmur of chit-chat, barely audible against a clamor of politicos shouting about President Joe Biden\u2019s age. And that has got to drive the Biden campaign absolutely nuts. Bidenomics worked and no one cares For the past three years, President Biden\u2019s biggest political liabilities have been painfully obvious: his age and inflation. One those problems has more or less evaporated \u2014 inflation has been steadily cooling, from 9% to 3% on annualized basis, for the past two years. Consumers are finally expressing some optimism, if not for the economy as a whole then at least for their own personal financial situations, the stock market and cooling inflation. Of course, everyone knows intellectually that the president doesn\u2019t control the economy. But that\u2019s never stopped voters from blaming whoever\u2019s in office for, well, just about anything, and similarly no party would miss an opportunity to claim credit for an economic boom. To be sure, American households aren\u2019t suddenly going to forget the whiplash of inflation that has strained their finances. It remains true, as my colleague Alicia Wallace notes, that overall prices are a good 20% higher than they were in February 2020. (In recent history, the index would typically rise about 10% over a 54-month period, Labor Department data shows.) And nothing in economics goes in a straight line. Just 24 hours after the jaw-dropping consumer price report, Friday brought some unexpected bad news around producer prices, which rose 0.2% in June after holding flat in May. Still, Thursday should have been a day for the White House to spike the football and double down on a message that has, historically, fallen flat \u2014 that Bidenomics is working. Unfortunately, if you\u2019re in the Biden camp, age \u2014 unlike inflation \u2014 only goes one direction. Rather than doing a victory lap, Biden on Thursday was preparing for a high-stakes news conference in front of a ravenous White House press corps that focused their questions almost entirely on his fitness to lead. During the press conference, he touted the inflation numbers repeatedly, comparing the positive economic situation now to the pandemic mess he inherited when he started the job. But the press\u2019 questions focused mostly on his verbal slipups and chances of beating former President Donald Trump. Bottom line: Thursday\u2019s inflation report is an indisputably positive development that could put some wind in the sails of a Democratic campaign \u2014 a powerful blow against the fictional Republican narrative about a US economy in the gutter. The White House can finally cross out \u201cinflation\u201d on its list of presidential liabilities. But as long as Biden\u2019s age dominates the conversation, it\u2019ll just be the econ nerds sipping Champagne alone.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/business/inflation-cpi-biden-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

The refinery, know as ExxonMobil\u2019s Joliet Refinery, is located in neighboring Channahon, Illinois. Channahon Fire Chief John Petrakis told CNN Wednesday that the tornado was just on the other side of Interstate 55 from the refinery. Gasoline futures for the Chicago region jumped about 11 cents a gallon in trading Tuesday, Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates, told CNN. That came even as other gasoline future prices fell slightly nationwide. The power outage at the refinery \u201cis a significant event,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are three refineries in the Chicagoland area: BP (in Whiting Indiana) with a capacity of 440,000 barrels per day, ExxonMobil Joliet at 275,000 and Citgo in Lemont Illinois at 194,000,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen one of these refineries shuts, there is little to no cushion of extra supply in the area.\u201d Wholesale futures for Chicago were up another 4 cents a gallon in Wednesday trading, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the OPIS. He said that oil prices have been relatively weak this summer nationally, with even Hurricane Beryl\u2019s hit on the Houston area not being enough to lift prices. But this refinery is major enough to have a impact on local prices. The line of storms that hit the area Monday night produced 11 tornadoes in the greater Chicago area, including the one that hit Channahon, according to the National Weather Service. It will take a few days to return the Joliet refinery to normal production, assuming no damage occurred beyond the power outage, Lipow said. ExxonMobil has yet to reply to questions about damage or its operational plans. If damage delays a return of production, gasoline will need to be shipped up from the Gulf Coast via pipeline which will take a couple of weeks to get to the Chicago market, Lipow said. Lipow said he expects prices will start to rise at Chicago stations almost immediately.

{"id": "press-corps-biden-news-conference", "text": "For nearly an hour Thursday evening,\u00a0President Joe Biden\u00a0went toe-to-toe with the press corps \u2014 and, perhaps against the wishes of some in his own party, managed to exit the high stakes showdown mostly unscathed. Fielding a barrage of tough questions, Biden addressed 11 outlets during his closely watched dance with the news media, reiterating\u00a0again\u00a0and\u00a0again\u00a0that he plans to stay in the 2024 race, while also displaying an impressive command of complex foreign policy matters. Stylistically, Biden wasn\u2019t without flaws. After introducing\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0as\u00a0Vladimir Putin\u00a0earlier in the day, Biden accidentally referred to\u00a0Vice President Kamala Harris\u00a0as\u00a0Donald Trump. And throughout the affair, the 81-year-old president mostly spoke in his now trademark low and monotone voice. But, unquestionably, the Biden that showed up at the conclusion of the\u00a0NATO summit was not the same Biden that walked onstage at the\u00a0CNN\u00a0presidential debate two weeks ago. Did he ace Thursday\u2019s test? Probably not. But did he score a passing grade? Most definitely. Interest in Biden\u2019s face-off with the news media had been steadily growing all week as lawmakers and other high-profile figures in the\u00a0Democratic Party\u00a0called for him to step aside and abandon his bid for a second term. Since his disastrous debate with Trump, Biden had not appeared unscripted at a public event for such a lengthy period of time. And, stepping further back, Biden had not held a solo press conference since November, making Thursday\u2019s his first of 2024. The press was eager for an opportunity to confront Biden. As CNN\u2019s\u00a0Hadas Gold\u00a0reported Thursday, journalists who cover the White House were walking into the news conference with a significant amount of pent up frustration. Reporters have felt stonewalled and misled by the White House. They had been earnestly seeking a forum in which they could directly question Biden about his fitness for office and desires to seek an additional four years. The truth is that, despite their pointed questions, reporters extracted little from Biden on Thursday evening. He stayed on message and was able to keep up with the unrelenting stream of queries directed his way. Outside his early flub referring to Harris as Trump, Biden showed a deep understanding of the issues. It was not the senile, dementia-plagued man that has been at times portrayed to the American public. As\u00a0Bill Carter, the veteran media critic, pointed out on\u00a0X, it\u2019s curious why Biden did not actually hold such a press conference in the immediate wake of his poor debate performance to assuage concerns and stop the bleeding sooner. It would have mattered a lot more then. But at this late stage, will it stop naysayers, who have been steadily gaining momentum, from calling on him to withdraw from the race? CNN\u2019s Manu Raju\u00a0reported after the press conference that it is unlikely to. Indeed,\u00a0Rep. Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat on the\u00a0House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement after the news conference saying he believed Biden should drop out of the race. But it could get a lot worse.\u00a0CBS News\u2019 Margaret Brennan\u00a0reported that four Democratic sources told her \u201cthey expect dozens of Democratic lawmakers over the next 48 hours to issue statements\u201d calling on Biden to step aside. And\u00a0CNN\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere\u00a0and\u00a0Jeff Zeleny\u00a0reported that\u00a0Barack Obama\u00a0and\u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u00a0have been speaking about their concerns with Biden\u2019s campaign. In other words, at this juncture, while the performance Biden delivered at the much-hyped news conference was strong, it may simply be too late.

In a statement Wednesday, the authority said Armani and Dior \u201cmay have issued untrue statements about their ethics and social responsibility, in particular with regard to working conditions and compliance with the law by their suppliers.\u201d The investigation is focused on some firms within the Armani Group and some within the LVMH-owned Dior Group, the authority said, adding that inspections had been carried out at these firms\u2019 premises Tuesday. The firms are being investigated for possible \u201cunlawful\u201d conduct in the marketing and sale of clothes and accessories, in violation of Italy\u2019s Consumer Code, it noted. Breaches of the code can result in fines of up to \u20ac10 million ($10.9 million). Many mainstream fashion brands have long faced allegations of exploitative working conditions in their supply chains. But increased scrutiny of luxury brands stands out because it challenges perceptions that high prices, Europe-based suppliers and superior artisanship mean garments are produced ethically. Italy\u2019s competition authority said Armani and Dior \u201cemphasized craftmanship and quality,\u201d while using supplies from factories \u201cemploying workers who would receive inadequate wages.\u201d In some cases, workers are also forced to work long hours under \u201cinadequate health and safety conditions.\u201d These practices contrast with \u201cboasted levels of production excellence\u201d by the two groups, it noted. The probe comes after Milan prosecutors accused several Chinese-owned firms in Italy, producing luxury goods for\u00a0Dior and Armani, of systematically abusing their employees, Reuters reported.

Armani has denied the allegations levied by the competition authority, but said it would cooperate with the latest investigation. \u201cThe companies involved are fully committed to (cooperating) with the authorities (but) believe that the allegations have no merit and are confident of a positive result following the investigation,\u201d the group told CNN in a statement.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/business/armani-dior-workers-italy-probe/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

Watson, a former cable news anchor and investment banker, and\u00a0Ozy\u00a0were each convicted of securities fraud conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy, while Watson was also convicted of identity theft. Both had pleaded not guilty. Federal prosecutors said Watson and his California-based news and entertainment company\u00a0falsified information about\u00a0Ozy\u2019s finances and audience size, fabricated contracts and inflated earnings projections to court investors. Founded in 2013,\u00a0Ozy\u00a0imploded in 2021 after news reports questioned its audience numbers and revealed that a top executive had impersonated a YouTube executive during a call with Goldman Sachs\u00a0bankers in which he claimed the streaming site agreed to pay for exclusive rights to an\u00a0Ozy\u00a0show. Prosecutors said Watson could face about 24 to 29 years in prison under recommended federal sentencing guidelines, including a mandatory two years for identity theft.\u00a0His sentencing is set for Nov. 18. \u201cOzy\u00a0Media ultimately collapsed under the weight of Watson\u2019s dishonest schemes and with today\u2019s verdict, Watson himself has been held accountable for his brazen crimes,\u201d Brooklyn US Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement. Lawyers for Watson and\u00a0Ozy\u00a0did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Watson\u2019s lawyer had told jurors that Watson was betrayed by deputies who acted on their own and kept him in the dark about their wrongdoing. The verdict follows\u00a0a six-week trial that featured testimony\u00a0by two former Watson deputies, who pleaded guilty to fraud. They told jurors they conspired with Watson to hide\u00a0Ozy\u2019s crippling debt, meager cash reserves and slow growth. Ozy\u00a0folded shortly after The New York Times reported on former chief operating officer Samir Rao\u2019s impersonation of the YouTube executive. Watson denied involvement in the incident, though prosecutors said contemporaneous chat logs show he coached Rao on what to say. The YouTube executive Alex Piper and Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified for the government, saying they never had deals with\u00a0Ozy\u00a0or considered buying it at any price, contrary to Watson\u2019s claims to investors. Prosecutors said Watson also assured investors that\u00a0Ozy\u00a0was thriving even as its cash reserves sank to $19,000 in 2018\u00a0and\u00a0it struggled to pay rent, wages and other basic expenses. Watson testified for several days in his own defense. He said prosecutors\u2019 view of\u00a0Ozy\u2019s finances was simplistic and failed to appreciate the nuances of media industry dealmaking. He also blamed negative press coverage for\u00a0Ozy\u2019s demise. During cross-examination, Watson was at times evasive about the inconsistent revenue figures\u00a0Ozy\u00a0provided to investors. He also declined a prosecutor\u2019s request to break down\u00a0Ozy\u2019s annual revenue in cash rather than future potential earnings. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way I\u2019ve thought about it before and that\u2019s not the way our investors thought about it,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/media/ozy-media-carlos-watson-fraud-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_success_gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy", "text": "Employees\u2019 negative daily emotions and lack of well-being can ultimately hurt worker engagement \u2013 and the economy, according to a new report released this week. Gallup, in its \u201cState of the Global Workplace,\u201d estimates that low employee engagement costs the global economy $8.9 trillion, or 9% of global GDP. The report includes findings from its latest annual World Poll, which surveyed 128,278 employees in more than 140 countries last year. That poll found that roughly 20% of workers globally reported feeling lonely, angry or sad on a daily basis. And 41% on average say they feel stress. Those most likely to say they feel lonely were younger workers (22%), employees who worked remotely full-time (25%) and those who felt most disengaged on the job (31%). While work isn\u2019t always the cause of a person\u2019s negative daily emotions, employers should still be concerned. That\u2019s because work can either improve or worsen employees\u2019 well-being. On the one hand,\u00a0the Gallup report noted,\u00a0\u201cwhen employees find their work and work relationships meaningful, employment is associated with high levels of daily enjoyment and low levels of all negative daily emotions. Notably, half of employees who are engaged at work are thriving in life overall.\u201d On the other, researchers found that being disengaged at work can negatively affect a person\u2019s wellbeing as much as \u2014 or more than \u2014 not having a job at all. \u201cEmployees who dislike their jobs tend to have high levels of daily stress and worry, as well as elevated levels of all other negative emotions,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOn many wellbeing items (stress, anger, worry, loneliness), being actively disengaged at work is equivalent to or worse than being unemployed.\u201d Engaged managers help workers thrive The poll found that last year only 23% of employees were engaged at work, unchanged from the year prior. Gallup defines an engaged employee as someone \u201chighly involved in and enthusiastic about their work and workplace. They are psychological \u2018owners,\u2019 drive performance and innovation, and move the organization forward.\u201d But those who said they were not engaged rose by 3 percentage points to 62%. These are employees characterized as \u201cpsychologically unattached to their work and company. Because their engagement needs are not being fully met, they are putting time but not energy or passion into their work.\u201d Engagement levels are highest in so-called \u201cbest practice\u201d organizations, where three-fourths of managers on average are engaged as well as seven in 10 non-managers, Gallup said. Their best practices include leaders\u2019 emphasizing well-being at work and in life; and putting a high priority on manager hiring and development. The manager piece of the equation is especially crucial. \u201c[W]hen managers are engaged, employees are more likely to be engaged,\u201d the report said. And, it added, \u201chigh-engagement business units are likely to see significantly higher employee wellbeing \u2014 as well as higher productivity, profitability and sales \u2014 than low-engagement teams.\u201d Where the most and least stressed workers are Engagement and well-being results varied in each of the 10 regions covered by Gallup\u2019s poll. The report noted that the United States and Canada, for example, showed the highest percentage of engaged employees (33%) among all the regions studied; and the third highest percentage of thriving employees (53%), behind Australia and New Zealand (60%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (54%). But the US and Canada also ranked second among employees experiencing daily stress (49%), right behind the Middle East and North Africa (52%). By contrast, Europe showed the lowest level of employee engagement (13%). South Asia scored lowest in terms of employees described as thriving overall (13%). And countries in post-Soviet Eurasia ranked lowest in terms of daily stress (19%).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/success/gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

Joe Scarborough, speaking alongside co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Willie Geist, said that the show\u2019s staff had been told on Sunday evening that all of MSNBC\u2019s lineup would be pre-empted for a single NBC News feed in the wake of the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. But, as he noted, \u201cthat did not happen.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know why that was that didn\u2019t happen. Our team was not given a good answer as to why that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Scarborough said. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d \u201cWe were also told it was going to happen throughout the day, and I guess, after there was such a strong blowback about yesterday morning, I guess they changed their plans,\u201d Scarborough added. \u201cWe were very surprised, we were very disappointed.\u201d Spokespersons for NBCUniversal News Group and MSNBC did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment on Tuesday morning. CNN\u00a0first reported\u00a0Sunday evening that Cesar Conde, the NBCUniversal News Group chairman, had made the decision to pull the top-rated morning program Monday, in conjunction with Rashida Jones, the MSNBC president, and Scarborough and Brzezinski. In the wake of the attempt on Trump\u2019s life, some of the former president\u2019s supporters have vehemently criticized the press and liberal media commentators for their hard-knuckled reporting, which has sounded the alarm on what four more years under the former president would look like. MSNBC has, in particular, been blasted by Trump\u2019s allies, putting the network in the spotlight. Some of Trump\u2019s allies have gone as far as to attack the network\u2019s parent company, Comcast. The decision to pull \u201cMorning Joe\u201d was made with that political reality in mind. A person familiar with the matter told CNN on Sunday they moved to preempt the celebrated roundtable program over concerns a guest might make an inappropriate comment that could be used to assail the program and network as a whole. Given the breaking news nature of the story, the person said, it made more sense to continue airing rolling breaking news coverage in the fraught political moment. \u201cWe want to be here for our audience, and we know you trust us, and we have ultimate respect for you guys,\u201d Geist said. \u201cSo we are here today. I wish we\u2019d been here yesterday.\u201d Brzezinski added that \u201cMorning Joe\u201d is a special program because it is \u201cthe place where you can go to have the hard conversations in a civil way.\u201d \u201cAnd so it seemed like now more than ever, is a day, a time, that we would like to be on,\u201d Brzezinski said. \u201cAnd I think our viewers agree with that.\u201d Scarborough told viewers the show\u2019s staff would cover news events in the future and threatened to quit if the program is once again pulled from the air. \u201cLet me just say, next time we\u2019re told there\u2019s going to be a news feed replacing us, we will be in our chairs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe news feed will be us, or they can get somebody else to host the show.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/media/morning-joe-pulled-hosts-disappointed-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_media_hunter-biden-sues-fox-news", "text": "Hunter Biden has sued Fox News and its parent corporation, accusing the right-wing network of smearing him and unlawfully publishing his explicit images without his consent in a 2022 miniseries about his legal troubles. In the lawsuit, filed Sunday in New York state court, the president\u2019s sonaccuses Fox News of unjust enrichment, intentionally inflicting emotional distress, and violating New York civil rights laws. The lawsuit makes good on\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s threat he made in April that he would take the network to court if it didn\u2019t immediately issue retractions and corrections. The miniseries, \u201cThe Trial of Hunter Biden,\u201d was a six-part offering on the Fox Nation digital streaming network, and was also promoted on Fox News, the cable TV channel. It featured a dramatized \u201cmock trial\u201d about Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas financial dealings that led in part to his federal tax indictment and that also fueled House Republicans\u2019 struggling impeachment inquiry into his father. Fox News\u00a0took down the miniseries\u00a0in late April, one day after Hunter Biden threatened to file a lawsuit. But according to the lawsuit, promotional materials for the miniseries are still on some Fox News-linked social media pages, and the miniseries episodes are still circulating \u201conline and in the public domain.\u201d A Fox News spokesperson claimed the lawsuit was meritless and \u201centirely politically motivated,\u201d and said the network looks forward to \u201cvindicating our rights in court.\u201d \u201cThe core complaint stems from a 2022 streaming program that Mr. Biden did not complain about until sending a letter in late April 2024,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe program was removed within days of the letter, in an abundance of caution, but Hunter Biden is a public figure who has been the subject of multiple investigations and is now a convicted felon. Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden\u2019s own making.\u201d The new lawsuit claims Fox News \u201ctargeted Mr. (Hunter) Biden in an effort to harass, annoy, alarm, and humiliate him, and tarnish his reputation.\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s son is seeking an unspecified amount of punitive damages, as well as any profits that Fox reaped from the miniseries, and other corrective measures. \u201cThe miniseries is fictionalized; it is not a news event. It was made for the purpose of trade and advertising, and merely exploits Mr. Biden\u2019s name, image, and likeness for Fox\u2019s commercial benefit,\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers wrote in the lawsuit. Hunter Biden\u2019s team said in the lawsuit that without his consent, Fox News \u201cunlawfully published numerous intimate images (both still and video) of Mr. Biden depicting him in the nude, depicting an unclothed or exposed intimate part of him, as well as engaged in sex acts.\u201d The right-wing network said these images originated form Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0infamous laptop\u00a0\u2013 data from which was leaked by allies for former President Donald Trump in 2020. The president\u2019s son was\u00a0convicted at a trial\u00a0last month on federal gun charges, and faces a second trial this fall on alleged tax crimes.

{"id": "2024_07_16_investing_gold-bars-bob-menendez", "text": "On Tuesday, Sen. Bob Menendez was found guilty on 16 counts including bribery, extortion, wire fraud, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent. A key piece of evidence prosecutors presented to jurors during the nearly seven-week-long trial was the gold bars the FBI seized from the senator\u2019s home which he and his wife allegedly received in exchange for acting on behalf of foreign government officials and business people. Menendez maintains his innocence and plans to appeal the verdict, he told reporters outside the Manhattan courtroom on Tuesday. The discovery that Menendez owned a hoard of gold bars stunned many people. Who even owns physical bars of gold these days? Actually, a lot of people. Going for gold Demand for gold\u00a0was already on the rise as people have sought ways to hedge their investments against inflation. Since gold is a tangible asset with a limited supply, it offers that stability. Then, a string of bank failures, beginning with the\u00a0demise of Silicon Valley Bank\u00a0last year, added to the momentum. It was \u201ca wakeup call\u201d to many people, said Jonathan Rose, CEO of Genesis Gold Group, a precious metals firm in Beverly Hills, California. \u201cThere was a feeling of helplessness,\u201d which he said he could attest to since he had money deposited at Western Alliance, which\u00a0came under a significant amount of stress\u00a0in the wake of SVB\u2019s collapse. \u201cA lot of people were fearful thinking, \u2018Maybe my money is not as safe as I thought it was in the banking system.\u2019\u201d As a result, interest in owning gold jumped as people searched for tangible stores of value that \u201ccan\u2019t evaporate,\u201d Rose told CNN. And now even Costco sells gold bars. Ironically, gold hit a record high on Tuesday, the same day Menendez was convicted. That\u2019s because of US investors\u2019 renewed confidence in the prospect of interest rate cuts this year, which also helped the Dow and S&P 500 notch new record highs. The two kilograms and 11 ounces worth of gold bars Menendez and his wife possessed would have been worth over $185,000 as of Tuesday, according to Goldprice.org data. If you can invest in gold, why do people want to physically own it? Even though you can invest in gold and other precious metals without physically owning them, people tend to prefer \u201chaving the currency in their hands,\u201d said Rose. That\u2019s because if, for instance, you invest in a gold ETF, \u201cit\u2019s still tied to the market,\u201d he said. That means if the market were to plunge, you\u2019d be exposed to it and suffer some losses as a result. Where should people keep their gold? Plenty of his clients have buried the gold he\u2019s sold them in the ground, he said. One even stored it in an empty paint can in their garage. Other people who prefer to keep gold under their own roof store it in a gun safe or floor safe, he added. For added assurance, you can take out an insurance policy or keep it in a safe deposit box at a bank, but most of his clients opt not to, he said. However, people who want to invest in IRS-approved physical gold in their tax-deferred investment accounts by law are required to keep it in a bank or with a non-bank trustee.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/investing/gold-bars-bob-menendez/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_business_tractor-supply-dei-climate-lgbtq", "text": "As recently as February, Tractor Supply Co., known for selling animal feed, pet food and lawn and garden equipment to hobby farmers, told investors that climate change was a significant threat to its business. Any delay or failure to meet its goals of cutting emissions 50% in six years and achieving net zero emissions by 2040 could hurt \u201cpublic perception of our business, employee morale, customer or stockholder support\u201d and its financial performance, the company said in its annual report. Tractor Supply also warned that it could suffer similar business consequences if it did not meet its five-year diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) plan to increase spending by 35% with diverse suppliers and boost representation of people of color at manager levels and above at the company by 50%. Hal Lawton, the chief executive of the Brentwood, Tennessee-based company, had said these initiatives \u201cmake great business sense for Tractor Supply.\u201d But Tractor Supply has decided that all of those risks are now worth ignoring. The company announced last month that it will withdraw its carbon emission reduction goals and eliminate jobs and goals focused on diversity, equity and inclusion. It will also stop sponsoring LGBTQ+ Pride festivals and voting campaigns, as well as submitting data to the Human Rights Campaign, one of the biggest LGBTQ+ non-profit advocacy groups in the United States. By walking away from diversity and climate goals, Tractor Supply has become the latest corporate giant to retreat from progressive initiatives it once promoted, joining Bud Light, Target and others. Although the company\u2019s changes have placated some customers, they have hurt its reputation with other customers and employees and could bring on the type of risks the brand recently warned about. Tractor Supply is \u201ctrying to thread the needle,\u201d said Nooshin Warren, a professor of marketing at the University of Arizona who studies corporate activism and corporate political culture. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to keep both sides happy, which usually never happens.\u201d Tractor Supply, she noted, has become a more diverse company in recent years, and the company\u2019s decision could alienate employees. Racial and ethnic minorities make up 18% of its approximately 50,000 employees and 33% of its board of directors, and it has earned strong ratings from the Human Rights Campaign for LGBTQ+ inclusive policies. Tractor Supply\u2019s reversal came after Robby Starbuck, who in 2022 launched a failed bid for Tennessee\u2019s 5th Congressional District and now hosts a podcast, waged a weeks-long campaign on X calling on customers to boycott Tractor Supply and contact its corporate leadership over the company\u2019s LGBTQ+ and DEI hiring initiatives. \u201cIt\u2019s time to expose Tractor Supply,\u201d he first posted June 6, drawing attention to corporate components like \u201cLGBTQIA+ events at work\u201d and \u201ca DEI council.\u201d Other conservative political candidates, activists and customers began criticizing the company on social media, and said they would stop shopping at the chain. \u201cWe have heard from customers that we have disappointed them,\u201d Tractor Supply said. \u201cWe have taken this feedback to heart.\u201d \u201cGoing forward,\u201d Tractor Supply said, \u201cwe will ensure our activities and giving tie directly to our business.\u201d The company said that although it\u2019s ending DEI goals and carbon emissions goals, it will still ensure a \u201crespectful environment\u201d and focus on land and water conservation efforts. But Tractor Supply\u2019s reversal has already caused outcry. The National Black Farmers Association, a non-profit advocacy group representing 130,000 Black farmers and their families, has called for Lawton\u2019s resignation and said the company has \u201clittle respect for (Black) farmers.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re sending the wrong signal to America at the wrong time in history,\u201d John Boyd, the president of the organization, told CNN. \u201cAmerica isn\u2019t just white men. It\u2019s made up a lot of different people. They have a lot of people they\u2019re offending.\u201d Boyd, a fourth-generation farmer who is a Tractor Supply shareholder and customer and buys feed, mineral blocks and fencing frequently from the chain, said many Black farmers rely on Tractor Supply for their suppliers. He feels the company \u201ccaved to hard right-wing nonsense\u201d and plans to stop shopping at the chain. A Tractor Supply store manager in upstate New York who is gay resigned and told the town newspaper that the company \u201cbetrayed\u201d employees and customers. Tractor Supply declined to comment on these statements. Tractor Supply\u2019s customer base Tractor Supply has a broad customer base. The company has more than 2,400 stores in 49 states and targets recreational farmers, ranchers, animal and pet owners who primarily live in towns outside major metropolitan areas and in rural communities. Rural areas tend to be more politically conservative than urban areas. In 2020, Republican candidate Donald Trump won 65% of rural voters, according to Pew. But suburban areas are more politically divided \u2014 in 2020, Democratic candidate Joe Biden won 54% of suburban voters. Tractor Supply\u2019s customer base has historically been primarily older men, who lean Republican, but Tractor Supply has increasingly tried to draw Millennials and women, who tend to favor Democrats. Since the pandemic, the company has gained ground with younger consumers who moved out of cities. \u201cCustomer demographic trends continue to trend younger and more female than pre-pandemic,\u201d Lawton said last year. Tractor Supply\u2019s reversal could hurt it with these customers, who could be crucial as the company\u2019s historic base ages out of the market. \u201cTractor Supply Co. is turning its back on their own neighbors with this shortsighted decision,\u201d Eric Bloem, vice president of Programs and Corporate Advocacy at the Human Rights Campaign, told CNN in a statement Saturday. \u201cLGBTQ+ people live in every zip code in this country, including rural communities. We are shoppers, farmers, veterans and agriculture students.\u201d Squirrelwood Equine Sanctuary, a New York animal sanctuary that says it spends more than $65,000 annually at Tractor Supply, said it plans to stop shopping at the chain. \u201cWe never asked for a pride flag out front. We do expect respect and inclusion. You have lost our business and every shred of respect we might have had,\u201d the non-profit said on X. Corporate America\u2019s retreat Particularly after the May 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, companies rolled out policies aimed at diversifying their workforces and welcoming customers from all backgrounds. But Tractor Supply\u2019s reversal is part of a larger corporate retreat on DEI programs and environmental goals. Many of these efforts are now under attack from right-wing activists, businessmen such as Bill Ackman and Elon Musk, and others. The backlash also comes amid a wave of legislation in Republican-led states to curtail LGBTQ rights and cut DEI programs in colleges and universities, alongside lawsuits to stop 401(k) managers from considering climate change and other environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors when selecting investments. Right-wing groups have threatened boycotts against brands like Bud Light, Disney and Nike to roll back their inclusivity efforts. They\u2019ve even gone after Chick-fil-A for its diversity programs and Cracker Barrel for selling plant-based sausages, brands traditionally seen as conservative. Last year, Bud Light\u2019s partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked an anti-trans backlash and a months-long boycott of the beer brand, throughout which the company failed to take a firm stance in support of Mulvaney and the transgender community. The boycott and the subsequent tepid response lost parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev as much as $1.4 billion in sales, as well as its credibility with a major LGBTQ+ non-profit. Last month, retailer Target said it will limit how many stores would carry its Pride-themed collection for adults after a boycott from right-wing activists last summer led to a sharp dip in sales.

Italian company EssilorLuxottica announced Wednesday that it\u2019s buying Supreme for $1.5 billion in cash from VF Corp. (VFC), the parent company of Vans and Dickies, which bought the brand for $2.1 billion in 2020. Supreme \u201cperfectly aligns with our innovation and development journey, offering us a direct connection to new audiences, languages and creativity,\u201d EssilorLuxottica said in a statement. The company added that the brand will have its \u201cown space\u201d in its portfolio and marks its first-ever apparel brand acquisition. The name EssilorLuxottica isn\u2019t well known to shoppers, but the glasses the company makes are. Its collection includes Oliver Peoples, Ray-Ban, Oakley, and Persol. It also has licensing agreements with Chanel, Coach and Dolce & Gabbana. Founded in a New York skateboard shop in 1994,\u00a0Supreme has won over skateboarders and hip-hop fans with its apparel, also popular among other Millennial and Generation Z shoppers. The Carlyle Group acquired half the company in 2007 for\u00a0$500 million. Shares of VF Corp. soared nearly 7% in premarket trading. The company explained that there were \u201climited synergies\u201d between Supreme and its own brands, making a sale a \u201cnatural next step.\u201d The sale makes sense, according to Neil Saunders, retail analyst at GlobalData, who told CNN that the company previously \u201coverpaid for a trophy asset which it was not sure how to develop or nurture,\u201d resulting in a loss. \u201cBuying a streetwear brand at a time when that aesthetic has gone off the boil is risky, and it is not clear what EssilorLuxottica intends to do to revive Supreme\u2019s fortunes,\u201d Saunders said.

Late last year, Meta (META)\u00a0launched\u00a0a service called \u201cSubscription for no ads,\u201d allowing European users of Facebook and Instagram to pay up to \u20ac12.99 ($14) a month for ad-free versions. The alternative is to accept versions with personalized ads. The European Commission said in a statement Monday that, in its preliminary view, \u201cthis binary choice forces users to consent to the (use) of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalized but equivalent version of Meta\u2019s social networks.\u201d If the provisional findings of the Commission\u2019s investigation are confirmed, the EU could hit Meta with a fine equivalent to 10% of its global annual revenue under its landmark Digital Markets Act. Based on the company\u2019s 2023 results, that would amount to $13.5 billion. Meta said it didn\u2019t accept the Commission\u2019s findings. \u201c\u2019Subscription for no ads\u2019 follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.\u201d The EU announcement comes a week after the Commission accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the DMA by preventing app developers from freely directing consumers to cheaper services. The regulators are also investigating Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) under the new law. The DMA, which came into force in March, requires dominant online platforms \u2014 so-called gatekeepers \u2014 to give users more choice, and rivals more opportunities to compete. Online platforms often collect personal data across their own and third-party services and use it in digital advertising services. Margrethe Vestager, a European Commissioner in charge of competition policy, noted in Monday\u2019s statement that Meta had been accumulating personal data of \u201cmillions of EU citizens over many years.\u201d \u201cWe want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalized ads experience,\u201d she said. Michael Koenig, a senior official at the Commission, said Meta must offer users an alternative to \u201cfull\u201d ad personalization that \u201cdoes not rely on this personal data and which is then automatically less personalized and still available to them.\u201d \u201cThen Meta is free to keep a third option, which is a subscription not to see ads at all, or a fourth option which may have some premium features,\u201d he told journalists. The Commission is due to conclude its probe into Meta by late March next year.

{"id": "2024_06_17_success_how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges", "text": "Long before you take your high schooler on college campus tours, consider this: Shopping for college shouldn\u2019t be any different than shopping for a home.\u00a0When you want to buy a home, you come up with a range of how much you can afford and get pre-qualified for a mortgage. Then you look in neighborhoods that offer homes that meet your family\u2019s needs and fall within your price range. \u201cAdopt a mindset that we\u2019re buying college like we\u2019re buying a house,\u201d said Beth Walker, author of \u201cBuying College Better\u201d and \u201cNever Pay Retail for College.\u201d As a financial adviser and certified\u00a0college planning specialist, Walker tries to help families avoid a situation that many find themselves in at the 11th hour: Their child applies \u2014 and gets into \u2014 schools they cannot afford because the schools won\u2019t give them enough aid. And then they just \u2026 try to make it work, no matter how much debt is involved for the parents or the student. Instead, she advises families to start as early as 9th or 10th grade in figuring out what is affordable for them as a family \u2014 so parents don\u2019t sacrifice their own financial welfare and the future college student doesn\u2019t drown in debt upon graduation. And second, she recommends assessing how a child\u2019s talents and interests pare with majors and careers they might want to pursue. Doing both those things can help you target the right colleges to apply to. Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners, defines the perfect college as one \u201cwhere a student can go be happy, safe and successful, graduate in four years or less with a marketable degree and little or no debt.\u201d In helping families align parents\u2019 affordability constraints with their student\u2019s academic and social needs, he cautions them not to automatically assume the Ivys or other high-prestige schools will be best simply because of their status. And he stresses what success in life looks like after college and notes that an Ivy League degree isn\u2019t the only path to achieving it, especially if your child won\u2019t get much aid to attend. In fact, said Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, a lot of brand-name schools don\u2019t even offer merit-based aid, only need-based. So if you\u2019re not rich, but you make too much to qualify for need-based aid, you could find yourself having to cover the entire cost of tuition, room and board every year, which is pushing $90,000 at some US colleges. Set up financial guardrails well before the college search Fothergill created a free calculator called CostHero that lets parents assess what financial resources they will have available to pay for a child\u2019s college education. It then provides a range of affordability: At the low end is the number representing what they can pay if they don\u2019t take on debt. And at the high end is the number they can pay if they also take out an unsubsidized federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). \u201cIf you\u2019re not in a position to write a check for $90,000 a year, put up guardrails for yourself so you don\u2019t blow up your retirement,\u201d he said. The calculator inputs let you set the amount of resources you\u2019re willing to use to pay for college from your income and savings, your child\u2019s earnings from summer jobs, any family gifts, and any federal Stafford loans your child may take. It also factors in if you qualify for the federal American Opportunity Tax Credit. That credit, for qualified educational expenses, will reduce your tax bill or increase any refund you have coming. The calculator also gives you a debt-to-income score like the kind a mortgage lender might use to assess whether you\u2019re a good credit risk. Ideally, he said, you don\u2019t want your housing costs to exceed 36% of your gross income and your total debt \u2014 including debt from housing, cars, credit cards and any parental education loans \u2014 to exceed 43%. If your DTI ratio is close to or higher than 43% that is a sign you could get yourself into trouble if you end up having any financial problems while your child is in college, Fothergill said. \u201cIf folks have a way to determine the range of affordability prior to the onset of the college search, the outcomes are a lot better.\u00a0 For example, if one knows that the range of affordability is between $30,000 [a year] with no parent debt and $50,000 with parent debt, then any college that comes in with a net cost in that range is, by definition, affordable,\u201d Fothergill said. Net cost refers to the true cost of attendance after figuring out how much aid your child may get (e.g., grants and scholarships). Figure out where your student may qualify for the most aid Generally speaking, the biggest tuition discounts go to the most academically accomplished students in an incoming class. \u201cThe student needs to be in the top 25% of those admitted,\u201d Walker said. Getting into that top 25% cohort is based on SAT or ACT scores, and having a high, unweighted GPA based on a rigorous high school curriculum. The curriculum\u2019s academic rigor can be further bolstered by taking AP courses. Since your child is more likely to make the top quartile at some schools than others, Fothergill and Walker both recommend your child focus on applying only to those schools in which they stand the best chances of being in that top group to maximize their chances for merit-based aid. Otherwise, you\u2018ll spend money to apply to guidance-counselor-recommended \u201csafety\u201d schools or \u201creach\u201d schools with no sense if those places are affordable to you should your child get in. Using reported data from admissions officers about their key criteria in admitting an incoming class and based on what more than 1,000 schools report about the qualifications they used to grant aid, Fothergill created another tool called ListHero. It gives students a score that helps gauge\u00a0how competitive their profile is\u00a0at a given school, relative to others admitted, and by extension their eligibility for tuition discounts. Right now the tool is only available to college planning professionals for a fee. But Fothergill plans to create a free mini-version for consumers to use. For parents doing their own research on test scores, GPA requirements, costs and aid, he recommends checking the Department of Education College Scorecard, the site CollegeData.com and the College Board. Other ways to reduce college costs before applying While your children are in high school they can take other steps to reduce the total cost of their education. One way is by doing well on the PSAT to qualify to compete for a National Merit Scholarship. Another is to take AP courses. If their high school doesn\u2019t offer them, there is a program called Freshman Year for Free offered by the Modern States Education Alliance. It provides free AP placement courses and pays the fee for students to take the AP tests or college-level preparation (CLEP) tests administered through the College Board. Getting the minimum AP scores a college requires to earn a college credit will lower how much you ultimately have to spend on tuition. A third option is to see if your state has a program that offers a year of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to a state university from which your child could earn their degree. Or, if you plan to go to any other college, make sure the school will accept the credits from a community college course you plan to take. No matter what steps you take, starting the research and budgeting process early can save everyone a lot of stress, debt and potential heartache in the end. Said Walker: \u201cWe have to be a lot more intentional about this purchase.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/success/how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_media_morning-joe-backlash-nbc-comcast-executives", "text": "Cesar Conde has found himself \u2014 yet again \u2014 on the receiving end of a stinging on-air rebuke from his high-wattage MSNBC stars. For the second time in only a few months, questions about the NBC News Group chairman\u2019s leadership were raised in extraordinary fashion, with the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d team on Tuesday publicly expressing dismay that NBC brass had the day before pulled their broadcast from the air in wake of the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. Joe Scarborough, speaking alongside co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Willie Geist, offered viewers a peek behind the curtain into the conspicuous decision-making process that transpired over the weekend. Scarborough said that the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d team had been informed Sunday evening that all of MSNBC\u2019s opinion-oriented dayside lineup would be pre-empted for a single NBC News feed covering the attempt on Trump\u2019s life. But, as Scarborough noted, \u201cThat did not happen.\u201d Instead of high-profile NBC News anchors, such as Lester Holt and Savannah Guthrie, anchoring special coverage, MSNBC aired two hours of \u201cMSNBC Reports\u201d and two hours of its streaming service\u2019s programming, NBC News Now. And oddly enough, no other MSNBC shows were pre-empted. Only \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know why that was that didn\u2019t happen. Our team was not given a good answer as to why that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Scarborough said. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Scarborough, who said the entire \u201cMorning Joe\u201d team was \u201cvery surprised\u201d and \u201cvery disappointed\u201d in the turn of events spurred by NBC brass, even went as far to offer network leadership an ultimatum. \u201cNext time we are told there is going to be a news feed replacing us, we will be in our chairs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the news feed will be us, or they can get somebody else to host the show.\u201d While the top-rated, largely unscripted show has long been a must-watch for politicos in the Acela Corridor, the program has taken on additional significance in recent weeks, airing major news-making live interviews with President Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and others as the president battles to continue his campaign. Without \u201cMorning Joe\u201d airing on Monday, viewers rebelled against MSNBC, opting to change the channel, Nielsen data indicated. During the four-hour block, the total audience was down 40%, and the demo plunged nearly 50%, compared to this year\u2019s average. Spokespeople for NBC News Group and MSNBC did not directly respond to Scarborough\u2019s Tuesday remarks. But the flare up represented another embarrassing moment for Conde in which behind-the-scenes tension between MSNBC and NBC News Group found its way into the public view. It also raised questions about the progressive news network\u2019s editorial decisions and independence, particularly as Trump and his allies target its parent company, Comcast.  The move to bench the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d crew, after all, didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. Over the course of the last year, Trump has assailed Brian Roberts, the Comcast chairman, applying pressure on him over his distaste for coverage from MSNBC. In November, Trump called Roberts a \u201cslime ball\u201d and declared the government \u201cshould come down hard on them\u201d and \u201cmake them pay\u201d for their supposedly \u201cillegal political activity.\u201d\u00a0  \u201cMuch more to come, watch!\u201d Trump wrote at the time, a not-so-veiled threat.  Those attacks on Comcast were revived in the immediate aftermath of the Trump assassination attempt. Trump\u2019s allies leveled attacks against MSNBC, accusing the network in bad faith of radicalizing Trump\u2019s critics and, thus, creating an environment that led to the shooting. (It should be noted that, at this time, authorities have not determined the shooter\u2019s motive.) At the RNC this week, attacks on MSNBC have been in vogue, with GOP figures such as Donald Trump Jr. and Sarah Huckabee Sanders singling out the outlet and bashing it.\u00a0   Suffice to say, Roberts and the Comcast team, which will potentially have M&A business before the next presidential administration, probably do not wish to find themselves on Trump\u2019s enemies list. A spokesperson for Comcast did not comment Tuesday when asked whether Roberts has weighed in on any of NBC News Group\u2019s recent programming decisions. Regardless, it\u2019s not difficult to imagine that he been irked by the situation at MSNBC, a small slice of the business at Comcast, that continues to cause headaches. Which is why, perhaps, Comcast is involved in cleaning up the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d mess. I\u2019m told that the company\u2019s president, Mike Cavanagh, rescheduled meetings on Tuesday to grapple with the fallout stemming from the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d commentary. While this particular episode will almost certainly blow over soon enough, the underlying issues are likely to remain. Without strong leadership atop NBCU News Group \u2014 leadership that is truly respected by staff \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine that such eruptions from talent will miraculously come to a halt. If anything, the staff at 30 Rock might feel more empowered to speak out against network brass after the events of the last few months. And that can\u2019t bode well for Conde, who must be standing on thinning ice as it becomes more evident he is struggling to manage the increasingly vocal personalities who, at least on paper, report to him.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/media/morning-joe-backlash-nbc-comcast-executives/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_business_office-building-conversion-to-apartments", "text": "Most Americans know the No. 1 rule in real estate: \u201clocation, location, location.\u201d But for some developers, there\u2019s a new winning strategy: \u201crecycle, recycle, recycle.\u201d A growing number of office buildings have found second lives as apartments, boosted by the Covid-era work-from-home movement that slashed office attendance and thinned out cities\u2019 downtowns. But breaking up sterile, expansive workspaces into inviting homes is harder than you might think. Real estate developers say these projects can be like working out a puzzle: Office buildings are designed with very different considerations than apartment dwellings. Some conversions aren\u2019t possible, and unexpected costs can add up. Even so, as office vacancies hit a record 20.1% in the United States in the second quarter of this year, according to a recent report from Moody\u2019s Analytics, and the supply of homes remains persistently below demand, local governments have upped incentives for office building conversions. These include tax breaks and speedier approval processes for real estate developers willing to remake the spaces. Nearly 70 million square feet of office space, or 1.7% of the total US supply, was in the process of being converted for other uses in the first three months of 2024, according to a recent report from commercial real estate firm CBRE. Sixty-three percent of those conversions are expected to be into multi-family housing. How does it work? At first glance, The Crosby, an apartment building that opened in 2020 in Los Angeles\u2019 Koreatown neighborhood, seems like a typical luxury high-rise. It boasts plush amenities like a fitness center and pool deck. Residents of The Crosby\u2019s 336 apartment units may not know, though, that their building was the former West Coast headquarters of oil and gas company Texaco. Converting an office space like Texaco\u2019s into luxury units requires \u201cbasically gutting everything,\u201d said Jaime Lee, CEO of Jamison Group, the building\u2019s owner, which oversaw the renovation. \u201cWe are basically clearing the floors,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just have the floors, the building shell and the elevators left.\u201d Unlike a traditional office layout, each apartment unit needs to have at least one bathroom and a kitchen, meaning plumbing must be reworked. And most office buildings have central air conditioning, so the system needs to be replaced with individual cooling and heating systems for each unit. Sometimes, the project is more costly than initially expected. \u201cEspecially for buildings that have been around for a long time and have seen lots of different tenants over the years \u2014there have been times when we\u2019ve opened up a wall and realized there is more work to be done,\u201d Lee said. Although converting unused office buildings into housing units may seem like an easy remedy for the affordable housing crisis, some office buildings (even those that are entirely empty or have multiple floors sitting empty) cannot feasibly be converted into housing, said Chris Sherman, the president of Sherman Associates, a real estate developer based in Minneapolis. \u201cOnly about 15% of office buildings here in the markets that we\u2019re based in are potentially good candidates for office-to-housing conversions,\u201d Sherman said. Older buildings are best, he said. Apartments require operable windows, which most newer buildings lack. New buildings also tend to have a larger square footage. While that may initially seem like a positive, apartment units need to have access to windows facing the exterior. To have access to natural light, the units can\u2019t stretch too far from the windows, Sherman said. \u201cYou end up with a scenario where you\u2019re not able to utilize a lot of the middle of that floor plate,\u201d Sherman said. Local governments play a role Older buildings also qualify for historic tax credits, making these conversions more financially feasible, said Sherman. The key to these conversions is local government buy-in, said Jason Ward, the co-director of the RAND Center on Housing and Homelessness. Recent tax breaks and major cities loosening zoning restrictions like the required width of apartment stairways and parking requirements have made more of these transformations possible, Ward said. In September, New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced an effort to eliminate mandates that parking spaces be included with new construction, freeing up space to build more homes. One of the largest ever office-to-residential conversions will begin construction soon: The former headquarters of Pfizer in New York\u2019s Midtown will be converted into roughly 1,500 new rental apartments. Los Angeles also recently established a faster approval process for the conversion of existing buildings that are at least 15 years old. \u201cEncouraging the reuse of buildings is a sustainable practice to extend the life of buildings and retain much of the resources that went into their initial construction,\u201d a March ordinance from the city said. Local governments aren\u2019t only pushing for office building conversions, though. John Watson, CEO of Indianapolis-based Core Redevelopment, said he has transformed abandoned schools and hotels into housing, as well. \u201cLarge office buildings are probably the most difficult to do,\u201d Watson said. \u201cHotels and schools are easy.\u201d The project Watson is most proud of, though, is the Stadium Lofts, an apartment building built from the remnants of an old baseball stadium in Indianapolis. He bought the stadium from the city for $1 and revitalized it for $28 million, including $5 million from the city. \u201cI went to the city and said, \u2018Look, this is physically possible, but I have a $5 million gap between what it\u2019s worth and what it costs,\u2019 and the city said they\u2019d fund the gap because it would help expand downtown and add to the vibrancy of the neighborhood,\u201d Watson told CNN. \u201cIt turned out to be one of the best projects I ever did.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/business/office-building-conversion-to-apartments/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

The use of an AI voice for the Olympics comes as the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, sound and text.

In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_business_china-firms-illegal-pregnancy-tests-intl-hnk", "text": "More than a dozen Chinese companies face legal action for allegedly asking job applicants to take pregnancy tests, state media has reported. Prosecutors found that 168 women seeking positions at 16 companies in Nantong, a city in the eastern province of Jiangsu, had been tested illegally as part of their pre-employment physical check, the state-run Procuratorial Daily reported on Monday. The case highlights a contradiction at the heart of the Chinese economy: While the country is trying to boost record-low birth rates, some companies are reluctant to hire pregnant workers. Employers have reportedly avoided recruiting women of childbearing age \u2014 with reports of women being asked about family planning during job interviews, or being passed over for roles even if they don\u2019t plan to have children. Chinese law bans employers from administering pregnancy tests or discriminating against pregnant workers. In Nantong, authorities were tipped off by an online public litigation group, which said some employers in the city had given pregnancy tests to job seekers. Working with the group, prosecutors launched an investigation and visited two major public hospitals and a medical exam center, according to the report. At least one woman who was found to be expecting\u00a0was not hired, the prosecutors said. The report didn\u2019t name any of the companies nor specify whether any of them had been fined. According to Chinese law,\u00a0companies can be fined up to 50,000 yuan ($6,900) for gender\u00a0discrimination. Demographic crisis China\u2019s population has shrunk for two years in a row and its birth rate in 2023 was the lowest since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic\u00a0in 1949. In 2022, China was\u00a0surpassed by India\u00a0as the world\u2019s most populous country. The demographic crisis is a threat to the\u00a0world\u2019s second-largest economy\u00a0\u2014 and has deepened in recent years despite authorities\u2019 efforts to reverse the trend following decades of restrictive birth policies. Alarmed by the falling birth rate in recent years, the government scrapped\u00a0the \u201cone child\u201d policy that was in place for 35 years.\u00a0In 2015, it allowed couples to have two children, and in 2021 raised this to three. But the policy change has had minimal effect on the population drop. China is one of the most expensive places in the world to raise a child in relative terms, with the\u00a0disproportionate impact on women\u00a0driving the country\u2019s precipitously low fertility rate, according to a recent report from the\u00a0YuWa Population Research Institute. The average nationwide cost of raising a child from birth to age 17 was about $74,800 and rises to more than $94,500 to support a child through a bachelor\u2019s degree, the report said. The cost of raising a child to age 18 in China is 6.3 times higher than the country\u2019s GDP per capita. Women taking maternity leave may face \u201cunfair treatment\u201d at work such as being transferred to other teams, taking a pay cut, or missing out on promotion opportunities, the report said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/business/china-firms-illegal-pregnancy-tests-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_tech_amazon-warehouses-prime-day-injuries-senate", "text": "Amazon\u2019s warehouses are especially dangerous for workers during the company\u2019s annual Prime Day event, as well as the holiday season, according to an investigation by the US Senate. Prime Day, held on Tuesday and Wednesday this week, is \u201ca major cause of injuries for the warehouse workers who make it possible,\u201d said a report released Monday by Sen. Bernie Sanders, who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. The report noted \u201cthe extremely unsafe conditions in Amazon warehouses\u201d during the two peak periods and called on the company to do more to protect warehouse workers. During its ongoing investigation, the committee found that Prime Day and the holiday season at Amazon (AMZN) are characterized by an \u201cextremely high volume\u201d of work and \u201cintense pressure to work long hours and ignore safety guidelines.\u201d The report makes public, for the first time, the company\u2019s internal data on warehouse injury rates. The data shows that during Prime Day 2019 the rate of \u201crecordable\u201d injuries \u2014 those Amazon is required to disclose to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \u2014 exceeded 10 per 100 workers, more than double the average in the US warehousing and storage industry. But Amazon\u2019s total injury rate, which includes injuries the company does not have to report to OSHA, was just under 45 per 100 workers, the report said. \u201cThese injury rates are especially egregious in light of the incredible revenue the company generates and the resources it has available to make its warehouses safe for workers,\u201d it added. Amazon raked in $12.7 billion in sales on July 11 and 12 last year, its Prime Day 2023 event, and said July 11 was the single biggest sales day in the company\u2019s history. For the first three months of 2024, the e-commerce giant reported a profit of $10.4 billion. \u201cThe safety and health of our employees is and always will be our top priority,\u201d Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson, told CNN in a statement. \u201cAnd since 2019, we\u2019ve made significant progress \u2014 reducing our recordable incident rate (which includes anything that requires more than basic first aid) in the US by 28%.\u201d The spokesperson also took issue with the total injury rate cited in the Senate report, saying it had come from a five-year-old internal document that had \u201cflawed methodology and gaps in the research\u201d and which was \u201crejected by experts who specialize in data analysis.\u201d The spokesperson added: \u201cOne of the false claims in the report implies that we\u2019re not adequately staffed for busy shopping periods. This is just not true, as we carefully plan and staff up for major events, ensure that we have excess capacity across our network, and design our network so that orders are automatically routed to sites that can handle unexpected spikes in volume.\u201d Over the years, some Amazon workers have described the \u201cgrueling\u201d experience of long hours racing around warehouses that can be the\u00a0size of 28 football fields\u00a0while the company tracks their every move. In a letter to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy last year, Sanders wrote: \u201cAmazon must stop pushing workers past their limits\u2026 In its endless pursuit of profits, Amazon sacrifices workers\u2019 bodies under the constant pressure of a surveillance system that enforces impossible rates (of work). When faced with worker injuries, Amazon provides minimal medical care.\u201d Amazon holds Prime Day in July every year to\u00a0juice sales numbers\u00a0during what are typically slow summer months.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/tech/amazon-warehouses-prime-day-injuries-senate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_media_secret-service-agents-women-trump-shooting", "text": "In the days following the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, the Secret Service, charged with securing the Pennsylvania event, has faced scrutiny for the extraordinary breach that led to the agency\u2019s worst failure in decades. But one narrative has quickly taken hold in parts of the right-wing media ecosystem:\u00a0The security failure was the result of workforce diversity initiatives and\u00a0women working as\u00a0Secret Service agents. While the security lapse happened outside of the event\u2019s hard perimeter at a poorly secured building roughly 120 to 150 meters away from the stage, prominent right-wing figures have launched misogynistic attacks, blaming the female agents positioned near Trump as well as Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, the\u00a0second woman to hold the top job\u00a0and\u00a0an advocate for women to join the force. In the seconds after shots rang out Saturday, male and\u00a0female agents\u00a0positioned\u00a0on stage with Trump sprang into action to protect the former president with their own bodies.\u00a0But in a series of social media posts and television appearances,\u00a0right-wing\u00a0media pundits\u00a0have\u00a0targeted the\u00a0female agents\u2019 response, claiming they\u00a0lacked the experience, size, and capability to\u00a0handle the situation.\u00a0Edited videos\u00a0that garnered millions of views\u00a0on social media\u00a0as supposed evidence of female incompetence,\u00a0showed a female Secret Service agent seemingly struggling to holster her gun amid\u00a0the\u00a0chaotic scene as a group of\u00a0agents\u00a0escorted Trump to his motorcade. Groups that represent women in law enforcement are also raising the alarm, saying such attacks are dangerous and disingenuous. Matt Walsh, a far-right media personality, wrote a series of posts on the social media platform X\u00a0assailing the notion of\u00a0women working as Secret Service agents. \u201cThere should not be any women in the Secret Service. These are supposed to be the very best, and none of the very best at this job are women,\u201d he wrote. Walsh, who has advocated for traditional gender roles,\u00a0claimed\u00a0without evidence\u00a0that\u00a0if any woman is hired\u00a0in the Secret Service, \u201cit 100 percent means that a more qualified male was passed over.\u201d But those experienced in federal law enforcement note that the female agents on Trump\u2019s detail acted swiftly along with their male counterparts. \u201cOne female agent joined the phalanx in shielding Trump from any possible additional incoming rounds, while another female agent with her gun drawn provided rear security,\u201d said Josh Campbell, former FBI supervisory special agent and CNN security correspondent. \u201cFemale agents were also among those guarding Trump\u2019s armored SUV as it prepared to depart the scene,\u201d said Campbell. Law enforcement experts say there is usually no hurry to holster a weapon, as doing so inherently means a firearm is not required to address a potential threat. The holstering process is also a moment where plain-clothes agents in particular must take care to ensure their trigger does not snag on a piece of loose clothing. Barbara Riggs, former deputy director of the Secret Service, called the criticism directed at female agents \u201cpreposterous, \u201ccrazy,\u201d and \u201cjust outrageous.\u201d The agents on stage acted according to their training, Riggs told CNN, communicating with each other about where they were escorting Trump despite a chaotic scene. They \u201cshould be commended, not vilified,\u201d she said. Right-wing media figures have bashed diversity initiatives for years, making \u201cDEI\u201d or \u201cDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\u201d a slur in the right-wing media ecosystem,\u00a0falsely\u00a0claiming that standards have been lowered to accommodate diverse hiring\u00a0practices. Everything from the Baltimore bridge collapse to safety issues in airliners has been placed at the feet of increasing diversity among the workforce. Women have been part of the Secret Service since 1971. All agents, male or female, must\u00a0meet the same standards to join the force, although women candidates have different physical fitness requirements. By nature, security details are privy to the most personal and intimate details of a protectee\u2019s life \u2013 including\u00a0any\u00a0women being guarded \u2013 and the presence of\u00a0women\u00a0on Secret Service details has been a staple for decades. In the immediate moments following the shooting, audio captured by Trump\u2019s microphone showed\u00a0agents\u00a0taking cover with Trump behind a lectern remained in place at\u00a0the scene until it was clear the shooter was down. But some on the right criticized the female agents as physically incapable of covering Trump\u2019s body\u00a0as he reached in the air to pump his fist in a sign of defiance to his supporters. \u201cHaving a small person as body cover for a large man is like an undersized Speedo at the beach \u2013 doesn\u2019t cover the subject,\u201d X owner Elon Musk, who later endorsed Trump and dedicated millions to his\u00a0reelection\u00a0effort,\u00a0wrote on the platform. \u201cCould be a man or a woman, to be clear, just needs to be large enough to do the job.\u201d But\u00a0even Musk, who travels with personal security,\u00a0has often been spotted with male guards noticeably shorter than him.\u00a0 On Fox News, host Laura Ingraham said that while she supports women,\u00a0\u201cwhen it comes to shielding the body of someone who is six-foot-three \u2026 you can\u2019t do it if you\u2019re five-foot-five. You can\u2019t do it.\u201d Riggs, who retired from the Secret Service in 2006, said the idea agents need to be bigger than the protectee is \u201cabsurd,\u201d noting that throughout the Secret Service\u2019s history there have been male agents of varying heights, which was never an issue. But the security failures at Trump\u2019s rally stem from a building outside of the perimeter that was being secured by local law enforcement, where the shooter managed to reach the roof and have a clear line of sight to Trump. The threat to Trump was not feet in front of him, where the female agents who were most scrutinized were located. And most of the agents with Trump that day were men. One notable voice on the right defended the female agents who protected Trump at the rally. Eric Trump, the former president\u2019s son, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Tuesday that, \u201cThe people on that stage love him. They would take a bullet for him.\u201d \u201cOne of the females on the stage, she was with me for three years.\u00a0I know everything about her. She would take a bullet for me. She would take a bullet for him. As courageous as they come,\u201d he added. \u201cThe same as everybody else that was around him, the head of his detail was on that stage. Believe me, the last thing they wanted was that to happen and they did all the right things.\u201d Still, other right-wing figures blamed\u00a0DEI\u00a0initiatives for incompetence at the federal agency led by Cheatle, only the second woman to head the Secret Service. Cheatle, who has served in the Secret Service for more than 25 years and was part of then-Vice President\u00a0Joe\u00a0Biden\u2019s security detail,\u00a0previously\u00a0led global security for PepsiCo. In a\u00a0CBS News interview\u00a0last year, she said that\u00a0the agency\u00a0had sought to boost the number of women in the force. \u201cI\u2019m very conscious as I sit in this chair now, of making sure that we need to attract diverse candidates and ensure that we are developing and giving opportunities to everybody in our workforce, and particularly women,\u201d Cheatle said. Right wing\u00a0figures also attacked Cheatle\u2019s previous work as head of security at PepsiCo, one of the largest food and beverage companies in the world. Tennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett, who has attacked Vice President Kamala Harris as a \u201cDEI\u201d hire in a \u201cbox checking White House,\u201d\u00a0wrote on X, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that a DEI hire from @pepsi would be a bad choice as the head of the Secret Service. #sarcasm.\u201d On the far-right cable channel One America News, host Dan Ball claimed Cheatle \u201chas been too worried about making sure all of the agents use the proper pronouns\u201d over ensuring the safety of the former president. Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, who sits on the Senate Homeland Security Committee,\u00a0told the Washington Post on Wednesday that he believes Cheatle \u201cwas far more concerned about DEI than protecting, for example, President Trump.\u201d Riggs said Cheatle did \u201cnot get that job as a token. It\u2019s because they bring the experience, and they\u2019ve been successful.\u201d She also defended recruitment efforts, noting that more diversity brings \u201cdifferent perspectives to the table and different experiences\u201d that can help view a situation in a different way, with unique skills, knowledge and abilities. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Whitney Wild on Tuesday, Cheatle\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cWhat happened is a terrible incident and should never happen.\u201d \u201cAnd we are obviously going to make sure moving forward we take whatever any lessons that come out of this and adjust accordingly,\u201d she added. Associations that represent women in law enforcement reacted to the\u00a0unfounded attacks on female agents\u00a0with disappointment and alarm. \u201cStatements blaming this shooting on efforts to promote gender equity are disingenuous at best and deeply dangerous at worst,\u201d a group of associations, including Women in Federal Law Enforcement, International Association of Women Police, and National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives, said in a statement. Research, they said, has shown that efforts to expand the pool of qualified applicants for law enforcement positions \u201cmakes us all safer and say they do not advocate for hiring solely based on gender or lowering standards in any way.\u201d \u201cWe must reject all bad-faith efforts to seek to score political points at the expense of our safety. This is the most recent effort to sow division and blame by attacking diversity initiatives for everything from airline safety catastrophes to bridge collapse to bank failures,\u201d the groups said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/media/secret-service-agents-women-trump-shooting/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

That\u2019s 55% cheaper than ordering the items individually. Like McDonald\u2019s, Burger King is offering a $5 meal bundle where customers can select one of three kinds of burgers to pair with chicken nuggets and a beverage. But just how much value is there in these kinds of \u201cvalue\u201d meals? Well, actually, not as much as you may think, since prices for many key ingredients used in value meals are coming down. In other words: You\u2019re paying the going rate (or more). Cheese, potatoes and tomatoes are getting cheaper Many of the recently announced value meals use cheese, potatoes and tomatoes. Compared to last June, cheese prices are down 2.1%, tomato prices are down 1.1% and potato prices are down 3.9%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 latest Consumer Price Index report released Thursday. On a monthly basis, cheese prices didn\u2019t change in June. Tomato and potato prices slid by 0.3% and 3.3%, respectively, when adjusting for seasonality. Meat eaters benefit the most from the value meal war If you eat meat, you\u2019re more likely to benefit from some value menu items. That\u2019s because meat prices are up 3.5% for the year. From May to June, though, meat prices fell by 0.3%. Beef prices were among the steepest price increases across all meat categories tracked in the CPI. For instance, beef roast prices are up 10% and ground beef prices are up 4.5% compared to last June. Pork prices are also up 3.8% compared to a year ago. But prices are a bit lower compared to last month. Chicken prices rose more modestly over the course of the year, up just 0.5%. On a monthly basis, they fell by 0.2% in June. Given that meat prices are rising at a faster pace than most foods, it\u2019s no wonder most fast-food chains are only offering value menus for a limited time. In effect, they\u2019re maintaining their ability to raise prices in the future. But for the time being, Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald\u2019s USA, said value meals aren\u2019t a loss leader for the company and that \u201cwe are totally comfortable with the profitability of it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a way to really bring value and affordability to our customers at a time when the consumer is really stretched,\u201d he said at a conference hosted by The Wall Street Journal last month. Dining out remains a luxury for many Another consideration: It\u2019s a lot more expensive to dine out than cook at home. That shouldn\u2019t be surprising since there are a lot more costs associated with dining out \u2014 one of the biggest being labor \u2014 that aren\u2019t incurred at home. But you\u2019re likely to experience more sticker shock dining out than shopping at grocery stores. Last month, food prices overall rose by 0.2% from May. For the year, food prices are up 2.2%. Food in stores cost 1.1% more compared to a year ago, and those prices are up 0.1% on a monthly basis. Menu prices at restaurants and cafes are up 4.1% annually and 0.4% from May to June.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/economy/fast-food-value-meal-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_media_biden-mental-fitness", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s White House repeatedly and aggressively shot down reports\u00a0on\u00a0the president\u2019s age and any possible limitations\u00a0on his ability to perform all the duties of his office. But after his shaky debate performance last week, in which Biden routinely struggled to\u00a0get his point across, some in the White House press corps say they wish they had pushed harder to tell the story. In June, when the Wall Street Journal published a\u00a0lengthy piece\u00a0on President Joe Biden\u2019s mental\u00a0state, the newspaper\u00a0got\u00a0slammed.\u00a0The White House, its allies, and\u00a0some in the media\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources\u00a0\u2013\u00a0criticized the Journal for quoting mostly Republican political foes on the record, who had a clear political motive to damage Biden\u2019s image. No Democrats were quoted on the record making those allegations, and several Democrats complained their on-the-record quotes praising Biden\u2019s sharpness were not included. The\u00a0Journal defended its reporting at the time. Last week\u2019s debate on CNN laid bare many of the concerns the Journal\u2019s reporting had raised \u2013 that the president has good days and bad days but can sometimes seem to slip up. A New York Times report on Tuesday raised similar concerns by those who have recently been in the room with Biden. The Times reported Biden has more frequent \u201clapses,\u201d although at other times he appears sharp. After Biden\u2019s lackluster performance last week, some are questioning whether the White House press corps dropped the ball on fully covering Biden\u2019s limitations. Biden\u2019s\u00a0age issue is not secret or new. Nearly every media outlet has reported on\u00a0growing concerns about\u00a0Biden\u2019s age well before the debate. The White House in the past has complained that the coverage is disproportionate, and that the media is spending more time covering Biden\u2019s age than his accomplishments as president versus former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies. The media has faced accusations that it has not covered Biden\u2019s mental fitness more aggressively because it wants to prop up the campaign in some way \u2013 an accusation the White House reporters CNN spoke to denied. Several White House reporters\u00a0told CNN that\u00a0the\u00a0coverage\u00a0of Biden\u2019s age and his mental stamina\u00a0should have\u00a0pushed harder. They cited several difficulties in doing so before the debate \u2013 from the obvious political motivations of sources who either want to protect Biden\u2019s image or project a certain image, to the blowback from pursuing such reports, especially from the White House and Democrats. A difficult task Like all past presidents, Biden has good days and bad days. It\u00a0can be tricky to report on something as difficult to define as a person aging, when his opponent\u00a0is a convicted felon, who regularly lies and has threatened to use the government to go after his political opponents. Still, some reporters said the press corps\u00a0could\u00a0have done a better job\u00a0covering\u00a0Biden\u2019s physical and mental state. The failure of the media, one White House reporter said,\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0pushing more aggressively\u00a0into Biden\u2019s abilities after the release of the Robert Hurr report in February, which called Biden a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d Biden\u2019s age was also a right-wing talking point for years, something the White House was quick to point out to reporters,\u00a0which\u00a0may have inadvertently turned off any serious investigation. For example, deceptively edited clips of Biden from the G7 spread widely by right-wing media figures were made to seem as though he was aimlessly \u201cwandering off\u201d from fellow world leaders when really, he was speaking to parachutists who had just landed during a demonstration. \u201cThe right-wing media was calling him senile from day one, and that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cThen whenever you report on the age you were in some ways solidifying, giving credence to some people that were actually of bad faith.\u201d All the White House reporters who spoke to CNN for this piece chose to speak anonymously so they could speak more freely about their relationship with the White House. Keeping the president at a distance Reporters said the White House has not made the press corps\u2019 job easy:\u00a0The White House has put up guardrails around Biden, they say, and\u00a0he does not engage in as many interviews or planned press conferences\u00a0as previous presidents. At those events,\u00a0the press might be able to gauge how he\u2019s doing on the spot, without prepared remarks. \u201cThey keep him at arm\u2019s length, and he rarely does extended interviews,\u201d the reporter said of the White House,\u00a0although he acknowledged Biden has started giving more interviews as of late. Biden has done fewer interviews and formal press conferences than his most recent predecessors, according to data compiled by\u00a0Martha Joynt Kumar,\u00a0professor emerita of political science at Towson University who chronicles the presidents\u2019 interactions with the press. But on quick and informal interactions with the press, like shouted questions on the way to his helicopter or plane, Biden\u00a0as of this week has had 588 interactions, Kumar reports, second only to Trump when compared to recent presidents. But those interactions are not the same as an extended press conference, reporters noted. On Tuesday, ABC News announced Biden would sit down with George Stephanopoulos for an interview, his first since the debate. The White House press shop has also been very \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cfairly successful\u201d in mitigating coverage of concerns over the president\u2019s age,\u00a0said\u00a0another White House reporter who works for a different publication. \u201c[B]erating reporters who bring them reporting about age concerns, bemoaning that it\u2019s all anyone writes about (clearly, it\u2019s not) and often attacking pieces after they run,\u201d the reporter told CNN. \u201cI think that\u2019s left some folks to conclude that these stories are too painful to report or that they should pick their spots more. It\u2019s clear the age stories that have angered the White House (and the liberal Twittersphere) the most.\u201d Alex Thompson, a White House reporter for Axios, said on CNN the day after the debate that \u201cthe White House\u2019s response every single time\u00a0it\u00a0has come up for three-and-a-half years has been to deflect, to gaslight, to not tell the truth \u2013 not just to reporters, not just to other Democrats, but even at times to themselves about the president\u2019s limitations at his age.\u201d Still, this White House\u2019s recent conduct with reporters pales in comparison to Trump\u2019s team, which has done everything from revoking press access to reporters they disagree with, to calling reporters the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d The White House declined to comment. Aging doesn\u2019t happen all at once Aging is also not a sudden moment.\u00a0That makes it trickier to report on. \u201cTo some extent, the decline has appeared to be gradual \u2014 hard to notice from day to day \u2014 and that\u2019s perhaps made it harder for reporters to determine when is the right moment to write something,\u201d one of the reporters said. Just a few days before the debate, Biden held a press conference at the G7 alongside Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelensky that passed off without anything of note in Biden\u2019s demeanor. But reporters pointed out (and have published stories noting) that the president has been using teleprompters at most big events, even fundraisers where in the past he might not have. He has also started to use the lower stairs to board Air Force One. Last year, The New York Times published a lengthy piece on the \u201ccomplicated reality of America\u2019s oldest president,\u201d which looked at some of those accommodations and concerns for his age, but also the moments where he showed stamina and vigor. Some reporters said that there has been a distinct change\u00a0within the last year, and that the press corps should have reported more aggressively on the accommodations made for the president. \u201cI think the press, most of the White House press, did suffer from a bit of lack of curiosity,\u201d one of the reporters said. Look who you\u2019re up against Biden\u2019s allies will often question coverage of the president\u2019s age, questioning why reporters focus on the president\u2019s age and mental lucidity and not on Trump\u2019s\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who, at 78,\u00a0was observed falling asleep during his hush money trial, has made his own major verbal flubs and bizarre statements, and regularly spouts complete falsehoods. \u201cIt makes sense to reflect on this now and ask whether we missed or, really, under-reported the story of Biden\u2019s age and decline. But it\u2019s complicated,\u201d one of the reporters said. \u201cThe fact that the political alternative to Biden is an authoritarian who sparked an insurrection and is a convicted felon does not mean that the press is failing American democracy to focus on Biden\u2019s obvious frailty.\u201d One of the reporters said the media can, and do, report on both. Biden\u2019s allies, however, say too much attention is placed on Biden\u2019s age and not on the threat Trump could pose to American democracy. But the reporters say they can, and should, do both. \u201cJust because you are reporting on Biden age, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not reporting on Trump\u2019s lies.\u00a0 I find that argument silly, and it seems one design towards like producing a certain outcome in the election, rather than like an honest reporting,\u201d one of the reporters said. The outlets that had received harsh blowback for their previous reports on Biden\u2019s lucidity now feel justified. A source familiar with the staff behind the Wall Street Journal\u2019s report said that when the piece first published, the reporters were approached by people with sympathy asking how they\u2019re doing \u201cas if something terrible had just happened,\u201d the source said. After the debate, the reporters started to get messages saying they were right.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/media/biden-mental-fitness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_07_17_economy_donald-trump-jerome-powell", "text": "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would not fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell if the former president wins the election in November, according to a Bloomberg interview published Tuesday. But Trump\u2019s statement wasn\u2019t exactly a promise, saying he\u2019d let Powell finish up his second term, \u201cespecially if I thought he was doing the right thing.\u201d Of course, his statement also assumes it would be technically possible for a sitting president to oust any Fed official. Powell, a registered Republican, was first tapped to helm the central bank by Trump in 2017. Trump sang Powell\u2019s praises at the time, saying \u201che\u2019s strong, he\u2019s committed, he\u2019s smart.\u201d Trump doesn\u2019t have that same rosy view of his central bank appointee any more and has repeatedly attacked the current Fed chief, even accusing him earlier this year of planning to cut interest rates just to help Democratic politicians win elections (though there isn\u2019t any evidence of that). The former president has made it clear he will not reappoint Powell if he clinches the White House in November. Trump\u2019s ire toward Powell goes as far back as 2018 when the Fed raised rates, which sparked chatter even then as to whether or not Trump could even fire Powell. However, if Trump changes his mind outright because he thinks Powell isn\u2019t doing \u201cthe right thing\u201d and does try to remove him, it could kick off a messy uphill battle. The law states that a sitting president can dismiss any Fed official, but only for \u201ccause,\u201d not because of policy differences. That still wouldn\u2019t stop Trump from pushing to oust Powell before the Fed head\u2019s term concludes in 2026. Powell\u2019s willingness to fight back through the courts would also be key in determining whether or not a president does have the power to fire the Fed chair, which would eventually reach the nation\u2019s highest court. \u201cOne of the few Supreme Court precedents on the president\u2019s authority to fire a member of a body created by Congress came from William Humphrey, an aggrieved conservative commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission, who was fired by Franklin Roosevelt in 1933 over policy differences,\u201d the Brookings Institution wrote in a 2018 analysis. \u201cHe sued for reinstatement and even though he died while the litigation was pending, the Supreme Court still\u00a0took up\u00a0his case. (This is why the case is called\u00a0Humphrey\u2019s Executor: His estate carried on after Mr. Humphrey\u2019s demise.) The estate won. The Supreme Court would have to decide whether the same logic applies to the chair of the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors.\u201d The Fed is an independent government institution, guided by its two mandates of price stability and maximum employment. It answers to Congress, not the US president, according to the law that established the central bank. The only influence the president has over the Fed is the ability to appoint the seven officials who serve on the central bank\u2019s board of governors, including the chair, which is still subject to approval by the US Senate.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/economy/donald-trump-jerome-powell/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft.

{"id": "2024_07_17_tech_social-media-trump-assassination", "text": "The social media industry\u2019s tepid response this week to the conspiracy theories floating wildly on their platforms about the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump was part of a purposeful shift away from actively policing online speech \u2013 even in the face of potentially dangerous rhetoric. The reaction could not be more different from 2021, in wake of the country\u2019s last brush with political violence.\u00a0That does not bode well for the coming election \u2013 or its aftermath. Three years ago, major online platforms including Meta, Twitter and YouTube took swift action to keep the attack on America\u2019s democracy on January 6 from spiraling online \u2013 suspending thousands of accounts that had promoted election lies, extending a pause on political advertising and removing posts that praised the US Capitol attack, among other moves. In stark contrast, however, social media platforms over the past few days have been overrun by false claims about the attempt on Trump\u2019s life, ranging from baseless left-wing speculation that the incident had been \u201cstaged\u201d for Trump\u2019s own political benefit to right-wing conspiracy theories falsely suggesting \u201cdeep state\u201d government agents or perhaps President Joe Biden himself had somehow orchestrated the attack. The incident was not staged. The US Secret Service has described it as an assassination attempt and the Department of Homeland Security has acknowledged it as a security failure. Investigators are still searching for the shooter\u2019s motive. And Biden condemned political violence following the attack, pledging an independent investigation into the security lapse as well. Big Tech CEOs have universally echoed Biden\u2019s remarks. But amid the torrent of conspiracy theorizing, the social media platforms have been largely silent about their own role in how the event has played out online, reflecting a sharp departure from their previous hands-on approach to containing the spread of falsehoods that, left unchecked, could risk fueling further conflict. None of the country\u2019s largest social media platforms responded to repeated questions from CNN over multiple days this week about what actions they have taken in response to misinformation and conspiracy theories circulating about the Trump rally shooting. Meta, Google, TikTok and X did not respond. Only Snapchat issued a statement saying it is designed \u201cdifferently from traditional social media\u201d in that it doesn\u2019t offer a curated news feed \u201cwhere users can broadcast false information.\u201d The steadfast silence from tech platforms underscores how significantly industry giants have shifted in the past three years to embrace a more hands-off approach \u2014 in their latest attempt to juggle, in real time, competing values of free expression, online safety and political neutrality. And what the public experienced on social media in the moments after the attack on Trump is a sign of what\u2019s to come, said Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a social media watchdog group that advocates for tighter regulation of the platforms. \u201cThis should be a hint,\u201d Ahmed said, \u201cthat the months ahead are going to be just as unedifying, as stultifyingly stupid and as confusing as the last few days have been on social media.\u201d How did we get here? A dizzying array of factors have combined to create today\u2019s more toxic information environment. Most visibly, Elon Musk\u2019s purchase of Twitter, now known as X, has transformed what was once the premier social media destination for breaking news into a messier, less trustworthy platform. Musk has made multiple interlocking decisions around account verification, payments to creators, and whom to allow on the platform that have degraded users\u2019 ability to trust each other and what they see there, misinformation researchers have long said.\u00a0And he has erected barriers to independent accountability by forcing researchers to pay astronomical fees for access to the platform\u2019s data. Users on X are now being financially rewarded for posting the most inflammatory, engaging content regardless of its accuracy or truthfulness. Although Musk has touted X\u2019s crowdbased fact-checking feature, Community Notes, as a bulwark against misinformation, it has been widely criticized as slow and ineffective. On Tuesday, CCDH published new research finding that of 100 top-performing conspiracy theory posts on X about Trump\u2019s shooting, only five contained a Community Note refuting a false claim. The posts collectively garnered more than 215 million views on X, according to CCDH. Soon after Musk bought the platform, he laid off roughly 80% of Twitter\u2019s pre-acquisition headcount. The deep cuts affected the company\u2019s trust and safety team responsible for safeguarding the platform and, in a separate move, Musk eliminated Twitter\u2019s trust and safety council of outside experts. But X wasn\u2019t alone in reducing investments in trust and safety. Industrywide, companies cited tough macroeconomic conditions to justify sweeping layoffs that in some cases have hit trust and safety teams. In 2019, Snapchat had 763 employees working on trust and safety, a number that grew to more than 3,000 by 2021, the company told Congress this year. But by 2023, that figure had fallen 27% to 2,226.\u00a0Meta and TikTok told lawmakers they each employ roughly 40,000 safety employees but did not disclose how that number has changed over time. Social media companies retreated in other ways, too, from YouTube deciding to once again allow lies about the 2020 election on its platform to Meta deciding to stop amplifying news, politics and social issues in its curated feeds altogether. \u201cMeta decided that it can\u2019t profitably deliver civic content,\u201d said Laura Edelson, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University and the co-director of Cybersecurity for Democracy, a research group focused on digital misinformation.\u00a0\u201cIt can\u2019t make a safe social media product that does politics and civic stuff, and so it just got out of that business.\u201d Baybars Orsek, managing director of the fact-checking organization Logically Facts, said these and other changes by social media platforms have made working with them in the last few years more challenging. \u201cIt is concerning to see that some platforms have chosen to distance themselves from political discourse rather than enforce transparent and scalable policies to protect free speech while maintaining a safe information environment,\u201d Orsek told CNN. It isn\u2019t just the companies\u2019 own business decisions driving the shift. Since the 2020 election, researchers who study digital platforms have increasingly reported being harassed and intimidated, in some cases by US lawmakers who have baselessly alleged they are part of a government-led pressure campaign to silence right-wing speech on social media. For years, some conservatives have said, the US government in regular meetings and emails with social media companies has pressured platforms to remove Covid-19 and election misinformation in violation of Americans\u2019 First Amendment rights. Those claims reached a climax this year at the Supreme Court, where, in a closely watched ruling, a 6-3 majority declined to say that government efforts to persuade platforms to remove posts is unconstitutional. The decision effectively means the US government can continue\u00a0to flag misinformation threats to social media companies in the runup to the 2024 election. But it is still up to the companies to decide what to do with that information. And the Trump rally shooting now raises fresh questions about their willingness to act on it, especially against the backdrop of a sustained effort by right-wing social media critics to discredit trust and safety work and misinformation research. How this all played out on Saturday The combination of all these factors led to ripe conditions for a misinformation maelstrom surrounding the Trump assassination attempt. The incident touched off an intense demand for information. Mainstream media outlets, taking\u00a0care to\u00a0report only credible\u00a0answers, were initially slower to report what was happening than the breakneck pace of social media speculation. That led to what researchers call an information void: a gap between what is known and what audiences want to know. Meta\u2019s decision not to amplify news and politics in curated feeds \u2013 part of a broader industry retrenchment on trust and safety driven by internal business pressures and external cultural ones \u2013\u00a0may have helped prevent some people from going down algorithmically recommended rabbit holes, at least on company-owned platforms. But in the minutes after the shooting, some Threads users complained that mentions of the incident could not immediately be found on the site, in direct contrast to X \u2013 where, thanks in part\u00a0to Musk\u2019s prior decisions \u2013\u00a0conspiratorial thinking was already flowing fast and free. Meta\u2019s pullback from promoting news\u00a0content likely contributed to the information void, Edelson said, as it failed to sufficiently elevate authoritative reporting and likely drove users into the arms of conspiracy theorists on other platforms. The decision highlights the difficult tradeoffs of managing a fast-moving information ecosystem, said Orsek. \u201cThe lack of stringent content moderation on X has led to a proliferation of misinformation, whereas Meta\u2019s more conservative strategy has resulted in less immediate information [on its platforms], both verified and unverified,\u201d Orsek said. (The Verge reported Saturday that Meta did appear to be surfacing news outlets\u2019 reporting about the shooting in Facebook search results, but that it inconsistently showed conspiracy-related content at the top of its trending topic on Threads for the incident.) Meanwhile, Edelson added, TikTok also emerged as a key spreader of misinformation due to the way its recommendation algorithm surfaced videos it believed would resonate with users, rather than primarily authoritative information. For other social media users, the episode highlighted how X remains the platform of choice for following big breaking news events online, even if the quality of the information is degraded. And the near-instant calcification of pro-Trump and anti-Trump false narratives surrounding the shooting shows how Americans are primed to look at the same event through completely different lenses, irrespective of the underlying facts. The eagerness with which people on the right and, increasingly, on the left have embraced misleading claims linked to the shooting is a worrying sign for civil discourse and democracy, some researchers say. That includes Alicia Wanless, director of the Information Environment Project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who has been researching how people create their own realities from the information they consume and the technology they use. \u201cI\u2019ve been finding a pattern that after new technologies change how humans can produce and share information,\u201d Wanless said, it leads to clashes of different realities in which supporters of various sides and ideologies try to do ever more to convince audiences that their narrative is the truth. Historically, if the tension between realities can\u2019t be resolved, Wanless warned, it often leads to violence. \u201cAll my case studies led up to conflict,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/tech/social-media-trump-assassination/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_business_musk-trump-support", "text": "At first glance Elon Musk and Donald Trump wouldn\u2019t seem to be natural allies. One has made cutting greenhouse emissions a major business selling point. The other questions the need to cut emissions at all, denouncing most forms of clean energy as at best unnecessary and at worst destructive. One wants to move away from fossil fuels and convert all car sales worldwide to electric vehicles. The other believes EVs will be an economic disaster for America and that the nation should to produce and burn more oil. But as of Saturday, Musk is now publicly endorsing Trump\u2019s presidential reelection bid. And the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported Monday that Musk is now planning on supporting Trump\u2019s presidential campaign by committing $45 million a month to a new super PAC backing the former president. The donations, if they come to pass, are a significant development in not only the presidential campaign, but also the relationship between the two men, who both have fervent support among millions of fans who stand ready to believe most anything they say. Musk has given money to candidates from both parties in the past, including $5,000 to Barack Obama in April of 2011. He used to be primarily a Democratic donor, but those relatively paltry sums pale in comparison to the amount he is now reportedly donating to the Republican presidential candidate. He has said for several years the Democratic party has moved too far to the left for him to support many of its candidates. Musk didn\u2019t comment directly on the Journal report, but he did use a meme of people dressed as African wildebeests with the title \u201cFake Gnus,\u201d suggesting the report was incorrect. And he tweeted soon after the assassination attempt on Trump Saturday \u201cI fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.\u201d But Musk responded \u201cyeah\u201d to an account he interacts with frequently, @EndWokeness, which said that Musk \u201cwent from being an Obama voter to pledging $180 million to elect DJT. The woke left really f*cked up. Badly.\u201d The super PAC, called America PAC, aims to help register voters, persuade people to vote early and to ask for mail-in ballots in swing states, one person told the Journal. Beyond his financial support for the Trump campaign, Musk, with 190 million followers on his platform X, is possibly one of the world\u2019s most-followed \u201cinfluencers,\u201d in addition to having the greatest net worth on the planet. He has millions of fans \u2013 a recent Tesla annual meeting had the feeling of its own political rally, with shareholders telling him things like \u201cWe love you all from our bottom of the heart, we love you so much, Elon.\u201d The shareholders at that meeting voted 84% in favor of restoring the most lucrative pay package ever given to a CEO, with stock options worth $48 billion at the time of the meeting. A judge in Delaware had previously stripped him of that package. Asked at that meeting about his relationship with Trump, and Trump having nice things to say about Tesla even as he attacks EVs, Musk replied, \u201cI can be persuasive.\u201d \u201cI mean, I have had some conversations with him and he just called me out of the blue for no reason, I don\u2019t know why, but he does,\u201d Musk continued. \u201cAnd it\u2019s like he\u2019s very nice when he calls and I was like, electric cars, I think are pretty good for the future. America is the leader in electric cars, buy American stuff. And I think he actually \u2013 a lot of his friends now have Teslas and they all love it. And he\u2019s a huge fan of the Cybertruck. So I think those may be contributing factors, yeah.\u201d Relations haven\u2019t always been so friendly between the two. Musk quit two White House business councils he served on early in 2017 after Trump announced America would withdraw from Paris climate accord. \u201cClimate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\u201d he tweeted at that time. But for the last several years Musk has repeatedly shown support for Trump \u2013 or opposition to President Joe Biden. Soon after Musk purchased the social media platform then known as Twitter in the fall of 2022, he restored Trump\u2019s Twitter account. He has complained that Twitter was improperly censoring anti-Biden stories under its previous ownership, although Twitters\u2019s own lawyers later challenged that conclusion in a court filing. Tesla, the greatest source of Musk\u2019s planet-leading net worth, has benefited from subsidies passed under the Biden Administration, providing tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV buyers. But those tax credits also help established automakers seeking to sell their own EVs. Musk recently tweeted the EV subsidies passed under Biden actually helped its rivals more than Tesla. \u201cTake away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,\u201d he tweeted early Tuesday. \u201cAlso, remove subsidies from all industries!\u201d While Musk is right that some of the industries he criticizes, specifically coal and oil, receive their own massive government subsidies, his tweet doesn\u2019t acknowledge that much of his wealth has come from government support of Tesla and SpaceX, one of his other companies that depends upon government contracts to operate.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/business/musk-trump-support/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_economy_weo-imf-interest-rates-inflation", "text": "The International Monetary Fund has warned that stubborn inflation could keep interest rates higher for longer than expected, increasing fiscal and financial risks around the world. Persistently high prices for services \u2014 which include haircuts, hotels and restaurants \u2014 as well as escalating trade tensions are propping up inflation and raising the prospect that interest rates will stay high for a while yet, the IMF cautioned Tuesday in its latest World Economic Outlook. The warning highlights that the global economy is not yet in the clear when it comes to inflation, which explains the caution on the part of central banks in cutting interest rates. High borrowing costs, in turn, are prolonging the squeeze on household and business finances. Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said central bank officials in the United States needed \u201cgreater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably\u201d toward their 2% target before going ahead with the first interest rate cut. The Bank of England, meanwhile, held off on cutting rates last month even though UK inflation slowed to the central bank\u2019s 2% target in May. However, services inflation came in higher than expected. The Bank of England emphasized that \u201cmonetary policy needs to be restrictive for an extended period of time until the risk of inflation becoming embedded above the 2% target dissipates.\u201d In its report Tuesday, the IMF said it still expected major central banks to reduce borrowing costs in the second half of the year. It anticipates one cut by the Fed before the end of the year, chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told journalists. The IMF thinks global inflation will slow to 5.9% this year, from 6.7% last year, in line with its forecast in April. The agency blamed sticky services price inflation \u2014 partly driven by higher wages \u2014 for \u201cholding up progress\u201d on reducing overall inflation. \u201cEnergy and food price inflation are now almost back to pre-pandemic levels in many countries, while overall inflation is not,\u201d Gourinchas said. \u201cRising services prices and wages may keep overall inflation higher than desired,\u201d posing a \u201csignificant risk\u201d to economic growth, he added. Tariffs will hurt living standards The IMF also noted that rising trade tensions \u201ccould further raise near-term risks to inflation by increasing the cost of imported goods.\u201d The US and the European Union have in recent months hiked tariffs on electric cars made in China, driven by concerns that local jobs and strategic industries could be wiped out by cheap Chinese imports. The US has also increased tariffs on a raft of other products from the world\u2019s no. 2 economy, including steel, batteries, semiconductors and critical minerals. Gourinchas said the \u201csurge in unilateral measures,\u201d including tariffs, was a \u201ckey concern\u201d for the IMF. \u201cIf anything, it will distort trade and resource allocation, spur retaliation, weaken growth, diminish living standards and make it harder to coordinate policies that address global challenges, such as the climate transition,\u201d he added. The IMF sees the global economy expanding 3.2% this year, as it forecast in April. But the agency downgraded its forecast for US growth to 2.6% \u2014 0.1 percentage point lower than projected in April. The economy encompassing the 20 countries that use the euro is seen expanding by a \u201cmodest\u201d 0.9%, 0.1 percentage point higher than predicted in April. The IMF also made upward revisions to its 2024 growth forecasts for India and China, which it now expects to expand by 7% and 5% respectively \u2014 up from forecasts of 6.8% and 4.6% in April. The projected growth in the two countries would account for half of global expansion. \u201cAsia\u2019s emerging market economies remain the main engine for the global economy,\u201d Gourinchas said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/economy/weo-imf-interest-rates-inflation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
