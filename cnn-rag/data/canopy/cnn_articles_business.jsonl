{"id": "2024_05_29_investing_graceland-scam", "text": "In yet another twist in the bizarre story of the dubious foreclosure threat against Elvis Presley\u2019s iconic Memphis home, a person purporting to be involved in a scheme to steal Graceland responded to an email from CNN, claiming responsibility for the scam. \u201cI didn\u2019t win this one. I\u2019ve stole (sic) many identities and received monies, we don\u2019t win all,\u201d wrote the self-proclaimed scammer in a mixture of English and Luganda, a language spoken by more than 5 million people primarily in Uganda, according to the United Nations. As with all scammers, it\u2019s unclear whether the person who emailed CNN is actually behind the scheme. But they responded to a CNN request for comment sent to an email address associated with Naussany Investments and Private Lending, a company that tried to foreclose on the famous mansion last week. Graceland was set to go up for auction under the pretext that the late singer\u2019s daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, who died in 2023, failed to pay back a $3.8 million loan she\u2019d secured from\u00a0 Naussany Investments before her passing, and had used Graceland as collateral, according to court documents. But actress Riley Keough, Elvis\u2019 granddaughter and heir, sued to protect the estate from the auction block, alleging fraud and saying Naussany didn\u2019t exist and had no rights to the property. The foreclosure sale was ultimately blocked, and Naussany Investments dropped its foreclosure efforts. A self-proclaimed scam artist CNN reached out to the email address listed as the company representative in Keough\u2019s lawsuit for comment. That person said his company had no claims against anyone affiliated with Graceland and directed CNN to a different email address \u2013 gregoryenaussanyniplflorida@hotmail.com \u2013 supposedly belonging to a person named Gregory Naussany, who responded when contacted by CNN. Other news outlets, including the New York Times, which first reported on the alleged scammer\u2019s admission Tuesday, received similar messages from the same email address. A Luganda-speaking native translated and reviewed the email for CNN. When asked whether the self-proclaimed scammer appeared to be a native speaker or was perhaps using a tool like Google Translate to pose as one, the translator found that while the apparent scammer knew the language, their writing style showed they were not entirely fluent. CNN has been unable to find any evidence to prove the company actually exists. The phone number listed in court documents was not in service. The business was listed in a court document as being located in Kimberling City, Missouri. But the secretary of state had no record of a business by that name when contacted by CNN. The Shelby County Registrar told CNN in an email that \u201cNaussany Investments & Private Lending, LLC, does not have any filings in the Office of the Shelby County Register of Deeds pertaining to Graceland/Elvis Presley.\u201d The self-identified scammer told the New York Times they are based in Nigeria and targeted groups including the dead and elderly. They especially went after victims in Florida and California, using sensitive documents like birth certificates to facilitate their schemes, according to the Times article. \u201cWe use innocents and we steal identity,\u201d said the scammer in an email to CNN. What would lead a scammer to go after the second most visited residence in the US behind the White House remains unknown. \u201cWe figure out how to steal,\u201d the scammer told the Times. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do.\u201d It was a mistake to target Graceland, said Mark Sunderman, a real estate professor at the University of Memphis. \u201cWhy they went after such a high-profile piece of property, that was just very stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, in terms of Memphis, I can\u2019t think of anything more high profile other than if they tried to go after the Civil Rights Museum.\u201d Court documents show Naussany Investments offered to settle its claimed debt with the Presley estate for $2.85 million, a reduction of $950,000 from the original loan.\u00a0 Sunderman believes that quick payoff may have been the scammer\u2019s goal, not a successful foreclosure on Graceland. \u201cIf they had gone through the foreclosure sale, they would have had much, much greater risk to get caught and had less payoff to them in the long run,\u201d he said. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti last Thursday said he was looking into possible fraud involving the matter. The Shelby County District Attorney did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on any possible criminal case.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/investing/graceland-scam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_media_pat-mcafee-caitlin-clark-backlash", "text": "ESPN host Pat McAfee has apologized for calling Caitlin Clark a \u201cWhite b*tch\u201d during a Monday show segment over whether race has played a factor in the WNBA rookie\u2019s meteoric rise. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have used \u2018white b*itch\u2019 as a descriptor of Caitlin Clark. No matter the context.. even if we\u2019re talking about race being a reason for some of the stuff happening. I have way too much respect for her and women to put that into the universe,\u201d McAfee\u00a0wrote Monday afternoon on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cMy intentions when saying it were complimentary just like the entire segment but, a lot of folks are saying that it certainly wasn\u2019t at all,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s 100% on me and for that I apologize.\u201d McAfee wrote that he had sent an apology to Clark, as well. The apology came hours after McAfee argued on his program, which airs on both ESPN and YouTube, that it is Clark and Clark alone who is behind the WNBA\u2019s surge in popularity this year, contending that some have argued that it\u2019s because she\u2019s a White player that she\u2019s become so popular. McAfee, the former NFL punter turned shock jock, argued that is not the case, outlining Clark\u2019s dominant television ratings, ticket sales and jersey sales in a game show-style segment he called, \u201cGuess Which WNBA Rookie.\u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to say is, what the WNBA currently has is what we like to describe as a cash cow. There is a superstar,\u201d McAfee had said. \u201cBut I would like the media people that continue to say, \u2018This rookie class, this rookie class.\u2019 Nah, just call it for what it is. There is one White b*tch for the Indiana team who is a superstar.\u201d McAfee went on to describe how Clark \u201ccarried\u201d Iowa\u2019s basketball program and shattered NCAA scoring records. \u201cIs there a chance people just enjoy watching her play basketball because of how electrifying she is, what she did what she stood for, how she went about going what she went for?\u201d McAfee said. \u201cMaybe. But instead we have to hear people say we only like her because she\u2019s White, and she\u2019s only popular because the rest of the rookie class is doing what they\u2019re doing. Well, that\u2019s a bunch of bulls**t and we think the WNBA \u2014 more specifically their refs \u2014 need to stop trying to screw her over at every single turn. What you have is somebody special and we\u2019re lucky she\u2019s here in Indiana.\u201d While McAfee\u2019s praise of Clark was effusive, his use of the pejorative term \u201cWhite b*tch\u201d and focus on the race of the players drew backlash, including from some ESPN staffers. \u201cThis is just completely unacceptable,\u201d ESPN analyst Kim Adams\u00a0wrote on X. \u201cInterested to see how ESPN handles it. And his entire argument is not conducive to anything going on in the WNBA right now. Just let the women hoop.\u201d \u201cThe men are not ok,\u201d ESPN WNBA reporter Alexa Philippou\u00a0wrote on X,\u00a0shortly after the segment aired. \u201cBeyond unacceptable,\u201d\u00a0wrote\u00a0The Athletic reporter and NBC sports analyst Nicole Auerbach. \u201cReferring to Caitlin Clark as \u2018the white b*tch for Indiana.\u2019 That\u2019s beyond being too comfortable. Just totally unacceptable,\u201d former ESPN host Jemele Hill\u00a0wrote on X. ESPN declined to comment to CNN on the matter. The Indiana Fever did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The backlash wasn\u2019t the first time McAfee has caused headaches for ESPN. Earlier this year, McAfee ignited a torrent of outrage when he allowed the conspiracy-curious New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers to baselessly suggest during his show that ABC late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel might be named in documents identifying Jeffrey Epstein associates. McAfee later apologized after Kimmel threatened to take legal action and declared Rodgers would no longer appear on the show for the rest of the season. McAfee also went after former ESPN executive Norby Williamson, accusing the network veteran of \u201csabotage\u201d and calling him a \u201crat,\u201d alleging he leaked false information about McAfee\u2019s show. Just a few months after those attacks, Williamson departed the network. Clark, meanwhile, was named the WNBA Rookie of the Month for May. In 11 games, Clark has averaged 15.6 points, 6.4 assists and 5.1 rebounds.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/media/pat-mcafee-caitlin-clark-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_cars_catalytic-converter-theft-stealing-auto", "text": "Johnny Wactor, an actor who formerly starred in \u201cGeneral Hospital,\u201d caught people in the act of stealing the catalytic converter from his car Saturday. Tragically, one of the thieves, according to witnesses and Los Angeles police, then shot and killed Wactor. It\u2019s rare for someone to be murdered over a catalytic converter but thefts of this car part remain stunningly frequent. Last year, thieves stole 27,609 catalytic converters in the US, with more than half of those thefts happening in California, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau. That\u2019s down sharply from the more than 64,700 that were stolen in 2022. But, up to last year, catalytic converter thefts had been rising sharply, up by a factor of four, since 2020. It might seem odd that this particular car part would attract so much criminal attention, especially one with such an innocuous purpose. A catalytic converter cleans a car\u2019s exhaust, making the air safer to breathe for all of us. On its website, the US Environmental Protection Agency has called the catalytic converter \u201cone of the great environmental inventions of all time.\u201d But it\u2019s not what the catalytic converter does that attracts desperate criminals. It\u2019s what\u2019s inside. Often, there\u2019s platinum, worth more than $1,000 an ounce, palladium, worth nearly as much, and rhodium, worth almost $5,000 per ounce. They react chemically with exhaust gases, breaking down compounds like carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides and small amounts of unburned fuel into less harmful substances. A catalytic converter is a metal cylinder or flattened oval that\u2019s part of the car\u2019s exhaust system. It\u2019s usually underneath the car with an exhaust pipe running in one end and out the other. Inside is a honeycomb-like structure coated in metals far more valuable than gold. Easy to steal Those metals, plus the catalytic converter\u2019s exposed position, make it a target for theft. Also, unlike some other car parts, catalytic converters are usually not marked with a vehicle identification number, making it difficult to track a stolen converter back to an actual theft. Unlike with other car parts that are under the hood, locking a car won\u2019t necessarily deter a catalytic converter thief who can crawl underneath the car and saw through the exhaust pipe. The popularity of SUVs, which are higher off the ground, has made the job even easier. But while those prices sound astoundingly high, they\u2019re actually much lower than they\u2019ve been in recent years. A couple of years ago, rhodium was worth almost $30,000 an ounce. That, plus increased law enforcement around these thefts and higher penalties for those who steal convertors or purchase stolen ones, contributed to recent declines in thefts, according the NICB. Also, as car engines have becoming more efficient and cleaner-burning, catalytic converters have been made smaller and with less metal, said Richard Waitas, a senior manager at the exhaust components company MagnaFlow. There simply isn\u2019t as much dirty exhaust gas they need to clean and this is one reason thieves may target older models. Limiting thefts Some newer cars have at least one catalytic converter \u2013 vehicles can have more than one \u2013 close to the engine where it works more efficiently because it stays hotter, said Waitas. That\u2019s also helped deter some theft because the converter is just harder to reach up close to the engine block. Federal legislation that is currently being considered would require catalytic converters to be marked with identifying numbers so stolen converters could be tracked back to specific cars, making the crime easier to prosecute. The National Automobile Dealers Association is actively pushing for the new law, the Preventing Auto Recycling Theft (PART)\u00a0act, a spokesperson said. Used catalytic converters can sell for anywhere from $25 to $1,000, depending on the metals content, which varies by a vehicles make and model, according to Scott Vollero and Christopher Gaines, who co-founded ScrapCATapp.com, an auction site for used catalytic converters. For the most part, the catalytic converters end up getting sold to recycling companies that strip out the materials to make new catalytic converters. Recycling is far cheaper than relying on new, mined metails, said Waitas. And no matter how old a catylitic converter is, those metals are still there. \u201cThat cat will always contain those metals and all you\u2019ve got to do is go through the process of removing the metals from the substrate and whatever contaminants,\u201d he said. For the the victim, of course, the price is much higher as replacing a catalytic converter can cost more than $2,000 including parts and labor. While it might not sound like it would matter much, getting the catalytic converter stolen can can make a car virtually undrivable. If your catalytic converter is stolen, the first thing you\u2019ll likely notice is the sound. When you start the engine the car will be really loud because, with the exhaust pipe cut, exhaust won\u2019t be channeled through the car\u2019s muffler anymore. Thats the part that reduces, or muffles, engine sound. Then you\u2019ll notice the orange \u201ccheck engine\u201d light and you\u2019ll probably also notice the smell of untreated exhaust fumes wafting up. If you persist in driving, you may also notice uneven acceleration because the engine isn\u2019t being forced to push the exhaust down that long pipe and through the catalytic converter and the muffler, anymore. Since the engine was set up to deal with that back-pressure, not having a working exhaust system will cause performance issues. If this happens, don\u2019t drive the car. Report the theft to police and your car insurance company. Get the catalytic converter replaced. The good news is, these days, it\u2019s at least a little less likely to happen. And electric vehicles, which are gaining market share, don\u2019t have catalytic converters to steal in the first place.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/cars/catalytic-converter-theft-stealing-auto/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_business_zero-down-mortgages-making-a-comeback", "text": "Many Americans would love to buy a home, but they don\u2019t have tens of thousands of dollars to cover a down payment. That massive roadblock is being removed by a\u00a0new zero-percent down mortgage program\u00a0launched two weeks ago by one of the nation\u2019s largest mortgage lenders. However, the new program, offered by United Wholesale Mortgage, is making some experts nervous about how these loans could backfire on homeowners \u2014 especially if home prices stop going to the moon. And for some, it\u2019s bringing back bad memories of the\u00a0subprime mortgage meltdown\u00a0that fueled the 2008 financial crisis. UWM, led by\u00a0Mat Ishbia, the billionaire owner of the Phoenix Suns NBA team, said homebuyers who qualify won\u2019t need to put down an upfront down payment. Instead, the program will allow buyers to pay for 97% of the home\u2019s value with a first mortgage and then provide the remaining 3% (up to $15,000) in the form of a second mortgage. That second mortgage won\u2019t accrue interest, but it will need to be paid back \u2014 in full as a balloon payment \u2014 when the home is sold, the mortgage is paid off or if the owner refinances. \u2018Demand has been huge\u2019 These mortgages are only open to first-time homebuyers and those making no more than 80% of the area\u2019s median income. \u201cThe initial demand has been huge. We already have a couple of thousands of loans submitted,\u201d Alex Elezaj, UWM\u2019s chief strategy officer, told CNN. UWM said that no other wholesale lender or non-bank mortgage company is offering such a program nationally. (UWM is a wholesale lender that connects homebuyers and realtors with mortgage brokers through its Mortgage Matchup platform. Earlier this month, Mortgage Matchup was named the\u00a0first-ever mortgage partner\u00a0of the NBA and WNBA.) Yet some worry that this kind of mortgage could cause problems for homeowners down the line. The central risk is that because they put down no down payment up front, homeowners will be starting with no equity. That means they\u2019d find themselves instantly underwater (owing more than the home is worth) if the red-hot housing market suddenly cools and home values go down. \u201cIt could happen again\u201d That could be a problem if the homeowner needs to sell quickly, perhaps because they lose their job, face financial distress or need to relocate. Suddenly, they\u2019d be on the hook to pay back that second mortgage. And because they\u2019re underwater, the home sale won\u2019t generate enough cash to retire the debt. \u201cIf the homeowner lacks the cash to make up the difference, then he or she will be in default on the second mortgage and at risk of foreclosure and damaged credit,\u201d said Patricia McCoy, a professor at Boston College Law School. That scenario is \u201cexactly what happened during the subprime crisis, when millions of homeowners were underwater on their mortgage and went into default,\u201d said McCoy, a former mortgage regulator at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). \u201cIt happened before and it could happen again.\u201d The housing bubble that popped around 2006 was fueled in part by an explosion of lending to subprime borrowers. In the years leading up to the bubble, lenders came up with new products like adjustable rate mortgages and no down-payment loans that ended up blowing up when home prices eventually collapsed. Locked into high rates? To be sure, right now the housing market is on fire. Home prices are at record highs and demand is so strong that some homes are selling above asking price after all-cash bidding wars. Still, another potential issue is that homeowners could find themselves locked into high-interest mortgage rates if the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates. That\u2019s because in order to refinance at a lower rate, the homeowner would need to fully pay off that second mortgage. And they may not have enough cash to do that. They could also be stuck with higher rates because the lenders won\u2019t let the borrower refinance if they haven\u2019t built up enough equity in the home. There are other options for zero-down mortgages. For instance, Bank of America launched a\u00a0zero-down payment mortgage program\u00a0in 2022 for first-time homebuyers in certain Black and Hispanic neighborhoods. As\u00a0Bankrate\u00a0notes, there are also zero-down home loans backed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) in rural areas as well as loans for veterans and surviving spouses guaranteed by the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). \u2018Read the fine print\u2019 Anneliese Lederer, senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending, said it\u2019s crucial for homeowners considering the UWM loan program to be educated about the terms and conditions. \u201cUsing fun lines like \u2018no-down payment\u2019 sounds exciting and great. But you need to read the fine print,\u201d Lederer said. \u201cThis could be a fantastic product to allow people who can afford the mortgage payment but don\u2019t have the down payment to access homeownership. But the question is: How do you pay off that second mortgage? What is the plan? Right now there is no plan.\u201d Dennis Kelleher, CEO of Better Markets, a nonprofit that advocates for tougher financial regulation, told CNN he worries that a mortgage product like this will hurt some borrowers if the housing market stumbles. \u201cThese mortgages are going to be ticking time bombs \u2013 just like subprime mortgages \u2013unless home prices continue to increase very substantially,\u201d Kelleher said. \u201cThis has the potential to turn the American dream of homeownership almost immediately into a nightmare.\u201d Kelleher noted that although home prices are rising sharply now, there is no guarantee that will continue. Existing home prices jumped by\u00a0another 6% last month year-over-year to $407,600\u00a0\u2014 the highest median price in April on record. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if we are in a bubble that is going to burst or if the trend lines are going to increase,\u201d Kelleher said. \u201cBut pushing 100% mortgage products on low-income people when housing prices are at historic highs should cause everybody to be very concerned.\u201d Lessons of the subprime crisis Jonathan Adams, an assistant professor at Saint Joseph\u2019s University teaching real estate finance, said the UWM loan program has \u201call the features that made subprime bad.\u201d UWM pushed back on these concerns, noting that borrowers must still go through strict underwriting guidelines. \u201cPeople who make these claims are uneducated about the current state of the industry,\u201d said Elezaj, the UWM executive. \u201cIn today\u2019s environment, UWM is responsible for underwriting the loan, which gives us confidence that these are high quality loans.\u201d \u201cThis is a huge positive. It\u2019s helping consumers and is a great win across the board,\u201d Elezaj said. \u201cThink about all the people who are renting and would love to buy a house, but they face this roadblock of coming up with $10,000 or $15,000 for a down payment. This eliminates that.\u201d It\u2019s also worth noting that some experts say lending standards have been improved significantly since the 2008 financial crisis. The days of\u00a0NINJA loans\u00a0(no-income, no job, no assets) and adjustable-rate mortgages are largely gone. \u201cWe\u2019re not going back to 2006 here,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. \u201cLending standards are light years removed from pre-crisis when there oftentimes weren\u2019t any standards at all.\u201d Yet Adams, a former Wall Street analyst, cautioned that someone who can\u2019t make a down payment and makes less than 80% of the median income (those that qualify for this loan program) is likely to suffer more in an economy when home prices are falling. \u201cOne of the lessons of the subprime crisis,\u201d Adams said, \u201cwas that you are\u00a0not\u00a0doing any favors to borrowers by making it too easy to borrow.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/business/zero-down-mortgages-making-a-comeback/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_economy_detroit-michigan-central-station", "text": "For more than 35 years, Michigan Central Station has lain dormant, towering above Detroit\u2019s Corktown neighborhood as a harsh and stoic reminder of the city\u2019s economic pain. The 18-story monolith that at one point was the tallest railroad station in the world had fallen derelict, its once opulent halls tattooed with graffiti, stripped for parts, and left scorched and broken. Ronald Butler, who had a 20-year career with the Detroit Fire Department, recalled responding to fires there after it closed in 1988. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been known as the busiest firefighting department in the country,\u201d Butler said. \u201cA lot of that was from buildings being burned by people who needed to get out of a property or burn a property for insurance.\u201d \u201cThere was a sense of hopelessness,\u201d he added. When Detroit became the largest municipality to go bankrupt in 2013, it had fallen hard from its glory days of the early to mid 20th century, when Henry Ford\u2019s arrival and creation of the first-ever moving assembly line vaulted the city into a manufacturing hub and the automotive capital of the world. Now, Michigan Central Station, the neighboring old Book Depository and Butler himself are all symbols of hope for Detroit\u2019s future and its ongoing economic resurgence. Last year, the rehabbed depository was opened to house a blossoming batch of mobility and energy startups, including one helmed by Butler, who started Energy Storage Safety Products International, which makes fire mitigation and prevention technologies for lithium ion batteries. Later this week, Michigan Central Station will reopen to the public as a mixed-used building following a six-year renovation and nearly $1 billion of investment from the Ford Motor Company and its founding family. \u201cCorktown is a very vibrant neighborhood, it\u2019s the oldest neighborhood in Detroit, but there was 30 acres, including this incredible old train station that was literally sitting abandoned and looming over the city as a reminder of the rise and fall of Detroit,\u201d said Mary Culler, a longtime Ford executive and director of the Michigan Central Station innovation district. \u201cIt was a massive project and needed some incredible vision; but \u2026 when I think about what Ford has committed here, it really is incredible, because it is bringing back an asset to the city, along with the 30 acres around it, that is going to be incredibly vibrant,\u201d she added. \u2018You had to fix the place up\u2019 The renewed Michigan Central comes at a critical time in Detroit\u2019s economic recovery, which as been more than a decade in the making, said Kevin Johnson, president and chief executive officer at the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation. The city has come a long way since July 18, 2013, when Detroit was the largest municipality in US history to file for bankruptcy after years of declining revenue, population losses, rising crime, a national financial crisis, automaker struggles and political corruption. \u201cAny city worth its own salt has a vibrant downtown that pumps the blood into the neighborhoods that it needs in order for the revitalization in the neighborhoods to start taking place,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s been a theme in Detroit since 2013. Right when the bankruptcy happened, philanthropic, corporate, neighborhood groups, outside investors began to look at Detroit as a [growth] opportunity, versus an opportunity to close it out and close it down.\u201d And it started with the basics: repairing sidewalks, turning back on streetlights, revitalizing the riverfront, coordinating trash pickup, demolishing homes that were left abandoned, razing industrial facilities that had fallen into ruin. \u201cThe fundamentals of running a city was the core of what started this revitalization,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had to fix the place up.\u201d A resurgence within the automotive industry and Detroit\u2019s \u201cBig Three\u201d helped boost those efforts, Johnson said. \u201cThe automotive industry began to recreate itself into a new and powerful job creator for Detroit,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a demand from the Big Three that we want you as close to our production base as possible, and that gave rise to those suppliers taking some of those old abandoned facilities and regenerating them.\u201d The economic data speaks volumes of that long road back: The city is adding jobs, generating revenue and, for the first time in decades, adding population. As of April, Detroit\u2019s unemployment rate was 3.8%, a tick better than the US overall rate of 3.9%, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. \u201cI look at the unemployment rate to gauge the overall health of the labor market, which I think is an indicator of how the general economy is faring,\u201d said Charles Dougherty, senior economist at Wells Fargo. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty low, and has been low over the past few years.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to say that Detroit is fully on its way to a robust period of economic growth, but there are early indications that Detroit is at the beginning stages of mounting a comeback.\u201d Residents like Butler have had a front row seat to the resurgence. \u201cWhat you look for are cranes in the skylines, and now you see them everywhere, and it\u2019s a beautiful thing because it\u2019s something positive for the city.\u201d he said. \u201cBut, ostensibly, it took for [the bankruptcy] to happen in order to get the investments and get people coming in and seeing the high upsides of the city.\u201d He added: \u201cBut now you see it everywhere, and it\u2019s nowhere more apparent than here at Michigan Central.\u201d Creating beauty from blight The resurrection of Michigan Central Station was no small feat. \u201cIt was the most infamous symbol of Detroit\u2019s decline, the international poster child of \u2018ruin [photography],\u2019\u201d Dan Austin, Michigan Central\u2019s spokesperson who has long chronicled the city\u2019s architectural history on HistoricDetroit.org. Fifteen years ago, the station was the bleak and blighted backdrop for rap artist and native son Eminen\u2019s music video for \u201cBeautiful,\u201d a song about his struggles with drug addiction. The video began with the phrase, \u201cIn 1950, Michigan was 1 of 8 states in America that collectively produced 36% of the world\u2019s GNP. Detroit was the greatest manufacturing city in the world.\u201d When Ford bought Michigan Central Station in 2018 for $90 million, Chairman Bill Ford told CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow at the time that the building\u2019s decay was \u201clike a knife through my heart.\u201d The vision was to restore the building to its prior state of grandeur, outfit the ground floor with restaurants and retail \u2014 similar to the refurbishment of Denver\u2019s Union Station \u2014 and place offices and a hotel in the stories above. The neighboring building and surrounding acreage would be complementary to the task of creating a high-tech innovation district hubbed by Ford. During the past six years, more than 3,000 skilled tradespeople spent a combined 1.7 million hours to meticulously renovate the building. That painstaking work (including 450 hours dedicated to the hand-carving of a Corinthian column framing the main entrance) involved Ford Motor Company buying and reopening an Indiana quarry that served as the source for the original limestone. \u201cThe amount of love poured into this thing, the attention to detail getting it right \u2026 I don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s ever been a restoration project of this scale,\u201d Austin said. When Michigan Central Station officially reopens this Thursday \u2014 with a sold-out concert produced by Eminem and boasting a lineup of Detroit performers including Diana Ross and Jack White, according to an announcement Monday \u2014 it will serve as the second act of Ford\u2019s billion-dollar innovation district. Last year, the neighboring Book Depository building was reopened as Newlab at Michigan Central, a tech hub for startups and early stage companies. Nearly 100 firms operate there today, including many bridging the energy, mobility and manufacturing sectors. The projects under way include developing streets that charge electric vehicles, robots that can handle last-mile deliveries and a \u201cGoogle Maps for drones.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really grown into an extraordinary and thriving ecosystem,\u201d said Josh Sirefman, CEO of Michigan Central Station. And with Michigan Central Station coming online, that\u2019s only expected to grow. \u201cThat\u2019s the poetry of those catalytic investments by Ford into physical assets that were symbols of both a past time and then of decline,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re the epicenter of this work that is positioning Detroit once again as a leader.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/economy/detroit-michigan-central-station/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}

According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_business_spicy-snack-foods-drinks-trend-swicy", "text": "Americans should prepare for a sizzling hot summer, and not just because of rising temperatures. Consumers are bravely opening their palate to bolder, spicier, more fiery flavors and the marketplace for foods and drinks is happily obliging them. Walk into a Walmart, Target, a corner 7-Eleven, pretty much any food store lately that sells packaged food and it\u2019s hard to miss. The snack aisle has gotten spicier. \u201cThe spicy trend is here to stay,\u201d Sally Lyons Wyatt, packaged goods and foodservice industry\u00a0advisor with market research firm Circana, said in an interview with CNN. From chips, popcorn, burgers to ice cream, frozen pizza, alcohol, Starbucks drinks to Coca-Cola, a growing variety of foods and beverage brands are punching up their offerings by adding the spice, bold \u201cswicy\u201d flavor or outright heat. \u201cMy whole motto for a couple of years has been, \u2018The hotter the better,\u2019 because consumers gravitate to it. Traditionally it was younger consumers that were driving this but now we\u2019ve seen bold flavors being embraced by most age groups but the dominant are still younger consumers,\u201d Lyons Wyatt said. The segment of the population firing up demand for fiery flavors, she said, includes younger Millennials, Gen Z and the youngest cohort, Gen Alpha. While it might seem as though we\u2019re surrounded by spiciness in every grocery aisle lately, the start of this trend goes back at least a decade and is well established with spicy flavors in snacking, she said. \u201cBut the proliferation of spiciness across different categories, like beverages, that part is relatively new,\u201d Lyons said. To her point, Coca-Cola in February launched its first new permanent soda flavor addition in years. The flavor it chose: Coca-Cola Spiced. The company told CNN that its own research had surfaced an \u201cincrease in consumer willingness to try a spiced beverage\u201d and \u201cmore bold flavors and more complex flavor profiles\u201d both in food and beverages. The soda giant described the new drink as a blend of the traditional Coke flavor with raspberry and spiced flavors and said it would be available in both full sugar and zero-sugar varieties. First comes spice, then comes \u201cswicy\u201d Starbucks in April came out with a new limited-time spiced up line of its lemonade drinks in three flavors \u2014 Spicy Dragonfruit, Spicy Pineapple and Spicy Strawberry, which it said are inspired by the \u201cswicy\u201d trend of creatively combining sweet and spicy flavors. Spicy plus sweet give you \u201cSwicy.\u201d And yes, brands are trying to make it a thing as they look for ways to stretch out the spicy trend. It said the refreshers, targeting Gen Z and Millennials, are punched up by adding Starbucks\u2019 spicy chili powder blend to the concoctions. Starbucks in the spring also introduced limited-time hot honey drinks, made with wildflower honey infused with chili peppers, such as Hot Honey Affogato and Hot Honey Espresso Martini to the menu at its Starbucks Reserve roasteries and stores in the US. \u201cI think we are going to see a lot more of this,\u201d said Lyons Wyatt. \u201cThere is a push now and we do see both unit and dollar growth of spicy and swicy products.\u201d Younger, diverse America is spicier According to Circana, dollar sales for food and beverages with \u201cspicy\u201d in the description\u00a0has increased 9% year-over-year. Circana\u2019s latest data also found that 11% of 25 to 34-year-olds enjoy bold and unexpected flavors, up 7 percentage points from 2019 and that 11% of 18 to 34-year-olds enjoy bold and unexpected flavors, up 4.7 percentage points from 2019. Shifting demographics is a big driver for bolder flavor experimentation, industry experts said. The United States has become more racially and ethnically diverse, and as such, sees widening access to more global ingredients and dishes, Jennifer Creevy, director of food and drink at trend forecasting and analytics firm WGSN, said in an interview with CNN. \u201cThe younger generations, Gen Z and Gen Alpha, are also much more global in their outlook than previous generations. To them a chilli crisp or a salsa macha is as much a regular condiment as say a mayo or ketchup,\u201d Creevy said. Increased globalization has also led to more culturally-diverse music, entertainment and gaming become the norm, which in turn influences our food decisions, she said. \u201cTake the rise of K-Drama and K-Pop as an example. Fans of this entertainment want to consume the media but also want to taste the flavors of Korea, hence the rise of spicy Gochujang, which is now in everything from dishes to snacks, drinks and desserts,\u201d she said. Gochujang, a red chili paste, is a popular Korean condiment. Interest is also growing for Vietnamese and African cuisine over the last four years, according to global market research firm Mintel. The pandemic, too, has been an important accelerator of the popularity of spice. \u201cDuring the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, consumers could not travel and so yearned to taste the cuisines of faraway places,\u201d Creevy said. \u201cThis, coupled with consumers becoming more confident in the kitchen has led to more adventurous tastes. Can our taste buds handle spice as we age? The longevity of spicy and swicy will depend on how committed consumers are to sticking with these flavors as they grow older. \u201cOur tastebuds change as we age. So I\u2019m hesitant to say that it is for everyone all through your life,\u201d said Lyons Wyatt. \u201cIt is being fueled by the younger generation, and enjoyed by all generations, just not at the same degree.\u201d Expect spiciness to expand to other food categories, too. \u201cMore sweet and spicy in confections, in frozen goods, in deli products and more in pizza varieties through the sauces,\u201d she said. Pepsico, which owns the spicy Flamin\u2019 Hot snack and beverage brand, told CNN that in 2023, shoppers in North America made nearly 400 million trips to stores to purchase Flamin\u2019 Hot products, up 31% from the previous year. \u201cFlamin\u2019 Hot is especially popular among younger, more adventurous consumers, who want that hit of intense experience with every bite,\u201d said Mustafa Shamseldin, category growth officer and CMO, International Foods at Pepsico. \u201cWe\u2019ve continued to cultivate the brand to satisfy the expectations of this group and consistently work to bring forward flavors that resonate \u2014 whether they\u2019re looking big flavors with a hint of spice or a full blast of heat.\u201d Nestl\u00e9 USA, which owns the DiGiorno frozen pizza brand, told CNN it\u2019s leaning into the trend with product innovations. Nestl\u00e9 in the spring launched its DiGiorno Thin & Crispy Stuffed Crust Pepperoni Pizza with Mike\u2019s Hot Honey. Nestl\u00e9 also introduced the Tombstone taverrn-style pizza called \u201cthe Primo,\u201d with\u00a0pepperoni, sausage, banana peppers and red onion. Nestl\u00e9 has also trotted out recent spicy innovations such as California Pizza Kitchen\u2019s Hot Honey Croissant Crust Pizza, Stouffer\u2019s Spicy Nacho Mac and Hot Pockets x Hot Ones. \u201cI\u2019d like to challenge the perception that the American palate was ever bland to begin with: red pepper flakes have always been a core part of the pizza experience,\u201d said Varchasvi Singh, food service analyst with Mintel. \u201cAmericans have made cult-favorites out of condiments like Sriracha and hot honey. But there certainly is an expanded appetite for spicy foods and flavors, one that is driven by wanting to explore unfamiliar ingredients and cuisines,\u201d Singh said. \u201cThis enthusiasm isn\u2019t a fad, it is here to stay.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/business/spicy-snack-foods-drinks-trend-swicy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_business_uno-card-game-popularity-cec", "text": "\u201cPlace your order.\u201d In the time it took you to read that sentence, another deck of Uno was sold. The family-favorite card game has been around for 52 years \u2014 but it may be more popular than ever. Almost everyone seems to play it, and by one measure it\u2019s the top-selling game in the world. Almost one set of Uno was sold in the US every second last year, according to Mattel, its publisher. That\u2019s almost 60 Uno decks each minute \u2014 up from 17 sets each minute in 2021. Its popularity is due to the game\u2019s broad appeal, says Michelle Parnett-Dwyer, a curator at the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York. \u201cKids can play against adults without being overmatched, and adults can play it together and still have fun,\u201d she says. \u201cThe gameplay is simple and easy to understand, and playing a round moves quickly.\u201d More than 600 editions of Uno are available, but the game\u2019s core mechanics remain mostly the same with each new version. Players draw a handful of cards and then take turns trying to discard them; the first player to get rid of all their cards wins. A player can put down a card if it matches either the color or number of the previous card at the top of the play pile. Or to switch things up, players can put down an action card \u2014 requiring the next player to draw more cards or skip a turn. Uno makes frequent cameos in popular culture. The Obama family played the game together as far back as 2007. The game has appeared in many celebrities\u2019 social media posts, from Joe Jonas to Kylie Jenner. John Legend and Chrissy Teigen once brought Uno to Vanity Fair\u2019s Oscars viewing party. And last July, Questlove threw a star-studded Uno party attended by Taylor Swift and Jason Sudeikis. The game was recently featured in an episode of the TV series \u201cHacks,\u201d when lead character Deborah Vance joins some old friends for a card game in Las Vegas, only to learn that instead of poker they\u2019re playing Uno. In 2021, Mattel announced it was creating a live-action heist comedy movie based on Uno, starring rapper Lil Yachty. The shelf life of Uno Uno was created in 1971 by Merle Robbins, a barber from Ohio. Robbins and his wife printed 5,000 copies of the game and traveled around the US selling them at campgrounds. It grew in popularity in the 1980s after the Robbinses sold the rights to the game. And then, in 1992, Mattel acquired it. Uno, it seems, is one of those games that has remained popular through multiple generations. It\u2019s often there in the background in people\u2019s homes \u2014\u00a0stacked on a shelf with other board and card games or stored in a drawer, ready for game nights and camping trips. The game is \u201crelatively inexpensive and portable,\u201d says Parnett-Dwyer. The cheapest versions go for under $6 on Amazon. This makes it easy to replace a \u201cwell-loved version (that) has one too many creases and bent edges\u201d with a new deck, she says. Uno currently holds the top spot in the traditional games category \u2014 which includes everything you would find in the games aisle at a Walmart or Target, including board games (with the exception of trading card games such as Pok\u00e9mon and Yu-Gi-Oh!)\u00a0\u2014 according to retail tracking service Circana. It has held this title for two years globally, and three in the US. The card game is now for sale in over 80 countries. Its many editions range from a braille Uno to a nonpartisan edition, where the usual red and blue cards are swapped for orange and purple to avoid associations with American politics. This year alone, Mattel has released 27 new Uno decks. These includes the launch of Uno Fandom, a category that \u201ccelebrates fandoms big and small across TV, film, sports teams and pop culture,\u201d Mattel\u2019s Vice President and Global Head of Games, Ray Adler, tells CNN. These decks, commemorating everything from Harry Potter to the NFL, include special rules and collectible foil cards. \u201cThe original Uno has staying power because of its broad appeal,\u201d says Parnett-Dwyer. \u201cBut different editions and variations have certainly helped with attracting new audiences and getting kids excited about playing their first round.\u201d How new versions of Uno factor into the game\u2019s popularity Mattel has seen over a long period of time that these new Uno versions are \u201cadditive and non-cannibalistic,\u201d says Adler, meaning the fresh editions contribute to the game\u2019s overall growth and do not hurt sales of existing products. In one of its biggest departures from the traditional playstyle of Uno, Mattel released a version called Show \u2018em No Mercy in October 2023. It quickly sold out, and Mattel continues to struggle to meet demand, Adler says. Show \u2018em No Mercy is an extreme edition of the game and comes with a slew of new rules and new cards (an additional 56 on top of the 108 in the traditional game). This includes a \u201cDraw 10\u201d card and a rule that once you reach 25 cards in your hand you\u2019re out. It also allows stacking, a move in which a player can put down multiple cards \u2014\u00a0yes, even Draw 10s. Stacking is a hot Uno topic that has led to many debates, both online and during real-life game nights, for not being an official rule. It\u2019s only addressed in the rulebooks of a few versions, such as Uno Attack Mega Hit. Show \u2018em No Mercy was, in part, inspired by consumer insight and social media feedback, says Adler. \u201cPeople love playing action cards against their friends and family \u2014 and those get some of the best reactions, especially when there are lots of action cards,\u201d Adler says. \u201cAnd so we said, \u2018What if we just took that and went to the next level?\u2019 \u2026 the design team did an incredible job of really saying, \u2018What are the brutal elements of Uno, and how do you accentuate them?\u2019\u201d Show \u2018em No Mercy has resonated with players and gone viral on social media due to its cutthroat play. (Mattel itself has leaned into the social media banter, posting a fake Draw 100 card on April Fool\u2019s Day.) In the first quarter of 2024, it was the second-most popular game in Circana\u2019s traditional games category, right behind traditional Uno. By the end of 2024, Mattel will release \u201cwell over\u201d 50 new editions of Uno, Adler says. Most of these will be variants, with only two or three each year having significant changes to gameplay. Parnett-Dwyer says the game was inducted into her museum\u2019s National Toy Hall of Fame in 2018. \u201cGreat toys and games get passed on from generation to generation. Many of today\u2019s grandparents played Uno with their kids, and then those next parents play it now with their kids,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a \u2018classic.\u2019\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/business/uno-card-game-popularity-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}

In an update, NYSE said impacted stocks have reopened and \u201call systems are currently operational.\u201d Intercontinental Exchange, the parent company of NYSE, has found no indication the glitch was caused by a cyberattack, a senior executive at a major bank in touch with ICE told CNN. Instead, an NYSE spokesperson said there was a \u201ctechnical issue\u201d with industry-wide price bands that \u201ctriggered\u201d trading halts on up to 40 symbols listed on NYSE Group exchanges. NYSE noted that those price bands are published by the Consolidated Tape Association\u2019s (CTA) Security Information Processor (SIP). CTA, an industry group, is responsible for publishing real-time trade and quote data. CTA said it\u00a0experienced an issue\u00a0that \u201cmay have been related to a new software release.\u201d\u00a0To fix the issue, the\u00a0industry group said it relied on a secondary data center operating on the older version of the software. Dozens of stocks were paused earlier in the day, an indication they traded outside those so-called limit up-limit down bands, according to\u00a0NYSE\u2019s website. That list includes Chipotle and Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company run by legendary investor Warren Buffett. For nearly two hours, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Class A shares were listed as trading at just $185.10 \u2014 a price that would represent a loss of 99.97%. Berkshire closed at $627,400 on Friday.

Joe Saluzzi, co-founder of Themis Trading, told CNN that the NYSE\u2019s explanation is hard to square with the bizarre trades that hit the tape. \u201cI\u2019m not buying that explanation. That doesn\u2019t make any sense to me,\u201d said Saluzzi, a market structure expert and author of \u201cBroken Markets.\u201d Trading data provided by Refinitiv shows that Berkshire Hathaway changed hands at $620,700 as of 9:44:32 on Monday morning.

{"id": "2024_05_04_economy_what-exactly-goes-into-closing-costs", "text": "Elevated interest rates and pricier listings have made it even harder to afford a new home. But there is an often-overlooked expense when buying a home: closing costs. These costs, which are the fees owed on the day you finalize the purchase of a home, have risen in recent years. In 2022, the median cost of a loan paid by homebuyers \u2014 including origination fees, appraisal and credit report fees, title insurance, discount points and other fees \u2014 was $6,000, a nearly 22% increase from 2021, according to a report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But the calculation for closing costs could soon change. The Biden administration plans to take aim at so-called \u201cjunk fees\u201d hidden in closing costs: In a recent report, the CFPB said it would work to \u201canalyze mortgage closing costs, seek public input and, as necessary, issue rules and guidance to improve competition, choice, and affordability.\u201d And this month it launched a public inquiry into the issue. Additionally, a recent settlement by the National Association of Realtors set to take effect in August could potentially increase these costs for some homebuyers. Here\u2019s what to know about closing costs: What are you paying for? Not every buyer pays the same amount in closing costs. The final bill depends on several factors, including which state you live in, taxes, the type of mortgage loan you take out and the overall cost of the home you are buying. Closing costs can include an application fee to process your loan request, home appraisal fees that determine how much the property is worth, a credit reporting fee, title insurance (which protects the buyer from defective property titles) and an origination fee (the price you pay for getting the loan in the first place). Some states require an attorney at closing, which adds to the overall bill. Some lenders roll closing costs into the total mortgage, increasing payments over time. New York, Delaware and Washington, DC, have the highest average closing costs, according to Bankrate; while Missouri, Indiana and North Dakota have the lowest. \u201cThey typically can be 3% to 4% of the amount of the loan,\u201d Jeff Ostrowski, \ufeffwho covers housing at Bankrate, said of closing costs nationwide. \u201cSo if you\u2019re borrowing $400,000, you\u2019re talking about an extra $12,000 to $15,000.\u201d Ostrowski said that while existing homebuyers already know the drill when it comes to closing costs, some first-time homebuyers may forget to factor them in when saving for a home. \u201cFor first-time buyers who are really stretching to qualify, it can be something to worry about,\u201d Ostrowski said. \u201cGenerally, the loan officer you\u2019re working with knows that and they\u2019re going to factor that in to your approval process.\u201d Realtor settlement could add to homebuyers\u2019 costs Historically, homebuyers haven\u2019t had to pay their realtors\u2019 fees themselves. However, last month, a federal judge gave the green light to the NAR settlement, paving the way for potential changes to the current real estate business model. Under the terms of the settlement, sellers\u2019 agents will no longer be required to offer commissions to buyers\u2019 agents. This means homebuyers may have to pay their Realtor\u2019s commission themselves, adding to the overall cost at closing. Brian Connolly, an assistant professor of business law at the University of Michigan, said it\u2019s too soon to predict how the NAR settlement may affect closing costs. \u201cIt\u2019s not really all that clear what\u2019s going to happen with broker commissions after the NAR settlement goes into effect this summer,\u201d Connolly said, predicting the status quo may remain even after the settlement takes effect. \u201cAt least initially, we\u2019re likely to see the percentage commission system continue.\u201d No more junk fees? As part of the broader Biden administration effort to crack down on junk fees, the CFPB said it was looking into ways to reduce costs for homebuyers. Closing costs are \u201ctoo often full of junk fees,\u201d the bureau said. Fees for credit reports were one example given by the CFPB. Homebuyers pay a fee for mortgage lenders to pull their credit reports from the three major credit reporting companies: Equifax, TransUnion and Experian. Those costs have recently spiked by 25% or as much as 400%, according to the CFPB. (Consumers can check their credit scores for free every 12 months at AnnualCreditReport.com). \u201cThese steep increases in a market that lacks competition and choice warrant further scrutiny,\u201d the report said. While it\u2019s a good start, tackling junk fees doesn\u2019t get to the heart of the home affordability crisis, Connolly said. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re heavily under-supplied on housing, we\u2019re dealing with labor shortages in home construction and we\u2019re dealing with continued high prices for raw materials \u2014 these are the bigger structure issues in the market and it seems like this is just working around the edges for a much bigger issue,\u201d he said. Lowering closing costs on your own There is one relatively simple way to lower your overall closing costs: shop around. According to Freddie Mac, a significant percentage of people don\u2019t compare rates from multiple lenders, though it could save homebuyers thousands of dollars. For example, in late 2022, borrowers could save as much as $600 annually by getting one additional rate quote and an average of more than $1,200 annually by getting at least four rate quotes, according to data compiled by Freddie Mac. \u201cBorrowers who received as many as five rate quotes during the second half of 2022 could have potentially saved more than $6,000 over the life of the loan, assuming the loan remains active for at least five years,\u201d Genaro Villa, an economist at Freddie Mac, said in a statement. And even if more than one lender pulls your credit score, it won\u2019t hurt your credit, as long as it\u2019s done within a 45-day window, according to the CFPB. \u201cYou should get at least three mortgage offers,\u201d Ostrowski said. \u201cWhen you compare those offers, examine not just the rate itself but also the closing costs. There can be some variation, and if it\u2019s significant, you obviously would want to choose the lender that gives you the best deal.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments and context.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/04/economy/what-exactly-goes-into-closing-costs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_business_opec-oil-production-cuts-2025", "text": "The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies \u2014\u202fa group of leading oil producers known as OPEC+ \u2014 agreed Sunday to extend production cuts announced last year into 2025. The group said in a statement it would extend a cut of 1.65 million barrels per day, announced in April 2023, until the end of 2025. That cut was due to expire at the end of this year. It is also extending a cut of 2.2 million barrels per day, announced in November, until the end of September this year, before it is \u201cgradually phased out on a monthly basis\u201d by the end of September 2025. That cut was due to expire at the end of this month, and came on top of previously agreed reductions of 3.66 million barrels per day announced in 2022 and 2023 as the group \u2014 led by Saudi Arabia and Russia \u2014 tried to counter slowing demand and rising output from the United States. The group also released its 2025 production requirements for member and nonmember countries, which were essentially the same as this year\u2019s. The United Arab Emirates\u2019 production quota increased by 300,000 barrels per day. The uptick \u201cwill be phased in gradually\u201d from January through September 2025, the group said. Sunday\u2019s decisions mean the OPEC+ group will continue to restrict supply for at least the next 18 months but gradually start drip-feeding some extra barrels back into the market later this year. Prices subdued Despite the OPEC+ cuts, in total equivalent to about 5.7% of global crude supply, and ongoing tensions in the Middle East, global oil prices have fallen by about 11% since hitting a five-month high in early April. The price of Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, ticked up 0.1% to trade at $81 a barrel by 4.30 a.m. ET on Monday. It traded at $91 in early April when a suspected Israeli airstrike on Iran\u2019s embassy in Syria sent jitters through oil markets. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, also rose 0.1% by the same time on Monday morning to trade at $77 a barrel. It is down from nearly $87 per barrel in early April. Saudi Arabia needs Brent crude to trade at around $81 a barrel in order to balance its budget, according to the International Monetary Fund. Subdued prices have partly been the result of record US oil output, which has bumped up global supply, and concerns about sluggish demand in China \u2014\u202fthe world\u2019s biggest importer of oil \u2014\u202fand other major economies. In its most recent monthly report, the International Energy Agency cut its forecast for the growth in global oil demand this year by 140,000 barrels per day to 1.1 million barrels per day, citing weak demand in developed economies, particularly in Europe. Despite the weaker growth forecast, a supply crunch could develop. The IEA expects global supply to increase by just 580,000 barrels per day this year. In March, the Paris-based agency said it expected there to be a deficit in supply in 2024 if OPEC+ extended its output cuts through the rest of the year. Sunday\u2019s OPEC+ decision coincides with Saudi Arabia selling some more shares in its oil company Aramco. The government is selling less than 1% of the Riyadh-listed company in a deal that could raise $13 billion for economic diversification projects.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/business/opec-oil-production-cuts-2025/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_economy_electric-bill-increase-air-conditioning-summer", "text": "Many Americans may get hot under the collar when they open their electric bills this summer, but for some, the consequences of rising utility costs can be a lot more serious. The cost of keeping cool is expected to rise nearly 8% to an average of $719 from June through September, according to an analysis by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association and the Center for Energy Poverty and Climate. That\u2019s yet another price hike for inflation-weary consumers, who were paying only an average of $527 for electricity over the summer in 2019. The increase is projected to be even higher in some parts of the US. Those living in the mid-Atlantic and Pacific are expected to see their bills spike more than 12%, while residents in parts of the Midwest could have to contend with jumps of roughly 10%. Although electricity prices have fallen slightly, usage is expected to climb along with the thermometer, which will result in bigger bills, said Mark Wolfe, the association\u2019s executive director. He pointed to the National Weather Service\u2019s prediction that much of the country will probably have above-normal temperatures this summer. \u201cYou\u2019ll need more electricity to get through the summer,\u201d he said. The association\u2019s cost estimate is higher than that of the US Energy Information Administration, which last month predicted that the average residential electric bill will be $519 for all of June, July and August, up 2.9% from the same period a year earlier. The agency also predicts larger spikes for the mid-Atlantic, Pacific and parts of the Midwest, though not as high as the association\u2019s estimate. The difference in projections stems from the association assuming higher rates of usage because of hotter temperatures, Wolfe said. Also, the association\u2019s estimate of the total bill is larger because it includes the month of September in its summer forecast. Serious consequences For some Americans, soaring utility bills can lead to death or major health consequences. Heat-related deaths are also on the rise, with just over 2,300 people succumbing last year, up from just over 1,600 in 2021, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Also, heat-related health emergencies hit record levels in certain parts of the country last summer, which was the hottest ever recorded in the US. But the US doesn\u2019t have a comprehensive policy to help people stay cool as climate change fuels heat waves that are more intense, last longer and occur more frequently, Wolfe said. Currently, about 80% of the federal funding to help people pay for their utilities is used for heating assistance. And while some states and localities provide air conditioners to low-income households, many folks are afraid to use them because of the cost, said Diana Hernandez, an associate professor and co-director of the Energy Opportunity Lab at Columbia University. At a recent focus group in Chicago, Hernandez met a mother who rides the public buses with her children during hot summer days since she can\u2019t afford to run her air conditioner regularly. \u201cThere\u2019s a need to rethink and modernize energy assistance programs to reflect current climate realities, which have a lot to do with warming temperatures and increasing needs to stay cool at home for health, safety and survivability,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cThis is real, but our policies don\u2019t reflect the reality.\u201d Less assistance available Though many Americans are struggling to pay their utilities, federal assistance for these bills was slashed by one-third this fiscal year. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, has $4.1 billion to help consumers with heating and cooling costs, down from $6.1 billion in the prior fiscal year. States, which distribute the funds to eligible residents, have told the energy assistance directors association that the cut will force them to reduce the number of households served, by about 1 million. And those that receive help may have a smaller portion of their arrears paid off or may not have their cooling bills covered. Congress had been providing billions of dollars in additional support for LIHEAP in recent years in the wake of soaring energy prices during the Covid-19 pandemic. But that still wasn\u2019t enough to meet the need. The number of people behind in their utility bills and the amount of money they owe are at record highs, according to the association, which began tracking these figures when arrearages exploded in 2020 at the start of the pandemic. Some 21.2 million households in the US \u2014 or more than 1 in 6 \u2014 owed money on their electricity bills in December, up from 20.1 million a year earlier. Electricity and natural gas arrearages combined hit $20.3 billion, up from $17.8 billion the year before. And nearly 1 in 5 households said they kept their homes at a temperature that felt unsafe or unhealthy at least one month in the past year, according to an April Household Pulse Survey conducted by the US Census Bureau. What\u2019s more, only 17 states and the District of Columbia provide protections from power shutoffs during summer heat waves, though most states have moratoriums during cold winters. But even in the states with summertime bans, the rules are outdated and inadequate, consumer advocates say. Some only kick in during very high temperatures, while others are triggered by National Weather Service heat advisories or warnings \u2014 even though people can overheat even when the thermometer doesn\u2019t climb that high. \u201cBecause of the lack of a coherent policy to address summer cooling, people will die this summer from heatstroke,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cWe will have unnecessary deaths.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/economy/electric-bill-increase-air-conditioning-summer/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_business_zero-down-mortgage-nightcap", "text": "America\u2019s gummed-up housing market is a $45 trillion mess \u2014 a big old knot of economic forces smashing into a century\u2019s worth of cultural conditioning about the value of homeownership. There are some obvious, urgent needs: We need more housing, full stop. And that housing needs to be affordable. And we should probably stop letting Wall Street firms become landlords for the sole purpose of extracting capital from renters who could otherwise build equity. Point is, policymakers aren\u2019t running out of puzzles to solve when it comes to housing. Perhaps the last thing the market needs is another shady financial product that pushes low-income Americans into homes they can\u2019t afford, under terms that could bankrupt them. And yet, here we are. The zero-down mortgage is making a comeback, my colleague Matt Egan reports. Two weeks ago, one of the nation\u2019s largest mortgage lenders rolled out a \u201cnew\u201d program (I put new in quotation marks because, well, we\u2019ve seen this movie before) that allow first-time homebuyers to secure their purchase with no money down. Zero down. Lots on the line Let\u2019s briefly get into how it works, and then we can talk about why it\u2019s a huge red flag for anyone with passing understanding of the 2008 financial crisis. So, you want to buy a home but you\u2019re not sitting on enough savings for a downpayment. (Super common, totally fine, we\u2019ve all been there.) Under the deal being peddled by United Wholesale Mortgage, you can bypass that initial cash payment. (Sounds great, right? Read on.) Instead, you borrow 3% of the home\u2019s value (up to $15,000) as an interest-free loan, and pay for 97% of the home\u2019s value with a standard mortgage. (Interest-free! Where do I sign up?) Here\u2019s the catch: That $15,000 won\u2019t accrue interest, but it will need to be paid back \u2014 in full, all at once \u2014 when you either sell the home, pay off the mortgage or refinance. That will work out great, assuming nothing bad happens to you or the economy and the value of your home keeps going up. And honestly, when has the value of the housing market ever gone anywhere but up up up up? Ohhhh right.  So let\u2019s just highlight some of the ways this $15,000 sword of Damocles could wind up stabbing you in the back. UWM is pushing back on all those concerns, noting that borrowers must still go through strict underwriting guidelines, and lending standards have gone up significantly since the financial crisis. \u201cPeople who make these claims are uneducated about the current state of the industry,\u201d Alex Elezaj, UWM\u2019s chief strategy officer, told CNN. \u201cIn today\u2019s environment, UWM is responsible for underwriting the loan, which gives us confidence that these are high quality loans.\u201d And sure, we\u2019re not exactly doling out NINJA loans \u2014 no income, no job or assets \u2014 anymore. But if there\u2019s a morsel of wisdom mortgage companies should have tattooed on their foreheads it\u2019s that lower-income people with no savings are likely to suffer more in a bad economy. \u201cOne of the lessons of the subprime crisis,\u201d said Jonathan Adams, an assistant professor at Saint Joseph\u2019s University, \u201cwas that you are\u00a0not\u00a0doing any favors to borrowers by making it too easy to borrow.\u201d Creative homebuying The resurgence of the zero-down loan underscores how sticky the housing market of 2024 has become. With low inventory and mortgage rates around 7%, sellers are unmotivated to move, and buyers lack choice, forcing some to get creative. One way for motivated buyers to hunt for a lower mortgage rate is buy someone else\u2019s. \u201cAssumable\u201d mortgages are loans that allow a homebuyer to take over a seller\u2019s existing loan \u2014 its (ideally) lower interest rate, my colleague Samantha Delouya reports. The way it works: A buyer pays out in cash the amount that the seller has in equity, while taking on the remaining mortgage balance. It\u2019s not a perfect solution for everyone, of course \u2014 that equity could be a hefty amount that the buyer may not have on hand, and only about a quarter of all mortgages is the US are assumable. But it beats waiting on the magic combination of macroeconomic forces to finally bring rates on new mortgages down. It worked for Ellen Harper, a software analyst in her mid-50s, who closed on a Fairburn, Georgia, home in April, when the average 30-year rate was just over 7%. Harper\u2019s rate? 2.49%. That\u2019s saving her thousands of dollars in monthly payments, Samantha writes. \u201cI just decided I wanted to see how low I could pay on the interest rate,\u201d Harper says. \u201cI went into it looking for the best deal I could get, and I think I did pretty good.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/business/zero-down-mortgage-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}

Two years ago, Taco Bell and Cheez-It created two new menu items that used a massive cheese cracker \u2014 16-times bigger than normal \u2014 for a test sold at only one restaurant, sparking a frenzy among its fans. Beginning June 6, the collaboration is going nationwide for a limited time. The \u201cBig Cheez-It Tostada\u201d and \u201cBig Cheez-It Crunchwrap Supreme\u201d are being added to US menus following a trial run that got \u201coverwhelmingly positive reaction\u201d and proved that the it Cheez-It menu items \u201cbrought something new to the table,\u201d Taco Bell said in a press release Thursday. These kinds of collaboration often bring publicity to both brands, allowing them to expand their reach. And the Taco Bell and Cheez-It collaboration comes as consumer brands across the country, from retailers to restaurants and more, find inflation-weary consumers are pulling back on spending. The \u201cBig Cheez-It Tostada\u201d layers ground beef, reduced-fat sour cream, tomatoes, lettuce and cheddar cheese on the cheesy cracker for $3.99. The \u201cBig Cheez-It Crunchwrap Supreme\u201d replaces the internal tostada shell with a giant Cheez-It for $5.49, with mostly the same ingredients, except nacho cheese sauce in place of shredded cheese. Both items received slight prices increases from their 2022 test, but a new offer as a part of this release is a \u201cBig Cheez-It Box\u201d deal, which includes the \u201cBig Cheez-It Crunchwrap Supreme,\u201d a five-layer beef burrito, nacho fries and a medium drink for $8.99. Like other fast food chains, Taco Bell\u2019s parent, Yum Brands, isn\u2019t resistant to a slowdown in consumer spending, especially among lower-income diners. In the company\u2019s most recent earnings report, released in early May, revenue missed analysts\u2019 expectations as Pizza Hut and KFC same-store sales dropped. Taco Bell, which makes up a vast majority of Yum\u2019s US profits, was the lone bright spot: Same-store sales grew 2% for the first quarter. Shares of Yum Brands (YUM) have risen nearly 5% for the year. Earlier this year, Taco Bell unveiled its full slate of menu items rolling out in 2024, which also includes other foods have fans been craving (but the chain hasn\u2019t yet revealed release dates). On tap in the coming months include a Mountain Dew Baja Blast gelato and collaborations with other brands, like Tajin and Cinnabon, which are part of broader growth plans for the brand.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/food/taco-bell-cheez-it-release/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_business_dr-pepper-pepsi", "text": "Coke is still the top soda in America. But the runner up spot, long held by Pepsi, now belongs to Dr Pepper. After years of slowly gaining market share, Dr Pepper inched ahead of Pepsi as the number two soda brand in the country in 2023, according to market share data from Beverage Digest, a trade publication. Coke is the leader by a comfortable margin. Last year, it captured 19.2% of the soda market in the United States by volume, Beverage Digest\u2019s data shows. Dr Pepper and Pepsi both had 8.3%, with Dr Pepper technically ahead. After that came other brands owned by Coca-Cola: Sprite came in at 8.1% and Diet Coke at 7.8%. While \u201cDr Pepper has been gaining, [Pepsi] has been declining, and they\u2019re meeting in the middle,\u201d said Duane Stanford, editor of Beverage Digest, in an interview with CNN. Over the years, the peppery soda \u2014 with its claimed blend of 23 flavors \u2014 has been growing in popularity, leaning into its identity as a spicy alternative to cola and taking advantage of broader trends. Founded in 1885 in Waco, Texas, Dr Pepper preceded both Coca-Cola and Pepsi. And while the two cola giants battled it out in the 20th century, Dr Pepper established a small but devoted following in the American South. For years a regional favorite, Dr Pepper in the 1970s marketed itself to a national audience as a unique flavor. Over the years, it has gained traction with a national audience. Today, Dr Pepper is experimenting with new flavors. The brand introduced Dr Pepper Strawberries & Cream last year. The addition was \u201ca standout success,\u201d Timothy Cofer, CEO of Dr Pepper parent company Keurig Dr Pepper, said during an analyst call in April. The brand has also rolled out trendy limited-time flavors, like Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut, inspired by TikTok\u2019s dirty soda trend (mixing soda with milk or cream and other flavors). But the brand doesn\u2019t have to do too much to be on trend. \u201cSwicy,\u201d or sweet and spicy, items are taking over the food and beverage aisle. Even Coca-Cola wants in: The company in February introduced Coca-Cola Spiced, a rare permanent addition to the lineup of Coke flavors. Pepsi, on the other hand, may have been too focused on its other brands. Unlike Coca-Cola and Keurig Dr Pepper, Pepsico has a massive food business \u2014 its sprawling portfolio includes Quaker, Frito-Lay and more. And when it comes to beverages, Stanford noted, it seems to be focused on its zero sugar lines rather than classic Pepsi. \u201cThey\u2019re leading with that now,\u201d Stanford said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/business/dr-pepper-pepsi/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}

Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia (NVDA), said Sunday that the company would roll out its most advanced AI chip platform, called Rubin, in 2026. The Rubin platform will succeed the Blackwell, which supplies chips for data centers and was announced only in March. It was dubbed by Nvidia at the time as the \u201cworld\u2019s most powerful chip.\u201d The Rubin will feature new graphics processing units (GPUs), a new central processing unit (CPU) called Vera and advanced networking chips, Huang said in an address at National Taiwan University in Taipei. \u201cToday, we\u2019re at the cusp of a major shift in computing,\u201d Huang told the audience ahead of the opening of Computex, a tech trade show organized annually in Taiwan. \u201cThe intersection of AI and accelerated computing is set to redefine the future.\u201d He revealed a roadmap for new semiconductors that will arrive on a \u201cone-year rhythm.\u201d Investors have been driving up shares in chip firms riding the generative AI boom. Shares of Nvidia, the market leader, have more than doubled over the past year. \u201cNvidia clearly intends to keep its dominance for as long as possible and in the current generation, there is nothing really on the horizon to challenge that,\u201d said Richard Windsor, founder of Radio Free Mobile, a research company focusing on the digital and mobile ecosystem. Nvidia accounts for around 70% of AI semiconductor sales. But competition is growing, with major competitors AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) introducing new products in an effort to challenge Nvidia\u2019s dominance. On Monday, AMD CEO Lisa Su unveiled the company\u2019s latest AI processors in Taipei and a plan to develop new products over the next two years. Its next generation MI325X accelerator will be made available in the fourth quarter of this year, she said. Number one priority The global competition to create generative AI applications has led to soaring demand for the cutting edge chips used in data centers to support these programs. Both Nvidia and AMD, which are run by CEOs who are part of the same Taiwanese family, were once best known by gamers for selling GPUs that display visuals in video games, helping them come to life. While the two still compete in that space, their GPUs are now also\u00a0being used\u00a0to power generative AI, the technology that underpins newly popular systems such as ChatGPT. \u201cAI is our number one priority, and we\u2019re at the beginning of an incredibly exciting time for the industry,\u201d Su added. \u201cWe launched MI300X last year with leadership inference performance, memory size and compute capabilities, and we have now expanded our roadmap so it\u2019s now on an annual cadence, that means a new product family every year,\u201d she said. The new chip will succeed the MI300 and feature more memory, faster memory bandwidth and better computer performance, Su added. The company will launch a new product family every year, with the MI350 set for 2025 and MI400 a year later. Intel is also expected to launch its next-generation desktop CPUs, Arrow Lake, in the fourth quarter of this year.

{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_03_tech_tiktok-live-child-safety-utah-lawsuit", "text": "A new Utah lawsuit accuses TikTok of enabling the sexual exploitation of children through its livestreaming feature. TikTok live allows users to post live videos to the platform, where they can interact with viewers and respond to comments in real time. TikTok also allows viewers to send monetary \u201cgifts\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0often represented by colorful emojis \u2014 to users conducting livestreams. TikTok does not allow users under the age of 18 to host livestreams. But the lawsuit, filed by Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes in state court in Utah, alleges that TikTok Live operates \u201clike a virtual strip club\u201d where children may be encouraged by adults to engage in \u201cillicit acts\u201d on camera in exchange for payments from other users. It also claims that TikTok has insufficient age verification and enforcement measures to ensure the app is being used safely. TikTok has known since before December 2023 that there are \u201cpervasive issues with transactional sexual content occurring during LIVE sessions, especially involving kids, through user complaints and internal safety reports,\u201d the complaint, filed Monday in Utah district court, states. TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement that the platform has \u201cindustry-leading policies and measures to help protect the safety and well-being of teens. Creators must be at least 18 years old before they can go LIVE, and their account must meet a follower requirement. We immediately revoke access to features if we find accounts that do not meet our age requirements.\u201d The Monday lawsuit is the second filed by Utah\u2019s attorney general against TikTok for allegedly putting children at risk. In a separate lawsuit last year, Utah accused the app of harming the mental health of young users, mirroring similar claims from Arkansas and New York City against TikTok and other social media platforms. TikTok has repeatedly pushed back on claims that it is harmful to children\u2019s wellbeing, saying it supports young users with various tools such as automatic time limits. It also comes as TikTok faces a potentially existential threat in the United States after President Joe Biden signed a law that requires the Chinese-owned app to be sold to a new company or be banned from US app stores. TikTok has sued to block the law, claiming it violates the First Amendment. The new Utah lawsuit, which is heavily redacted, claims TikTok has been aware of the misuse of its live feature but has failed to take adequate steps to address the issue. \u201cIn September 2022 \u2026 an investigator found that \u2018within minutes of browsing the [LIVE] feed\u2019 they were shown underage girls providing sexually suggestive content in exchange for money and young boys using filters to pose as girls to receive Gifts,\u201d the complaint states.

The monthly cost of Duo, a plan that lets two people split a premium plan, is rising by $2, to $16.99. The family plan is increasing prices by $3 to $19.99 per month. Spotify recently increased subscription prices for international subscribers, cut costs and underwent several rounds of layoffs including drastic reductions to its podcast business.

{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}

Clearinghouses, which sit between buyers and sellers, collect margins from traders as evidence that they can afford to make the transaction. \u201cAssuming everything goes well and we don\u2019t see any hiccups, the move towards T+1 will be an overall benefit to our ecosystem, institutional investors and retail [investors],\u201d said Rich Lee, head of program trading and execution strategy at Baird. Baird has had a T+1 committee in place since last summer to ensure such hiccups don\u2019t happen, Lee said. Employees have been in discussions with clients about how to assist them through the process. The company has also staffed up to handle their part in clearing trades with a shorter time frame. The shortened settlement cycle is partly in response to the 2021 meme stock frenzy, when investors on Reddit sent shares of GameStop and AMC Entertainment soaring to eye-popping heights in a short span of time. (Meme stocks typically trade less on fundamentals and more on social media frenzy.)  Robinhood and other brokerages in 2021 temporarily suspended buying of GameStop, AMC and other stocks on its platform, blaming in part the T+2 rule that pushed up collateral requirements imposed on brokers like Robinhood. Investors were left waiting for their trades and brokers with their cash locked up until the settlement, unable to allow more purchasing to ensure they had enough funds to cover the trades. \u201cThe existing two-day period to settle trades exposes investors and the industry to unnecessary risk and is ripe for change,\u201d Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said in a February 2021 release. \u201cThere is no reason why the greatest financial system the world has ever seen cannot settle trades in real time.\u201d Boeing on track to meet FAA deadline to present quality control fixes Boeing will present its plan to fix quality problems with its assembly line to US regulators next week, the company said Thursday. The plan was ordered up by the Federal Aviation Administration in late February after a hole blew open in the side of an airborne 737 Max a month earlier, reports my colleague Gregory Wallace. The FAA said it audited the production line at Boeing and its key 737 Max supplier and found \u201cmultiple instances where the companies allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements.\u201d It gave Boeing 90 days to present a plan \u2014 and that deadline is next week. Boeing chief financial officer Brian West said Thursday that Boeing and the FAA have had \u201clots of dialogue\u201d including two check-ins during the preparation of the plan. \u201cThe engagement is constructive,\u201d he said at a conference organized by Wolfe Research on Thursday. \u201cI expect next week we\u2019re going to get some good feedback.\u201d FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said separately on Thursday that the plan is \u201cnot the end of the process, it\u2019s the beginning.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long road to get back to where they need to be making safe airplanes,\u201d Whitaker said in an interview on ABC News.

Meta created an AI advisory council that\u2019s composed entirely of White men Meta this week appointed a group of outside advisors to provide guidance on its artificial intelligence strategy. The four-person advisory group is composed entirely of White men, reports my colleague Clare Duffy. The tech giant said the group, which includes tech entrepreneurs and investors, will periodically consult with Meta\u2019s management \u201con strategic opportunities related to our technology and product roadmap.\u201d The move comes as Meta plans to invest tens of billions of dollars this year in AI infrastructure, research and product development. The council includes Patrick Collison, the co-founder and chief executive of financial technology company Stripe; Nat Friedman, the tech investor and former CEO of GitHub; Tobi L\u00fctke, the founder and CEO of online shopping firm Shopify; and Charlie Songhurst, the tech investor who formerly led corporate strategy and drove several key acquisitions at Microsoft. A Meta spokesperson confirmed the group will not be paid. Despite the group\u2019s significant combined experience, Meta is already taking heat for failing to include women or people of color \u2014 or anyone else outside of the wealthy, White, male, Silicon Valley mold \u2014 in a group advising one of the world\u2019s most powerful tech companies on a revolutionary new technology. The members of the group are also all in their 30s or 40s. The situation mirrors an incident last year at OpenAI when, in the wake of a leadership shakeup, it came under fire for appointing a board composed entirely of White men. Months later, OpenAI added three women directors to the board.

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. After years of above-target inflation, geopolitical chaos and recession in Europe, the US economy remains resilient. The reason for that is mostly the American consumer, with spending accounting for about 70% of gross domestic product. But recent data shows that Americans are spending less money than they used to. That\u2019s a scary prospect for economists. On Thursday, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said that his customers are slowing down the rate of their purchases. Consumer payments, as measured through credit cards, checks and ATM withdrawals, have grown by 3.5% since last year, he said. That\u2019s down from 10% growth the year before. \u201cBoth of our customer bases that have a lot to do with how the American economy runs are saying, \u2018You know what? I\u2019m being careful, slowing things down,\u2019\u201d Moynihan said, referring to both consumers and businesses, at a financial conference in New York. A recent survey by accounting firm KPMG found a similar pattern. While people are still mostly optimistic about their own financial situations, they worry about the direction of the US economy, they found. Additionally, 65% of those surveyed, including nearly 60% of those making $200,000 or more, said that they expect to do more discount shopping this year, while 14% plan to use buy now, pay later services. Before the Bell spoke with Peter Torrente, a banking and capital markets leader in KPMG\u2019s audit practice, about what that means for the second half of the year and beyond. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Before the Bell:\u00a0Your 2024 CEO survey showed that business leaders are optimistic about the economy but not so much about their own company\u2019s prospects. This survey shows that consumers feel just the opposite \u2014 optimistic about their own financial standing but not about the macroeconomic environment. How do you explain that discrepancy?\u00a0 Peter Torrente: It\u2019s clear that Americans are viewing the growth prospects of the economy through an inflation lens, and that impact is experienced in their everyday lives. So despite the tailwinds of the strong labor market and low unemployment, the erosion of purchasing power is making it harder to be certain about what\u2019s ahead in the coming year. That\u2019s coloring consumers\u2019 outlook. While we see in the survey that consumers are more optimistic about their own financial situation, they\u2019re less optimistic about the overall prospects for growth in the US economy in the coming year compared to business leaders in our CEO survey. You see that come through in some of the statistics around shopping patterns and habits. Regardless of income level, consumers are seeking to do more discounted shopping over the year ahead despite the strong labor market and household balance sheets. People are changing their shopping habits regardless of income level. They\u2019re looking to make their paycheck go further. We\u2019ve written about how bifurcation is the word of the summer. Do you see any stratification among consumers?\u00a0 Yeah, about 65% of those surveyed said that they\u2019re planning to do more discounted shopping. And 14% are planning to use buy now, pay later services. This data actually indicates that things aren\u2019t totally bifurcated among income levels \u2014 everyone is changing their habits. Something that surprised me in this survey is that 75% of respondents don\u2019t believe that interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve will improve their personal financial situation. There\u2019s so much focus on the Fed among investors, but consumers don\u2019t seem to be as interested\u2026 There have been lots of predictions about interest rates over the last few years, and the goalposts keep changing and outlets keep changing on those. I\u2019m not sure how much consumers can anchor to when a rate cut is coming or if there will even be a rate cut. So people are just less focused on that, they don\u2019t think it will be helpful in the short term. Advisory firms urge Tesla shareholders to reject Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018excessive\u2019 pay package Two influential advisory firms have urged shareholders to vote against Elon Musk\u2019s contentious $51 billion pay package and raised concerns about the CEO\u2019s numerous side projects, reports my colleague Allison Morrow. On Friday, Institutional Shareholder Services called the package \u201cexcessive\u201d and noted that shareholder concerns \u201chave not been sufficiently mitigated\u201d since the package was first approved in 2018. While recognizing Tesla\u2019s growth and profitability, ISS said Musk\u2019s pay package \u2014 first approved in 2018 and\u00a0thrown out by a judge\u00a0in January \u2014 \u201cwas considered outsized from the start\u201d and has \u201cfailed to accomplish certain of the board\u2019s stated objectives,\u201d including focusing Musk \u201cmore closely on the Tesla organization, as opposed to his other businesses.\u201d That warning came a few days after Glass Lewis, another prominent advisory firm, published a 71-page report that criticized the size of the compensation plan and warned about Musk\u2019s \u201cslate of extraordinarily time-consuming projects\u201d that are unrelated to Tesla, such as X, the company formerly known as Twitter. Musk pushed back against the Glass Lewis report on Wednesday, telling shareholders in a\u00a0letter\u00a0that the firm \u201comits key considerations, uses faulty logic, and relies on speculation and hypotheticals.\u201d The letter urges shareholders to approve the pay package as well as the board\u2019s proposal to formally move Tesla\u2019s headquarters to Texas from Delaware. The move to Texas, where Musk also operates SpaceX, was proposed shortly after a Delaware Chancery Court judge sided with Tesla shareholders who challenged the legality of the 2018 pay package. Costco\u2019s $1.50 hot dog price is \u2018safe\u2019 Costco\u2019s new chief financial officer has a reassuring message for inflation-weary customers: Don\u2019t worry about the price of the\u00a0$1.50 hot dog-soda\u00a0combo. \u201cTo\u00a0clear\u00a0up\u00a0some\u00a0recent\u00a0media\u00a0speculation,\u00a0I\u00a0also\u00a0want\u00a0to\u00a0confirm\u00a0the\u00a0$1.50\u00a0hot\u00a0dog\u00a0price is\u00a0safe,\u201d Costco CFO Gary Millerchip said on an earnings call with analysts Thursday. It was Millerchip\u2019s first earnings call with analysts since taking over for Richard Galanti, Costco\u2019s colorful finance chief of nearly four decades and the\u00a0longest-serving CFO\u00a0of a major US public company. With Costco\u2019s leadership change \u2014 and other longtime deals like Trader Joe\u2019s\u00a019-cent bananas\u00a0and Planet Fitness\u2019\u00a0$10 membership\u00a0ending amid rising inflation \u2014 some had speculated about the future of Costco\u2019s $1.50 hot dog. The price has remained the same since 1985. If Costco\u2019s hot dog deal kept pace with inflation, it would be three times as expensive today \u2014 nearly $4.50. But Costco\u2019s $1.50 combo is a strategic decision, known as a loss-leader: The company is willing to lose money selling the hot dogs at that price as long as it helps Costco draw in and retain customers.

That comes after the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index clocked in at 48.7% in May, down from 49.2% in April. A reading below 50 indicates signs of contraction in the US manufacturing industry, while a reading above that level signals expansion. \u201cToday could mark a significant turning point in equity markets. In recent months, investors have cheered weaker-than-estimated data based on expectations that it could accelerate the start of the Fed\u2019s policy loosening. Investors are now reacting to soft data with fear,\u201d wrote Jos\u00e9 Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, in a Monday note. US Treasury yields fell on Monday. The 10-year yield declined to 4.4% as of 3 pm ET, according to Tradeweb.

The online retailer is preparing to file a prospectus with the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority for approval, ahead of a potential initial public offering (IPO) that would value it at around \u00a350 billion ($64 billion), Sky News reported Sunday, citing unnamed sources in London\u2019s financial district. If Shein goes ahead with the listing, it is expected to try to raise more than \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion) from the sale of new shares, Sky News said. Bloomberg and the Financial Times have also reported that Shein is preparing a confidential filing for a London listing. A spokesperson for Shein declined to comment on the reports. The UK\u2019s Labour Party, which is widely expected to win next month\u2019s general election, said Monday that it had met with \u201ca range of companies, including Shein, that are looking to invest or list in Britain.\u201d \u201cRaising investment, productivity and (economic) growth is one of Labour\u2019s missions for government,\u201d a party spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe expect the highest regulatory standards and business practices from any company operating in the UK. We believe the best way to ensure this is to have more companies operating from and regulated by UK law,\u201d the spokesperson added. Shein, which is headquartered in Singapore, initially hoped to go public in New York, according to several media reports, but has faced political opposition in the United States over the potential implications for US national security. In an open letter to the US securities regulator in February, Republican Senator Marco Rubio urged officials to block any potential IPO by Shein in the country if it failed to make \u201cextraordinary disclosures\u201d regarding its links w\ufeffith the Chinese government. Susannah Streeter at financial services provider Hargreaves Lansdown wrote in a note Monday: \u201cWhile New York still holds immense pulling power and was the company\u2019s first choice, plans for a listing there look unlikely given the lack of a welcome by regulators.\u201d But investors in the UK are likely to have ethical concerns about Shein\u2019s business, including a lack of transparency in its supply chain and the \u201chuge volumes of cheap clothes it produces,\u201d she said. A lifeline for London? Given its high profile and potential hefty valuation, an IPO by Shein would be a much-needed coup for the London Stock Exchange. In recent years, several companies have quit the exchange for other cities or chosen New York to go public. That includes British chipmaker Arm (ARM), which notched the biggest IPO of 2023 when it listed on New York\u2019s Nasdaq in September. Fears of London\u2019s demise were fanned again in March after Wael Sawan, the CEO of Shell (SHEL), indicated in an interview with Bloomberg that the energy giant might similarly head across the pond in search of a higher stock valuation. However, Sawan then tried to stymie such speculation on a results call with analysts last month, saying that a move to Wall Street was \u201cnot a live discussion at the moment.\u201d He added that Shell was focused on buying back its shares to help juice their value. Still, even the slightest hint that Shell could ditch London will have rattled the city\u2019s financial center.

The stunts have included using artificial intelligence to impersonate the actor Tom Cruise\u2019s voice narrating a fake documentary attacking the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and placing coffins with an inscription invoking the Ukraine war near the Eiffel Tower, sources said. The activity appears to be part of an increasingly frantic effort from Russian operatives to tarnish the Olympics and stall any momentum Ukraine is building to use Western-made weapons to attack Russian territory, experts who track Russian disinformation told CNN. The IOC has placed restrictions on Russian athletes\u2019 participation in the Paris Olympics because of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. There is a mix of desperation and opportunism to the recent spate of propaganda, said Gavin Wilde, a former Russia expert at the National Security Council. \u201cFor the tech-savvy propagandists working in Russia, the alternative they\u2019re hedging against isn\u2019t irrelevance \u2014 it\u2019s a one-way trip to the front lines,\u201d Wilde told CNN. Campaign to undermine the West The Russian operatives used the fake Cruise voice, the Netflix logo and even a fake New York Times review to try to lend the documentary legitimacy, according to analysts at Microsoft, who released a\u00a0report\u00a0on the activity on Sunday. The propaganda video, released on social media platform Telegram last year, was \u201cthe first glimpse of what would prove to be an extensive campaign\u201d by the same Russian propaganda actor to smear the Paris Olympics, Microsoft said. Russian propagandists have also been ginning up fake news stories claiming that Parisians are buying property insurance because of fears of terrorism around the Olympics, and fake press releases purporting to come from the CIA and French intelligence warning about terrorism, according to Microsoft. CNN has requested comment from the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC. Not all the recent subterfuge has been online. On Saturday, French police discovered five coffins draped in the French flag, with the words \u201cFrench soldiers in Ukraine,\u201d near the Eiffel Tower. A French military official told CNN they suspect that Russia was involved in the stunt. French police are questioning three men in connection with the incident. French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s refusal to rule out the possibility of sending French troops to Ukraine has\u00a0infuriated\u00a0the Russian government. In recent days, pro-Russia social media accounts have also shared a doctored video of US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller commenting on Ukraine\u2019s potential use of US-made weapons in Russia. The video appears to be compiled from two different press appearances by Miller, showing him wearing different ties. It\u2019s unclear who made the video. US officials and private experts have not publicly identified the source of the video. \u201cWhile this video is obviously fake, it is a step towards what counter-disinformation researchers have been warning about \u2013 the use of AI manipulated media to enhance foreign disinformation operations,\u201d the State Department said in a statement to CNN. The Russian Embassy in South Africa shared a version of the video on its X accounts,\u00a0according\u00a0to screenshots captured by a BBC journalist. Hany Farid, a digital forensic expert and professor at UC Berkley, said the video had hallmarks of being manipulate using AI. Farid ran the video through multiple deepfake detection systems and said they indicated that the voices in the video had been created using AI and that the lip movements of the State Department spokesperson in the video had been altered using lip-sync AI software. \u201cEven if the fake is not believed by everyone, the constant bombardment of deepfakes is leading to an overall skepticism of everything we see online,\u201d Farid said. But Lee Foster, another information operations expert, expressed skepticism that the imagery in the video was made using AI. \u201cLooking at it from an analytic standpoint, it doesn\u2019t make sense to use AI to manipulate mouth movements such that they are basically identical to the original,\u201d Foster told CNN. \u201cAI manipulation of the video\u2019s audio remains an unresolved question, however.\u201d Ghosts of Olympics past Russian antagonism toward the IOC has been years in the making. The IOC has prohibited Russian athletes from competing officially under the Russian flag in Paris because of the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russian athletes have faced similar restrictions at past Olympic games because of Russia\u2019s alleged doping program. Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency was behind a destructive cyberattack on computers used at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in South Korea in 2018,\u00a0according\u00a0to the US Justice Department. Officials at the Paris Olympics are bracing for a similar threat next month. \u201cThe GRU has reserved some its most serious cyberattacks for France and the Olympics, and they carried those out when the geopolitical situation was considerably less strained,\u201d said John Hultquist, chief analyst at the Google-owned cybersecurity firm Mandiant.

{"id": "2024_06_03_business_toyota-mazda-halt-shipments-japan-safety", "text": "Tokyo \u2014\u00a0A safety test scandal at Japanese automakers widened Monday, with Toyota Motor and Mazda both halting shipments of some vehicles after Japan\u2019s transport ministry found irregularities in applications to certify certain models. The irregularities were also found in applications from Honda (HMC), Suzuki and Yamaha Motor, the ministry said. The automakers were found to have submitted incorrect or manipulated safety test data when they applied for certification of the vehicles. The ministry ordered Toyota (TM), the world\u2019s biggest carmaker by the number of vehicles sold, Mazda and Yamaha to suspend shipments of some vehicles. The latest revelations came after the ministry asked automakers in January to investigate certification applications following a safety test scandal at Toyota\u2019s Daihatsu compact car unit that emerged last year. Monday\u2019s developments are also likely to heighten focus on Toyota\u2019s annual general meeting later this month. Influential proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have recommended shareholders vote against re-electing Akio Toyoda as chairman at the meeting. In a report to shareholders, ISS singled out the \u201cspate of certification irregularities\u201d at the Toyota Group. Toyoda, the grandson of the automaker\u2019s founder, told journalists Monday: \u201cAs the person in charge of the Toyota Group, I would like to sincerely apologize to our customers, to car fans, and all stakeholders for this.\u201d He said the cars had not gone through the correct certification process before being sold. Toyota said it had temporarily halted shipments and sales of three car models made in Japan. The scandals at the automakers are proving to be a sore point for the Japanese government, which has otherwise earned praise from investors and executives for its corporate reforms. Government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi called the misconduct \u201cregrettable.\u201d Shares fall Toyota said its wrongdoing had occurred during six different tests conducted in 2014, 2015, and 2020. The models affected were the Corolla Fielder, Corolla Axio and Yaris Cross, and discontinued versions of four popular models, including one sold under the Lexus luxury brand. In one example, the company had measured collision damage on one side of a model\u2019s hood while it was required to do so on both sides. Toyota also said it is still investigating issues related to vehicle fuel efficiency and emissions, and aimed to complete that inquiry by the end of June. It added that there were no performance issues that violated regulations and customers did not need to stop using their cars. Toyota shares closed down 1.8%, in contrast to a 0.9% gain in the broad Topix index. Mazda suspended shipments of its Roadster RF sports car and the Mazda2 hatchback from Thursday last week after finding that workers had modified engine control software test results, it said in a statement. It also found that crash tests of the Atenza and Axela models, which are no longer in production, had been tampered with by using a timer to set off airbags during some frontal collision tests, instead of relying on an on-board sensor to detect a hit.

Honda said it had found wrongdoing in noise and output tests over a period of more than eight years to October 2017 on some two dozen models that are no longer being produced.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/business/toyota-mazda-halt-shipments-japan-safety/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_investing_india-markets-election-modi-win-hopes-intl-hnk", "text": "Indian stock markets chalked up new record highs on Monday as experts predicted a resounding victory for incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi in national elections. India\u2019s benchmark Sensex index, which tracks 30 large companies, and the broader Nifty 50 index each ended the day at their all-time closing highs, having gained more than 3%. The surge comes after India concluded its mammoth, weeks-long election this weekend. \u201cI can say with confidence that the people of India have voted in record numbers to reelect the \u2026 government,\u201d Modi said on X on Saturday, shortly after polls closed. The 73-year-old ran on his economic record over the past 10 years, a period of robust growth for India. Results will be declared on Tuesday. In India\u2019s last election in 2019, Modi\u2019s party won 303 seats in parliament. Analysts cited multiple local exit polls that point to a much bigger Modi victory this time as the major reason for the market optimism. \u201cWith the exit polls pointing towards 370 seats mark and ahead of street expectations of 320-350 seats, markets have reacted positively,\u201d said Manish Chowdhury, head of research at brokerage\u00a0StoxBox. \u201cWe expect to see higher flows both from domestic as well as foreign investors going ahead,\u201d he added. The surge in stocks also comes after the country posted bumper economic growth numbers on Friday. The economy expanded\u00a0by more than 8% in the fiscal year that ended in March, cementing India\u2019s status as the world\u2019s fastest growing major economy. The country is comfortably placed to expand at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years, but analysts say it needs to achieve growth of\u00a08% or more\u00a0if it wants to become an economic superpower. Investors hope that if Modi wins a big majority in parliament, his government will unleash key land and labor reforms needed for the next phase of growth. Sustained expansion will push India higher up the ranks of the world\u2019s biggest economies, with some observers forecasting the country to become number three behind only the United States and China by 2027. Adani is back on top Shares in ports-to-power conglomerate Adani Group also surged on Monday. Adani Enterprises, the group\u2019s flagship firm was up over 7%, while Adani Power was up 16%. Last week, its founder Gautam Adani overtook fellow countryman Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries, to become Asia\u2019s richest man once again, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Both Ambani and Adani are considered vocal champions of Modi. Adani\u2019s rising fortunes come a year and half after his group was rocked by an unprecedented crisis when an American short-seller Hindenburg Research accused it of\u00a0engaging in fraud\u00a0over decades. Adani denounced Hindenburg\u2019s report as \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cmalicious.\u201d Since then, the tycoon has made a\u00a0remarkable comeback, with shares in some of his companies touching record highs as investors cheer his ability to adroitly bet on sectors prioritized for development by Modi. The country\u2019s stock markets have performed well during his tenure. The value of companies listed on India\u2019s exchanges surpassed $4 trillion late last year. Earlier this year, the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) overtook both the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Exchange to become the world\u2019s sixth largest bourse, data from the World Federation of Exchanges showed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/investing/india-markets-election-modi-win-hopes-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}

Now, it\u2019s being brought back to life thanks to an unexpected buyer. Hamdi Ulukaya, the billionaire founder and CEO of yogurt maker Chobani, announced Friday on LinkedIn he has purchased the San Francisco-beer brand with plans to revive Anchor Brewing\u2019s taprooms and beloved brews. Financial terms were not disclosed. Despite only visiting San Francisco a few times, Ulukaya knew that Anchor had a strong connection to the California city and was intrigued after hearing about its history into rescuing it, despite the craft beer\u2019s troubles. Anchor closed in July 2023 and its former parent company Sapporo USA put it up for sale after facing years of declining sales. Ulukaya wrote that both the city and Anchor \u201care both experiencing the magic of rebirth\u201d and that he believes \u201cbrands born in places like this deserve to be treasured, respected and loved.\u201d \u201cI was also touched by Anchor\u2019s devoted employees who have worked tirelessly to make it one of the most beloved beer brands in San Francisco and around the world. I will honor Anchor\u2019s history, and I offer my commitment to its future,\u201d he said. Anchor\u2019s remnants have been been embroiled in months-long auction process, with Sapporo offering buyers its real estate and intellectual property separately. However, Ulukaya bought it all, wanting to keep the company completely intact. Specific plans for the relaunch weren\u2019t released, including how quickly the dormant breweries can be reopened, but Ulukaya told the San Francisco Standard that he plans to bring back its old labeling. In 2021, Sapporo unveiled a new look for the beer cans and bottles in hopes to revive sales but ended up angering its hardcore fans. Despite Ulukaya\u2019s excitement about reviving the 127-year-old brand, the craft beer business has been in decline as drinkers shift to spirits and cheaper alternatives. And Anchor had its own problems prior to its closing, including the loss of national distribution, making it harder to compete. \u201cThe past year has allowed the company to become a signifier for American craft beer and what helped shape the market to what it is today, but there\u2019s also no reason to believe a new owner will suddenly allow the brewery to regain national prominence,\u201d Bryan Roth, an analyst for Feel Goods Company and editor of the alcohol beverage newsletter, Sightlines+, told\u00a0CNN. He suggested that Anchor \u201clean in as much as possible to its San Francisco and California root\u201d and focus on regional sales and reopening the taproom in the Potrero Hill neighborhood, which had become a popular place for tourists and locals. \u201cThe brand struggled because it kept relevance with longtime, committed craft beer enthusiasts, but rarely registered with young people or casual drinkers,\u201d Roth said. \u201cFocusing on\u00a0Anchors legacy, stature, and part of American craft beer history could help the brewery form new emotional connections with drinkers.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/food/anchor-brewing-chobani-hamdi-ulukaya-buyer/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}

The video game retailer\u2019s stock soared hours after a Reddit post by stocks influencer Keith Gill \u2014\u00a0also known as \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d \u2014 revealed that he had bought nearly $116 million worth of the stock. GameStop\u2019s stock surged as much as 75% earlier in the day before parings its gains. The post was the first on Gill\u2019s Reddit account in more than three years, when social media-fueled hype around GameStop (GME) shares was in full swing. Meme stocks are shares that swing wildly in value based on their popularity among trader communities on social media rather than the companies\u2019 fundamental characteristics. The frenzy started with GameStop in 2021, extending to other companies such as AMC Entertainment (AMC) and Bed, Bath and Beyond, which has since filed for bankruptcy. Shares of AMC Entertainment were up nearly 13% in morning trading on Monday. Gill also sent GameStop shares soaring last month after posting a meme on X of a man leaning forward in a chair holding a video games console \u2014\u00a0his first post on that platform in three years. GameStop had\u00a0posted a similar cartoon back in February. The meme is interpreted to mean \u201cwhen things get serious,\u201d\u00a0according to website Know Your Meme. Gill was one of the main posters on the WallStreetBets subreddit \u2014\u00a0a thread where Reddit users can post on a particular topic \u2014 which drove eye-popping rises in GameStop\u2019s stock in 2021. Retail investors bid up the shares, targeting short-sellers, who had been betting on GameStop\u2019s stock falling. Short-sellers aim to make a profit by borrowing a particular company\u2019s shares, selling them and returning them after purchasing them once they\u2019ve fallen in price. In 2021, in testimony\u00a0to US Congress\u00a0on the GameStop mania,\u00a0Gill described himself as a casual daytime trader.

This is inaccurate,\u201d Joe Erlinger,\u00a0president of McDonald\u2019s USA, wrote in an open letter posted to the company\u2019s website on Wednesday. \u201cThe average price of a Big Mac in the U.S. was $4.39 in 2019,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite a global pandemic and historic rises in supply chain costs, wages and other inflationary pressures in the years that followed, the average cost is now $5.29. That\u2019s an increase of 21% (not 100%).\u201d What Erlinger wants customers to know is not that high-priced McDonald\u2019s burgers don\u2019t exist at all. He just wants them to know that the burgers that have been cited as proof of radically higher prices are not the norm. \u201cIt frustrates and worries me, and many of our franchisees, when I hear about an $18 Big Mac meal being sold \u2014 even if it was at one location in the U.S. out of more than 13,700,\u201d he said. \u201cMore worrying, though, is when people believe that this is the rule and not the exception, or when folks start to suggest that the prices of a Big Mac have risen 100% since 2019.\u201d Online, people have been airing their fast food price grievances. But they\u2019re not just griping: Customers are pulling back on spending, too. Diners, frustrated by higher prices, are not going out to eat as often and spending less when they do, causing fast food sales to slow and traffic to dip. Erlinger is fighting back because McDonald\u2019s pricey burgers have become something of a symbol of elevated fast food prices. And being seen as overpriced could hamper sales and reputation, especially at McDonald\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that we continue to keep affordability at the forefront for our customers,\u201d McDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski said during an April 30 analyst call. \u201cWe literally wrote the playbook on value, and we are committed to upholding our leadership within the industry.\u201d To win back consumers, the burger chain is also reportedly considering adding a $5 value meal to the menu for a limited time. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported\u00a0that McDonald\u2019s is planning to start running its $5 meal promotion at the end of June. A recent statement from the National Owner\u2019s Association, a group for McDonald\u2019s franchise operators, indicated that operators were still deciding whether to adopt the promotion, which would include chicken nuggets, fries, a soft drink and either a McDouble or McChicken sandwich for $5. A NOA representative declined to comment on the status of the vote. Erlinger nodded to the possibility of a national $5 value meal in his letter. \u201cI fully expect the prices at your local McDonald\u2019s to be an area of conversation and focus in the coming months,\u201d he said. \u201cAs it does, I hope you\u2019ll see the programs we\u2019re launching nationally and locally as meaningful to you.\u201d \u2014 CNN\u2019s Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/business/mcdonalds-burger-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
