{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_investing_red-lobster-restaurants-bankruptcy", "text": "Red Lobster, which brought affordable shrimp and lobster to middle-class America and grew to become the largest seafood restaurant chain in the world, has filed for bankruptcy. The company said it had more than $1 billion in debt and less than $30 million in cash on hand. It plans to sell its business to its lenders, and in turn, it will receive financing to stay afloat. It expects to continue to close restaurants in the meantime. Red Lobster, known for its cheddar bay biscuits, crab legs and shrimp dishes, spread around the country during the 1980s and 1990s. In 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 mentioned Red Lobster in her song \u201cFormation,\u201d describing bringing a romantic partner to Red Lobster, causing sales to surge. With 578 restaurants across 44 states and Canada, Red Lobster serves 64 million customers a year, and it brings in $2 billion in annual sales, the company said in its bankruptcy filing. One in five lobster tails purchased in North America is bought by Red Lobster. But recent mismanagement, competition, inflation and other factors brought down Red Lobster, analysts and former Red Lobster employees say. Years of underinvestment in Red Lobster\u2019s marketing, food quality, service and restaurant upgrades hurt the chain\u2019s ability to compete with growing fast-casual and quick-service chains. Pioneering chain Red Lobster started in 1968 by Bill Darden, an architect of the casual dining revolution in America, and General Mills soon bought the restaurant. Red Lobster later became part of Darden Restaurants, the owner of Olive Garden and other chains. In 2014, Darden sold off Red Lobster to Golden Gate Capital, a private equity firm, for $2.1 billion. Since 2020, seafood distributor Thai Union Group, based in Thailand, has been the largest Red Lobster shareholder. Thai Union owns 49% of the company. But Red Lobster has struggled under Thai Union. The number of customers coming to Red Lobster tumbled 30% since 2019 and has only slightly improved since the pandemic. Earlier this year, Thai Union said it would divest from Red Lobster and take a $530 million loss on its investment. Former Red Lobster employees say Thai Union\u2019s cost-cutting efforts and strategy mistakes hurt the chain. \u201cThai Union forced huge cost reductions, including many that were penny wise and pound foolish because they hurt sales,\u201d a former Red Lobster executive who spoke under the condition of anonymity because of a non-disclosure agreement with the company told CNN earlier this month. Thai Union did not respond to requests for comment on that article. Red Lobster executives began to run for the doors under Thai Union\u2019s management, resulting in a huge amount of C-suite churn. Red Lobster has had five CEOs since 2021. In 2021 and 2022, Red Lobster brought on a new CEO, chief marketing officer, chief financial officer and chief information officer. All were gone within two years. Last summer, under Thai Union, Red Lobster turned $20 endless shrimp into a permanent item on the menu for the first time, instead of its traditional limited-time offer deal. The change cost the company $11 million and cut into Thai Union profit. In its bankruptcy filing, Red Lobster said it is investigating the circumstances of that promotion, which the company\u2019s management opposed. \u201cWe need to be much more careful,\u201d Thai Union CFO Ludovic Garnier said on an earnings call in November 2023. But the company in its bankruptcy filing blamed Thai Union for the losses. Noting that under the guise of a \u201cquality review,\u201d Red Lobster eliminated two of its breaded shrimp suppliers, leaving Thai Union with an exclusive deal. That led to higher costs for the restaurant chain, and did not comply with the company\u2019s typical decision-making process for picking suppliers based on projected demand. The explosive growth and popularity of fast-casual chains like Chipotle and quick-service chains like Chick-fil-A over the past two decades also squeezed Red Lobster. Casual dining has slipped from 36% of total restaurant industry sales in 2013 to 31% in 2023, according to Technomic, a restaurant research firm. In its bankruptcy filing, Red Lobster conceded it had \u201ca bloated and underperforming restaurant footprint\u201d and cited a difficult economic environment and increased competition for its recent financial failures. Bankruptcy plans Red Lobster has been telegraphing its bankruptcy for months. In January, the company hired Jonathan Tibus, a restructuring veteran, to assess its business. It named Tibus as CEO in March. Last week, the company began shutting down 93 restaurants in preparation for its bankruptcy. As it ran out of cash, the company stopped paying its vendors last year. The company plans to stay afloat with a $100 million financing agreement, it said in its bankruptcy petition.

{"id": "2024_05_23_business_pinduoduo-temu-us-ecommerce-bargains-intl-hnk", "text": "PDD Holdings, the owner of Temu and Pinduoduo, is blowing past market expectations with a massive surge in profit and revenue as American and Chinese consumers swarm its bargain shopping apps for low-cost products. The Shanghai-based company reported Wednesday that net profit soared 246% to 28 billion yuan ($3.9 billion) in the first quarter of 2024, more than double the average analyst estimate of 12.62 billion yuan ($1.7 billion), according to LSEG data. Revenue jumped 131% to 86.81 billion yuan ($12 billion) in the period, also comfortably beating expectations. Nomura analysts said that the growth momentum was coming from \u201cboth home and abroad.\u201d The strong results boosted shares of PDD\u2019s (PDD) Nasdaq-listed shares Wednesday, propelling its market value past $204 billion and making it China\u2019s most valuable e-commerce company, ahead of Alibaba (BABA). Hangzhou-based Alibaba has long dominated China\u2019s online industry, but it has been facing stiff competition from rivals and increased regulatory scrutiny from Beijing. PDD was founded by Colin Huang in 2015, who stepped down in 2021 as chairman, to pursue a personal interest in life sciences. He is still the company\u2019s biggest shareholder, with a stake of 25% stake, and ranks as China\u2019s second richest man with a fortune of nearly $52 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Temu, PDD\u2019s international app, was launched in 2022, and as of last November it had acquired nearly 17% of the US online discount store market, according to Earnest Analytics. Its Pinduoduo app also continues to grow in China. By mid-2023, Pinduoduo had seen its e-commerce market share rise to 19% from 7.2% in 2019, according to Chinese analytics firm Yinma Data Research. It trailed behind Alibaba\u2019s Taobao and Tmall, which owned a combined 44%, and JD.com, which held 24%. Just eight years old, the startup has successfully leveraged a shift in consumption patterns in the world\u2019s second largest economy. As the Chinese economy slows and job prospects worsen, people are penny-pinching on everything from groceries to electronics and cars. Discounts and special deals are being offered across brands, including Western companies that primarily target premium markets. American consumers are also becoming more price aware after two years of elevated inflation. A slew of retailers have announced price cuts in recent weeks to entice people to spend money on things like new clothes and decorative items for the home. Several investment banks and brokerage firms, including Morgan Stanley and Nomura, increased their price targets for PDD stock after it disclosed the results. But the company acknowledged that the competition is going to get more intense as rivals try harder to lure consumers with more price cuts. \u201cWe are seeing that our industry peers have significantly stepped up their efforts,\u201d said Lei Chen, co-CEO and chairman of PDD at an earnings call on Wednesday. Chen said the company must do its best to keep up with consumer market changes. \u201cIn addition to offering more savings, we are also expected to meet consumers\u2019 needs for higher quality products,\u201d he said. PDD is also facing potential regulatory hurdles in international markets as it expands globally. Earlier this month, a European consumer group accused Temu of using \u201cmanipulative techniques\u201d to get consumers to spend more than they might want, and called for a regulatory probe into the app. Last month, South Korean regulators investigated Temu on suspicion of false advertising and unfair ppractices, according to the Yonhap news agency. Chen said Wednesday that the company is \u201cactively\u201d engaging with regulatory bodies in various countries with \u201ca learning mindset.\u201d \u201cAs our business grows, consumers and regulatory bodies are holding us accountable for ever-higher compliance requirements and also the merchants doing business with us,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/business/pinduoduo-temu-us-ecommerce-bargains-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "business_retailers-crackdown-organized-crime-invs", "text": "When SWAT officers swarmed a house in a sleepy San Jose, California neighborhood last month, they found what could best be described as a make-shift hardware store inside: Shelves lined with boxes of brand-new tools, bathroom fixtures and spools of industrial wiring. It resembled a mini Home Depot. And in some ways, it was. Much of the cache of products\u2014worth about $150,000\u2014had been stolen from real Home Depot stores.\u00a0The retail chain\u2019s internal security force spent months investigating the thefts, scanning security camera footage, tracking license plates and surveilling suspects. They connected dots of the criminal network allegedly responsible and shared their findings with the Santa Clara County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which executed search warrants and arrested the suspects. Increasingly, this is how it goes today for retailers trying to battle theft and fraud by organized crime rings. A CNN review of court records and interviews with more than two dozen retail and law enforcement officials shows that persistent problems with sophisticated organized crime networks have led many private-sector companies to not only assist law enforcement but to often deliver the bulk of the evidence that leads to criminal prosecutions. Anyone who has shopped at retail stores in recent years has encountered everyday products like laundry detergent, medication and beauty supplies locked up behind metal gates or plexiglass. Retailers say those in-store security measures are emblematic of the ongoing threat of organized retail crime, which typically involves groups of low-level thieves who steal items for middlemen who in turn sell to unsuspecting customers hunting for deals on marketplaces such as Amazon or eBay. Efforts to counter this crime, however, have come with some costs. Security investments can translate into higher prices for consumers, and civil liberties advocates argue the surveillance technology used by retailers can infringe on individuals\u2019 privacy. While retailers have long partnered with law enforcement, the industry has bolstered its role in recent years, devoting more staff and financial resources to thwarting theft. Some retailers are researching body-worn cameras for employees. Others, including Home Depot, have invested in police-like investigation centers to sift through data and pinpoint theft-group members. \u201cA lot of times, local and state resources don\u2019t have the capacity to investigate these crimes at that scale,\u201d said Sean Browne, senior manager of asset protection for Home Depot. Browne said Home Depot, which has nearly tripled its investigative team since 2016,  has started using license-plate readers in some store parking lots. \u201cWe try to full-service the investigations and ensure we cut off the head of the snake.\u201d Where law enforcement agencies sometimes face jurisdictional limits to their investigations, retailers can track cases across state and county lines with increasingly sophisticated tools \u2013 such as artificial intelligence that identifies patterns \u2013 and choose agencies with which to share cases. \u201cRetailers themselves are really taking the ball and running with it and then partnering with law enforcement at all levels,\u201d said David Johnston, vice president of asset protection for the National Retail Federation (NRF), a top lobbying group for the retail industry. NRF surveys of retailers\u00a0last year found that more than half reported budget increases to combat organized retail crime. Precise national data on organized retail crime is lacking. Last year, NRF even retracted a claim in one of its reports related to the scale of the crime, which led critics to charge that the industry had exaggerated the issue to achieve policy goals or justify store closures caused by underperformance. Still, most retailers insist they have seen an uptick in organized theft. About 90% of asset-protection professionals surveyed last year by NRF said the crime had become more of a risk over the prior three years. \u201cThese investments wouldn\u2019t be made for no reason,\u201d said Browne of Home Depot, which has also added security to stores like locks, gates, cameras and other tech to deter theft. \u201cUnfortunately, this creates an environment for our customers that isn\u2019t very friendly,\u201d he said. A complex crime The industry\u2019s push to crack down on organized retail crime comes amidst differing policies and law enforcement priorities across the nation. Some states have focused on tackling such theft, with more than a dozen launching organized retail crime taskforces, which collaborate with private companies and police. Investigators for the attorney general of Washington state, which created an organized retail crime unit last year, specifically credited businesses Target and Ulta Beauty for gathering much of the evidence\u00a0behind two felony cases, according to probable-cause affidavits. That material included loss prevention reports, security footage and photographs. In the case involving Ulta Beauty, a company investigator identified the defendant and accomplices who\u00a0allegedly stole products across six counties, according to an affidavit. \u201cWe can\u2019t bring the cases without them,\u201d Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said when asked by CNN about the role of retailers. \u201cEverything you\u2019re seeing in those probable-cause statements is what you would see in case after case after case as we go forward with this work.\u201d Ferguson said organized retail crime cases are inherently complex to investigate and prosecute, especially for local agencies with limited resources, so public-private partnerships are a necessity. That was evident in the case of Linda Ann Been, an Oklahoma woman sentenced to more than five years in prison earlier this month for managing an organized theft ring that federal prosecutors say stole about $9 million in property from retailers. The case largely began with an investigator for CVS\u00a0who noticed a trend of thefts at his company\u2019s stores in the Tulsa area, according to a state affidavit. He then used records to link low-level thieves who physically robbed the stores with Been and shared his findings with a local detective. The investigation later revealed how Been had provided the thieves with lists of items to steal from businesses across multiple states. The items were organized at a warehouse and boutique clothing shop in a suburb of Tulsa and sold by Been to other sellers \u2013 known as \u201cfences\u201d \u2013 outside of Oklahoma who in turn sold the products through websites, including eBay and Amazon, to customers, documents show. In a brief interview with CNN prior to her sentencing, Been questioned why those higher-level fences to whom she sold products appear not to have faced consequences. \u201cHow come \u2026 nothing happened to those people?\u201d she asked. In her guilty plea in 2022, Been specifically named one such fence to whom she \u201cfrequently sent stolen inventory\u201d as a man named Baruch \u201cButch\u201d Treff. Treff, in an interview with CNN, acknowledged buying products from Been, whom he said other vendors had recommended, but insisted he had no idea she had traded in stolen goods. \u201cIf I knew I would never have bought from her. I don\u2019t deal with stolen goods,\u201d Treff said. An attorney for Treff, Yosef Jacobovitch, added that his client did due diligence and met with Been to try to ensure she was a legitimate vendor. \u201cShe fooled him and others,\u201d Jacobovitch said. A government investigator familiar with the case, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said one of the challenges of such cases is determining whether higher-level fences knowingly purchased stolen goods for resale. The case against Been\u2019s organization\u00a0involved a range of state and federal authorities including Homeland Security Investigations and the IRS, but during a news conference, a federal prosecutor credited retail-industry investigators for contributing and called such collaborations a \u201cforce multiplier.\u201d Aside from supplying evidence, retailers sometimes identify broader trends of groups moving from city to city before law enforcement, said Sgt. Patrick Flynn of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department\u2019s organized retail crime unit, which launched last year. Patrick Walsh, an organized-retail-crime manager for grocery chain Kroger, said his company has heavily invested not only in its investigative capacity but also visual deterrents. For example, the company purchased an old police car to drive around parking lots to ward off would-be criminals. Some companies\u2019 efforts have backfired. In December, drugstore chain Rite Aid agreed to a five-year ban on facial recognition technology after the Federal Trade Commission found\u00a0that the company\u2019s use of the tech led to false shoplifting allegations against customers \u2013 especially people of color\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who appeared to match entries in a company watchlist. A Rite Aid spokesperson said the company is enhancing its information-security practices and policies. The way retailers have collected evidence for police with such tech has alarmed privacy-rights advocates. \u201cPolice are public entities. You can send them a public records request. You can elect a mayor who may want to change the police department. You cannot do that with a giant corporation. You have very little control over what technology they deploy, how they deploy it and then what they do with that data,\u201d said Matthew Guariglia, a senior policy analyst with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. Calls for more federal action The threat of organized retail crime and pressure from the industry has led some officials to call on the federal government to do more. Over the last year much of that push has centered on a federal bill, the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act, that would create an intelligence-sharing hub at the Department of Homeland Security and broaden the scope of applicable criminal conduct. San Diego County\u00a0District Attorney Summer Stephan, a Republican-turned-independent who expressed support for those changes at a congressional hearing in December, referred to limited coordination between law enforcement and retailers\u00a0and laws that apply relatively light penalties for habitual thieves as \u201ckey challenges\u201d in policing the issue. The bill has received\u00a0criticism. A coalition of civil rights groups that included the ACLU and NAACP argued in a letter in March that the legislation promotes punitive policies that would disproportionately affect marginalized communities and exacerbate poverty by pushing more crime into the federal system. \u201cThis enforcement-first response, we don\u2019t think that leads to crime deterrence,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 White, an attorney with one of those groups, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, told CNN. The bill has garnered support from a bipartisan group of lawmakers, but it has not advanced. \u201cEverything is stalled in Congress,\u201d said Rep. Dina Titus, a Nevada Democrat who helped introduce the legislation. Reacting to the way private retailers have been growing their internal investigative efforts, Titus said, \u201cThat\u2019s the reason we need to do something at the federal level\u2026 I\u2019m not trying to put down local law enforcement. I think they are doing the best they can with the resources they have.\u201d Congress has taken some steps to help the retail industry. A law that took effect last year requires online marketplaces to verify and disclose information on large, third-party sellers, such as bank account numbers. The law in effect makes it harder to sell stolen products through the internet with impunity. But industry sources argue online platforms could do more to police organized retail crime on their sites. Specifically, those marketplaces should more proactively question high-volume sellers of discounted goods and \u201cask for proof that these goods have been acquired lawfully,\u201d said Khris Hamlin, vice president of asset protection for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. Major online marketplaces say they have taken steps to combat such crime. Amazon touts a program that applies unique codes to certain products that can be used to detect and track stolen items. Mike Carson, eBay\u2019s senior director of global policy, said eBay has safeguards including automated processes that flag irregularities among items for sale, which can prompt further investigation. Browne of Home Depot said he welcomes more assistance from online marketplaces and the federal government. \u201cCrimes like drugs, human trafficking, they have major organizations going after this and rightfully so. Retail crimes have not gotten that same attention over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s expanded beyond the bandwidth of local and sometimes even state law enforcement.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nelli Black and Yahya Abou-Ghazala contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/retailers-crackdown-organized-crime-invs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_tech_fcc-weighs-ai-rules-political-ads", "text": "The Federal Communications Commission is taking initial steps toward new rules that could require political ads on TV and radio to include disclaimers about the use of artificial intelligence. On Wednesday, FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel called on other agency commissioners to support such regulations amid growing fears that AI-generated deepfakes could disrupt elections. \u201cAs artificial intelligence tools become more accessible, the Commission wants to make sure consumers are fully informed when the technology is used,\u201d Rosenworcel said in a news release.\u00a0\u201cToday, I\u2019ve shared with my colleagues a proposal that makes clear consumers have a right to know when AI tools are being used in the political ads they see, and I hope they swiftly act on this issue.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s proposal aims to open a rulemaking process at the FCC that would likely take months to play out. The proposal calls for new rules governing broadcast TV and radio, as well as cable and satellite providers. Under the proposed rules, political advertisers on those mediums would have to make on-air disclosures if their ads contain AI-generated content. The FCC does not regulate internet-based media such as streaming video services or social media. As part of the proposed rule, political advertisers would also have to provide written disclosures in the files that broadcasters are\u00a0required to make available\u00a0to the public. The FCC move seeks to fill\u00a0a yawning gap\u00a0in the regulation of artificial intelligence in political advertising. Existing US election law prohibits campaigns from \u201cfraudulently misrepresenting other candidates or political parties,\u201d but whether this prohibition extends to AI-generated content is an open question. Last summer,\u00a0Republicans on the Federal Election Commission blocked\u00a0a move that could have made clear the law extended to AI-created depictions; the FEC has since agreed to revive the discussion, but it has not reached a decision on the matter. In the meantime, some US lawmakers have proposed legislation that could clamp down on AI in elections. In March, a bipartisan proposal by Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski unveiled the\u00a0AI Transparency in Elections Act, which could require AI disclaimers on political ads. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, has stressed the urgent need for Congress to create guardrails for artificial intelligence, particularly for elections. Last week, he and a bipartisan group of senators\u00a0released a blueprint\u00a0for legislative action. But many\u00a0policy analysts doubt\u00a0that Congress can pass meaningful AI legislation during an election year. Online platforms such as Meta have taken their own steps to address AI in political ads,\u00a0requiring campaigns\u00a0to disclose the use of deepfakes and banning the use of its\u00a0in-house generative AI tools\u00a0for political advertising.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/tech/fcc-weighs-ai-rules-political-ads/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) soared more than 9%\u00a0as the wider market dropped lower, highlighting a lack of market breadth. (Nvidia is not one of the 30 stocks that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average.) Boeing (BA) weighed on markets on Thursday, dropping more than 7.5% after the beleaguered aircraft manufacturer said its cash flows were worse than expected this year. That caused concern amongst investors that its debt ratings could be classified as junk bonds. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, which began the day at new intraday highs, fell by 0.7% and 0.4%, respectively. The Dow, meanwhile, closed lower by 606 points, or 1.5%.

April new home sales missed estimates on Thursday, coming in at an annualized rate of 634,000 versus 678,000 expected.

The minutes showed that \u201cvarious\u201d officials said they would be willing to raise interest rates if necessary and that there were doubts as to whether financial conditions are restrictive enough to keep inflation from resurging. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon also said Wednesday at an event hosted by Boston College that the Fed probably won\u2019t begin to cut rates this year. \u201cI\u2019m still at zero cuts,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re set up for stickier inflation.\u201d \u201cThe bond market set the dour mood that we see across much of the market,\u201d wrote Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick on Thursday.

{"id": "2024_05_23_tech_live-nation-antitrust-violations-doj-lawsuit", "text": "In a groundbreaking antitrust lawsuit that threatens to upend the way concertgoers pay for tickets, the US government and dozens of states sued Live Nation on Thursday, alleging that for years the parent company of Ticketmaster abused its industry dominance to harm fans nationwide. The long-expected suit, filed in New York by the Justice Department and 30 state and district attorneys general, challenges the country\u2019s biggest ticketing website and concert promoter, which regulators allege was the mastermind of a plan to stifle competition. The governments are seeking a jury trial and a breakup of the company. If successful, the case could lead to sweeping changes in the market for live events \u2013 an industry that came under intense scrutiny in 2022 after glitches at Ticketmaster blocked millions from purchasing tickets for Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cEras\u201d tour. For many critics of Live Nation, the Swift debacle revealed how a lack of competition has led to harms ranging from poor customer service to confusing pricing to expensive ticketing fees to restrictions on ticket resales \u2014 amounting to what many consumers complain of as death by a thousand cuts. But fans hoping to save money aren\u2019t yet out of the woods, as the suit will likely take years to make its way through the court system. Meanwhile, the exorbitant fees they know all too well aren\u2019t likely to be dramatically affected. In a statement, Live Nation called the DOJ\u2019s allegations \u201cbaseless.\u201d \u201cThe DOJ\u2019s lawsuit won\u2019t solve the issues fans care about relating to ticket prices, service fees, and access to in-demand shows,\u201d Live Nation said in a statement. \u201cCalling Ticketmaster a monopoly may be a PR win for the DOJ in the short term, but it will lose in court because it ignores the basic economics of live entertainment.\u201d Unlike some of the other businesses DOJ has sued, Live Nation does not reap enormous profits from its market position, the company added. \u201cLive Nation\u2019s net profit margin last fiscal year was 1.4% - nowhere near other DOJ targets in the tech sector,\u201d the company said in a statement, noting Apple and Google \u2013 both subjects of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust lawsuits, have margins north of 24%. Shares of Live Nation (LYV) fell 5% on the news. Not just frustrating \u2026 it\u2019s illegal, DOJ says Attorney General Merrick Garland in a press conference Thursday rattled off a seemingly endless list of fees Ticketmaster charges customers. \u201cThose include: ticketing fees, service fees, convenience fees, platinum fees, per-order fees, handling fees and payment processing fees, among others.\u201d But Garland noted the annoyance isn\u2019t why the Justice Department sued. \u201cWe\u2019re here not because Ticketmaster\u2019s conduct is inconvenient or frustrating \u2026 we\u2019re here because it\u2019s illegal,\u201d Garland said. Prosecutors allege that Live Nation\u2019s end game was to monopolize the ticketing and live events industry by cutting exclusive deals with the country\u2019s largest venues, ensuring that all their future events were ticketed through the company\u2019s platform. According to the lawsuit,\u00a0Live Nation directly manages more than 400 artists, controls around 60% of concert promotions at major concert venues across the country, and controls more than 265 concert venues in North America. And through Ticketmaster, the suit says, Live Nation controls roughly 80% or more of major concert venues\u2019 primary ticketing for concerts. \u201cWe allege that Live Nation relies on unlawful, anticompetitive conduct to exercise its monopolistic control over the live events industry in the United States at the cost of fans, artists, smaller promoters, and venue operators,\u201d said Garland in a statement. \u201cThe result is that fans pay more in fees, artists have fewer opportunities to play concerts, smaller promoters get squeezed out, and venues have fewer real choices for ticketing services. It is time to break up Live Nation-Ticketmaster.\u201d Bad blood Musicians, too, have complained of Live Nation\u2019s tightly integrated operation, which combines event ticketing services with control of roughly 200 popular US venues, a linkage that critics say allows the company to dictate terms and fees to artists. Reacting in 2022 to the Ticketmaster fiasco that enraged her fans, Swift wrote on Instagram that the situation was \u201cexcruciating for me\u201d and \u201cpisses me off.\u201d The company also has bad blood with several other artists who have taken aim at Live Nation\u2019s practices, including The Cure front man Robert Smith, who said he was \u201csickened\u201d by Ticketmaster\u2019s fees, and country singer Zach Bryan, who in 2022 released a collection of live performances entitled \u201cAll My Homies Hate Ticketmaster (Live at Red Rocks).\u201d Garland in his press conference talked about his personal experience going to a Bonnie Raitt concert in high school and seeing Bruce Springsteen as a warmup act. \u201cWe all knew we had just seen the future of rock and roll,\u201d he mused. \u201cThe Justice Department filed this lawsuit for fans who should be able to go to concerts without a monopoly standing in their way.\u201d Ticketmaster competitors were pleased by the lawsuit. \u201cFor nearly fifteen years, the Ticketmaster and Live Nation monopoly has ignored the fan experience: fans have been limited to a singular platform only to suffer through a consumer experience that fails them repeatedly,\u201d StubHub said in a statement. \u201cWe hope it creates a healthier ticketing market, one that empowers competition, drives innovation, and places the fan experience at the forefront.\u201d An unpopular merger Now, the US government is\u202fopposing Live Nation\u2019s economic power for the first time since the company merged with Ticketmaster in 2010. Regulators chose to tolerate it at the time; rather than sue to block the deal, they imposed certain obligations on the company meant to anticipate potential harms that the merger might cause. The lawsuit will likely be cheered by antitrust advocates who say they knew the Live Nation-Ticketmaster merger was trouble from the start. Among the deal\u2019s critics are US lawmakers including Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who as far back as 2019 were calling on the Justice Department to investigate Live Nation for not living up to its commitments. Klobuchar, Blumenthal and a number of other senators including Texas Republican Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz have proposed numerous bills to regulate the ticketing industry. \u201cThe Justice Department is doing the right thing today by seeking to break up this monopoly that has long harmed fans, artists, and venues,\u201d Klobuchar said in a statement. \u201cIn addition to holding Live Nation accountable, I\u2019ve also fought to create common sense guardrails to promote healthy competition in the ticketing market, and I will continue to work towards passing my bipartisan legislation that would do just that.\u201d The lawsuit highlights how regulators now believe, more than a decade on, that the behavioral modifications Live Nation agreed to have failed. Those claims dovetail with a wider push by the Biden administration ramping up antitrust enforcement across the entire economy, with officials blaming decades of lax enforcement for a wave of consolidation and a reduction in consumer power. The request for a jury trial is unusual: Recent antitrust lawsuits have asked for a judge to rule, because they can be long and get into complicated law. The list of states and districts participating in Thursday\u2019s suit includes Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming and the District of Columbia, according to the court docket in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. \u201cFor too long, Live Nation and Ticketmaster have unfairly and illegally run the world of live events, abusing their dominance to overcharge fans, bully venues, and limit artists,\u201d said\u00a0New York Attorney General Letitia James in a statement. \u201cEverybody agrees, Live Nation and Ticketmaster are the problem and it\u2019s time for a new era.\u201d This is a developing story. It will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/tech/live-nation-antitrust-violations-doj-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

Did you think markets reacted appropriately to last week\u2019s cooling inflation data?\u00a0 It\u2019s interesting to me that the equity market is cheering the idea that the Fed is going to be cutting rates.\u00a0If the equity market is cheering the fact that the Fed is going to extend the current economic cycle by cutting rates a couple of times, I would agree with that. I just think we have to be careful. There tends to be a fine line between cutting rates and extending the economic cycle or cutting rates because the cycle is coming to an end (and the economy is softening). All investors are really going to have to grapple with that in the coming months. Our view is that you start cutting now and you actually can extend the cycle. What do you mean exactly by extending the cycle? When the Fed is cutting rates, it\u2019s cutting rates because a recession is about to happen, right? That happens almost every single time where the Fed is cutting and recession is upon us. That\u2019s why I say there\u2019s a fine line between the Fed cutting to extend the cycle and the Fed cutting because a recession is about to happen. You really are threading a needle here. The Fed has been in this precarious space where they\u2019re trying to avoid recession while lowering interest rates. How have they done in shaping a narrative around that?\u00a0 I think you have to go back to last July. We were at 4.2%, from a core inflation perspective, that\u2019s more than double the target rate. But the Fed decided that they were done with this hiking cycle. So when you hear about the dovish pivot that happened in December, it didn\u2019t happen in December, it happened in July. (Fed Chair Jerome Powell) was taking a bit of a risk there, but part of why he shifted is because he recognized that the more aggressive the Fed goes from there, the greater damage they could do to the labor backdrop. He kept on highlighting in subsequent meetings that we cannot wait for inflation to get to 2%. Because then we run the risk of doing much more economic damage. He has tried to present themselves as a hawk. But in the end, I think Jay Powell is actually more of a dove. A lot of his actions, going back to July, are really consistent with that. I have a lot of sympathy for what he\u2019s trying to do. He\u2019s trying to engineer that ever elusive soft landing and I think he could succeed. When it comes to inflation, he can\u2019t take his eye completely off the ball, but I know that labor is top of mind right now. Do you still think the Fed will cut rates in September?\u00a0 If we\u2019re right that Powell\u2019s inclination is to cut, September is in play. And if we get a string of better inflation data between now and September, I don\u2019t doubt for a second that September is in play. How does the November election come into play? If you go back and look over the past 10 election years, it becomes clear that the Fed does adjust policy during election years. Full stop. So I think it\u2019s very fair to say that the Fed will respond to the economic reality on the ground and if the economic reality demands that the Fed adjust rates, even in an election year, even in an election month, the Fed will do it because the Fed has always done it. What happens if the Fed doesn\u2019t cut? The longer we see no cuts, the greater the risk is that you see many cuts later. There are already some signs that the economic backdrop is already weakening. You can look at rising consumer delinquency rates as an example of how higher rates are starting to clamp down again. From a corporate perspective, companies are now in the midst of refinancing. They\u2019re hitting a maturity speed bump with their debt. They\u2019re refinancing at 1 or 2 percentage points higher than where they were pre-pandemic. That could feed through to the broader economic backdrop. Right now, we have a consumer that\u2019s hanging in there, but they\u2019re starting the process of slowing their spending. That means that you\u2019re going to start to see some potential for margin compression. If you start to see margins compress in companies that are now refinancing at higher rates, you can exacerbate things. And so what do companies do? How do companies tackle margin compression, particularly if they\u2019re not able to pass on costs to the same extent that they were in recent years? They do three things. From a labor perspective, they go after hours \u2014 hours are being cut right now. If that\u2019s not enough, they try to lower wages, they\u2019re doing that right now, too. And if those two things are not enough, then the last thing you do is you go after headcount. That to me is the risk if the Fed doesn\u2019t cut anytime soon. Disneyland character performers vote to unionize You can add Mickey, Minnie, Donald and Goofy to the growing list of workers seeking better employment benefits, reports my colleague Eva Rothenberg. After three days of voting last week, 1,700 Disneyland Resort cast members who play characters around the theme park in Anaheim, California, as well as perform at parades, voted to unionize under Actors\u2019 Equity Association, the\u00a0union announced\u00a0Saturday night. Equity described the vote as \u201ca landslide victory,\u201d with 953 cast members favoring unionization and 258 opposed. The group had announced a union organizing effort in February before filing for a\u00a0vote with the National Labor Relations Board\u00a0in April. There are more than 21,000 Disneyland \u201ccast member\u201d employees, who are represented by more than a dozen unions. Those unionized jobs include workers in retail, food service, security, pyrotechnic, and hair and makeup. Until now, employees dressing up as iconic Disney characters like Mickey Mouse, Cinderella, Snow White and Captain Hook have been excluded. \u201cThese workers are on the front lines of the Guest experience; they\u2019re the human beings who create lifelong memories when your kids hug a character, or when your family watches a parade roll by the castle,\u201d said Actors\u2019 Equity Association President Kate Shindle in a statement. \u201cThe next step will be to collaborate with them about improving health & safety, wages, benefits, working conditions and job security.\u201d The labor relations board is expected to certify the results next week, after which contract negotiations with The Walt Disney Company will begin. Equity said it does not know how long the bargaining process will take, adding Disney has been \u201crelatively cooperative throughout this process.\u201d Minnesota lawmakers strike minimum pay deal for Uber, Lyft drivers Minnesota government officials have struck a deal with rideshare companies Uber and Lyft to set minimum wage standards for drivers, lawmakers announced Saturday night. The agreement is the culmination of\u00a0nearly a year of back and forth\u00a0between Democratic state officials and the two companies, who threatened to withdraw their businesses from Minnesota over a proposed Minneapolis ordinance that would grant rideshare drivers increased worker protections. The ordinance, initially adopted in August 2023, was part of a larger effort to grant more comprehensive benefits to contract workers, who take\u00a0freelance work at digital platforms\u00a0like DoorDash, Instacart, Uber and Lyft. It mandated drivers be paid at least $1.40 per mile and $0.51 per minute. The rule was delayed after\u00a0Lyft and Uber warned they would leave Minneapolis. State lawmakers have been focused on compromising with the companies before a July 1 deadline. Under the new agreement, the statewide minimum wage rate for rideshare drivers will be $1.28 per mile and $0.31 per minute. The rule will override the higher rate the Minneapolis City Council had initially proposed. \u201cWhen you take it as a blended rate, that results in a 20% increase in pay for drivers in the state of Minnesota,\u201d the state\u2019s Democratic\u00a0House Majority Leader Jamie Long told reporters Saturday night.

{"id": "2024_05_23_business_someone-tried-to-steal-graceland", "text": "We can\u2019t be 100% sure that an obscure lending company just tried to steal Graceland. But a Tennessee judge on Wednesday said, essentially, it sure looks like that\u2019s what happened. It is a truly bananas series of events that led to Graceland, a beloved tourist attraction in Memphis, getting pulled from the auction block just one day before it was scheduled for a foreclosure sale. ICYMI: Elvis Presley\u2019s family home \u2014 the second most-visited residence in America after the White House \u2014 was set to go up for auction this Thursday, under the pretext that the late singer\u2019s daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, who died in 2023, failed to pay back a $3.8 million loan she\u2019d secured from a private lender called Naussany Investments\u00a0and Private Lending. Naussany claimed that the house was part of the collateral on that loan, and payment was due, so get ready to kiss Graceland goodbye. But earlier this month, Riley Keough, Elvis\u2019s granddaughter and the sole owner of Graceland, swooped in to halt the sale. Keough, an actor known for her roles in \u201cMad Max Fury Road\u201d and \u201cDaisy Jones\u00a0& the Six,\u201d filed a lawsuit saying, essentially, Naussany\u2019s claims were all garbage. Keough contends there was no such loan made to her mother. And that Naussany isn\u2019t even a real company. Her lawsuit says that the documents Naussany presented, including a 2018 notarized promissory note signed by Lisa Marie Presley, were forged. Even the notary public whose name appeared on the disputed document, told the court in an affidavit that no, they\u2019d never notarized Lisa Marie Presley\u2019s signature. On Wednesday, Shelby County Chancellor JoeDae Jenkins said that the affidavit was sufficient evidence to delay the foreclosure until a hearing can determine the facts. But Jenkins also suggested pretty overtly that someone, somewhere, did some frauds. \u201cIt appears you\u2019ll be successful on the merits,\u201d Jenkins told Keough\u2019s lawyer Wednesday. When CNN attempted to reach Naussany Investments, the number was no longer in service. The business was listed in a court document from Keough\u2019s attorney as being located in Kimberling City, Missouri, but CNN was unable to locate a business in the state of Missouri by that name. CNN was also unable to locate a business by that name when searching nationwide. Then, on Wednesday, a person\u00a0identified as a representative of\u00a0Naussany Investments released a grammatically challenged and somewhat confusing statement saying they \u201cwill be withdrawing all claims with prejudice.\u201d \u201cDue to the Deed of Trust not being recorded and the loan being obtained in different state, legal action would have to be filed in multiple states and\u00a0Naussany\u00a0Investments & Private Lending will not acquire to proceed,\u201d the company said. (\u201cNot acquire to proceed?\u201d) It added: \u201cThere was no harm meant on Ms. Keough for her mothers LMP mis habits and mis managing of money.\u201d (LMP, presumably, is Lisa Marie Presley. As for \u201cmis habits,\u201d your guess is as good as mine.) Bottom line: If Keough is right and this is a case of forgery and fraud, then it\u2019s surely a contender for one of the all-time most foolish. (And, as we know, only fools rush in.) Scammers and predatory lenders pull off all kinds of immoral and illegal schemes all the time, but most of them have the good sense not to prey on the multimillion-dollar estate of one the world\u2019s most beloved cultural icons. If you pitched a movie script about it, the writers of the National Treasure movies would laugh you out of the room.

Musk, the billionaire head of SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA), arrived on the Indonesian resort island of Bali by private jet before attending the launch ceremony at a community health center in the provincial capital, Denpasar.

Asked about whether he planned to also invest in Indonesia\u2019s electric vehicle industry,\u00a0Musk\u00a0said he was focused on Starlink first. \u201cWe are focusing this event on Starlink and the benefits that connectivity brings to remote islands,\u201d he said, \u201cI think it\u2019s really to emphasize the importance of internet connectivity, how much of that can be a lifesaver.\u201d Indonesia\u2019s government has been trying for years to lure\u00a0Musk\u2019s auto firm Tesla to build manufacturing plants related to electric vehicles as the government wants to develop its EV sector using the country\u2019s rich nickel resources. The tech tycoon is scheduled to meet Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Monday, where he will also address the World Water Forum taking place on the island. Communications Minister Budi Arie Setiadi, who also attended the Bali launch, said Starlink was now available commercially, but the government would focus its services first for outer and underdeveloped regions. Prior to Sunday\u2019s launch, Starlink\u00a0obtained a permit\u00a0to operate as an internet service provider for retail consumers and had been given the go-ahead to provide networks, having received a very small aperture terminal (VSAT) permit, Budi\u00a0Setiadi told\u00a0Reuters. SpaceX\u2019s Starlink, which owns around 60% of the roughly 7,500 satellites orbiting earth, is dominant in the satellite internet sphere. Indonesia is the third country in Southeast Asia where Starlink will operate.

On Sunday, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said it was launching an anti-dumping probe into polyoxymethylene or POM copolymers, a thermoplastic used in various industries ranging from auto parts to electronics, imported from the US, the European Union, Taiwan and Japan. Thermoplastics are malleable when heated but become fixed in a solid shape when cooled, and can partially replace metals such as copper and zinc. The investigation should take a year to complete, but may be extended by another six months, the ministry added.

{"id": "2024_05_22_investing_graceland-foreclosure-hearing", "text": "Graceland can stay in the hands of Elvis Presley\u2019s family for the time being, after a Tennessee court chancellor ruled Wednesday that a mysterious company trying to sell it likely committed fraud. Chancellor JoeDae Jenkins said that a planned foreclosure sale of Graceland, Elvis Presley\u2019s historic Memphis home, would be postponed at least until a future hearing determines who maintains rightful ownership of the estate. A bizarre series of events set the late singer\u2019s granddaughter against a mysterious company that claimed Elvis\u2019 daughter gave it Graceland\u2019s deed. A hearing in the Shelby County, Tennessee, Chancery Court determined that Thursday\u2019s planned foreclosure auction of Graceland would irreparably harm Elvis\u2019 granddaughter, Danielle Riley Keough, who sued to block the sale. Keough took ownership of the estate and popular tourist attraction after her mother and Elvis\u2019 daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, died in January 2023. \u201cThe estate is considered unique under Tennessee law, and in being unique the loss of the real estate will be considered irreparable harm,\u201d Jenkins said. Jenkins also said there was evidence that a company trying to foreclose on Graceland had forged documents that it claimed gave it the right to sell the property. After the hearing, a person who said he represented the company trying to foreclose said it would drop its claim. In a statement, Graceland said the property will continue to operate. \u201cAs the court has now made clear, there was no validity to the claims,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThere will be no foreclosure.\u00a0\u00a0Graceland will continue to operate as it has for the past 42 years, ensuring that Elvis fans from around the world can continue to have a best in class experience when visiting his iconic home.\u201d Who holds the rights to Graceland? A company called Naussany Investments & Private Lending LLC had claimed that Lisa Marie Presley failed to pay back a $3.8 million loan it had given her \u2013 and Naussany said Presley had put up Graceland as collateral against the loan. Seeking repayment, it had scheduled an auction of the estate. This was no typical foreclosure sale. Keough filed a lawsuit earlier this month, claiming there was no such loan. She also claims\u00a0Naussany isn\u2019t even a real company. \u201cThese documents are fraudulent,\u201d Keough\u2019s lawsuit alleges. \u201cLisa Marie Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments.\u201d The lawsuit alleges Naussany Investments & Private Lending LLC \u201cappears to be a false entity created for the purpose of defrauding.\u201d Although Naussany provided what appears to be a 2018 notarized promissory note signed by Lisa Marie Presley to put up Graceland as collateral, Keough\u2019s lawsuit said that was a forgery. In a signed affidavit, the notary public denied ever notarizing anything that Lisa Marie Presley had signed. Chancellor Jenkins said that affidavit was sufficient evidence to delay the foreclosure until a hearing can determine the facts. But Jenkins also said the evidence suggested Keough was telling the truth. \u201cIt appears you\u2019ll be successful on the merits \u2026 provided you prove at the ultimate hearing fraud alleged by your client and the notary,\u201d Jenkins said Wednesday. Naussany said it is not going to proceed with its claim and \u201cwill be withdrawing all claims with prejudice,\u201d according to a statement released\u00a0today\u00a0by a person\u00a0identified as a representative of\u00a0Naussany Investments & Private Lending LLC, the company accused of trying to fraudulently foreclose on the historic property. \u201cDue to the Deed of Trust not being recorded and the loan being obtained in different state, legal action would have to be filed in multiple states and Naussany Investments & Private Lending will not acquire to proceed,\u201d the company said.. \u201cThat comes from consultation of the lawyers for the company. There was no harm meant on Ms. Keough for her mothers LMP mis habits and mis managing of money.\u201d Elvis Presley Enterprises, the company that manages Presley\u2019s estate, concurred that Naussany\u2019s claim was illegitimate. \u201cElvis Presley Enterprises can confirm that these claims are fraudulent,\u201d the company said. \u201cThere is no foreclosure sale. Simply put, the counter lawsuit has been filed is to stop the fraud.\u201d A judge last week granted a temporary restraining order, preventing Naussany from selling Graceland. Jenkins extended that order Wednesday. An estate in dispute Following Lisa Marie Presley\u2019s death, Keogh and her grandmother, Priscilla Presley, fought over the rights to her estate \u2013 including Graceland. Ultimately, Keough and Presley settled, and Keough became Graceland\u2019s sole owner. In 2004, Lisa Marie Presley sold 85% of Elvis Presley Enterprises\u2019 assets in a\u00a0deal reportedly worth more than $100 million. But she maintained complete ownership of the\u00a0Graceland mansion and Elvis\u2019 personal items housed in what is now the Graceland museum, according to the Graceland website. Graceland is one of the South\u2019s biggest tourist draws, visited by hundreds of thousands of people each year, Graceland says on its website. Lisa Marie Presley annually earned seven figures from it, based on a court filing in her 2022 divorce. Who is Riley Keough? Keough was born to parents Lisa Marie Presley and musician Danny Keough in 1989. She is a well-known actor, appearing in \u201cMad Max Fury Road\u201d and other Hollywood hits. She also appears in Hulu\u2019s \u201cUnder the Bridge.\u201d First credited as an actor in the movie the Runaways in 2010, Keough has racked up a number of acting roles. She recently starred in \u201cDaisy Jones & The Six,\u201d where she played a troubled musician in a band about to make it big. In a piece for Vanity Fair, Keough revealed she has a daughter, Tupelo Storm Smith-Petersen, who was born via surrogate in August 2022. Elvis was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, in 1935, but Keough said the name is a tribute to her late brother, Benjamin Storm Keough, who died in 2020 at the age of 27.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/investing/graceland-foreclosure-hearing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Americans might be noticing markdowns for some everyday essentials during their weekly grocery runs. That doesn\u2019t mean the battle against inflation is won. Walmart saw first-quarter sales at stores open at least a year climb 3.8% from the prior year, in part thanks to its ability to keep prices low even as inflation remains sticky. The largest retailer in the United States has been a mainstay for cash-strapped consumers shopping for deals on groceries and other merchandise. Now Walmart is taking things one step further. The superstore said on May 16 that it has rolled back prices on nearly 7,000 items in its stores, noting deflationary trends in general merchandise. Inflation during the first quarter increased at half the rate seen last year, it added. \u201cOur combination of everyday low prices plus a large number of rollbacks is resonating\u201d with consumers, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on a call with analysts. On Monday, Target slashed prices on more than 1,500 items, ranging from laundry detergent to cat food to sunscreen, with thousands more price cuts expected over the summer. For example, the price of a pack of 16 Huggies baby wipes fell to 99 cents from $1.19 and roasted nuts from the Good & Gather brand now cost $5.29 from $6.89, according to a press release. The company on Wednesday reported its fourth consecutive quarter of sales declines at stores open for at least one year as higher prices strain Target\u2019s core middle-class customer base. Other retailers including Ikea and Aldi have also reduced prices in recent months. Some economists say that while price cuts from retailers are a welcome sign that inflation overall has come down, inflation in other areas also needs to ebb to reach the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. Price cuts at big box retailers are \u201cgoing to be helpful, but we\u2019re still going to have to see housing inflation come down, which is an issue, and wage growth continue to normalize,\u201d said Preston Caldwell, senior US economist at Morningstar Research Services. The median price of a previously owned home in the United States grew 5.7% in April from a year earlier to $407,600, the highest April price on record. Wage gains slowed last month but are still above historical averages. The Fed\u2019s progress on tamping down inflation stalled during the first quarter of this year, raising concerns that the central bank won\u2019t cut rates until this fall or even next year. Unemployment remains at historic lows, worrying some that the Fed will want to see the job market cool further before deciding to ease its restrictive policy. Still, recent data has suggested that inflation is cooling again. Consumer prices rose 3.4% for the 12 months ended in April, easing from 3.5% the month before, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Investors will get more inflation data next week from the Personal Consumption Expenditures index for April. The economy is also showing signs of cooling. Americans are falling behind on their payments, running down their pandemic savings and becoming more frugal. Retail sales were unchanged last month from March, when spending increased by a downwardly revised 0.6%, in another sign that consumers are dialing down their spending. Why OpenAI should fear a Scarlett Johansson lawsuit Will Scarlett Johansson sue OpenAI for creating a voice assistant that sounds like the actor\u2019s performance in the 2013 film \u201cHer,\u201d about a man who falls in love with an artificial intelligence? That\u2019s how things could go after Johansson said OpenAI tried to hire her to voice an AI assistant for ChatGPT and, when she refused, forged ahead with a sound-alike voice. OpenAI\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Sam Altman, could be directly in the crosshairs of such a lawsuit, writes my colleague Brian Fung. Now, legal experts say Johansson may have a powerful and credible claim in court if she does decide to sue, pointing to a long string of past cases that could lead to significant damages for one of the world\u2019s leading AI companies and raise questions about the industry\u2019s readiness to deal with AI\u2019s many messy complications. That OpenAI was apparently unaware of that legal history, or at worst willfully ignorant of it, highlights what some critics say is a lack of industry oversight in AI and a need for greater protections for creators. OpenAI didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. There are two types of law that could potentially be involved here, according to legal experts, but only one is likely to come into play based on the currently known facts. Read more here. Citi just got the bill for its $189 billion trading near miss UK regulators slapped a combined \u00a362 million ($79 million) fine on Citigroup Wednesday for failures in its trading systems that almost resulted in stocks worth $189 billion being dumped onto European markets, reports my colleague Anna Cooban. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) imposed a fine of nearly \u00a328 million ($36 million) on Citigroup (C), while the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority fined it almost \u00a334 million ($43 million) following investigations into the US bank, according to statements from the authorities.

{"id": "2024_05_22_business_dupont-de-nemours-company-split", "text": "DuPont de Nemours, the American multinational chemical company that traces its history back to 1802, announced plans to split into three publicly traded companies on Wednesday. The company plans to spin off its electronics and water businesses into their own yet-to-be-named companies in a transaction that is tax-free to shareholders. DuPont said it expects to complete the breakup transactions within the next 18 to 24 months, and it is subject to final approval by DuPont\u2019s board of directors. The announcement also included a shakeup in leadership: Effective June 1, DuPont\u2019s chief financial officer, Lori Koch, will step into the CEO role. DuPont\u2019s current CEO, Ed Breen, will stay on as executive chairman. Koch will remain CEO of the new, slimmed-down DuPont once the spin-offs are complete, according to the company. Shares of DuPont were slightly higher in Thursday morning trading, rising by around 1.5% after the opening bell. DuPont\u2019s breakup comes amid other large, multinational companies announcing breakups in recent years, with many CEOs and corporate boards touting the agility of smaller companies. In a statement, Breen echoed a similar refrain, saying the three smaller companies would have greater flexibility after the spin-off. \u201cThe three-way separation will unlock incremental value for shareholders and customers and also create new opportunities for employees,\u201d he said. \u201cCritically, each company will have greater flexibility to pursue their own focused growth strategies, including portfolio enhancing M&A (mergers and acquisitions).\u201d In the last several years, major American companies like J&J, Kellogg and General Electric announced company break-ups and spin-offs, signaling a preference for smaller, more nimble companies over the conglomerates that gained prominence in previous decades. This is the second DuPont breakup in half a decade. In 2019, DowDuPont, which was created in a DuPont merger with Dow Chemical, broke apart into three separate entities: DuPont, Dow Chemical and Corteva, the company\u2019s agriculture business. On Wednesday, DuPont said the newly formed electronics company would focus on \u201csemiconductor solutions and advanced electronics products,\u201d while the new water company would be \u201ca comprehensive water solutions provider.\u201d The leftover divisions will remain as part of DuPont.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/business/dupont-de-nemours-company-split/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

Margrethe Vestager, the EU\u2019s competition chief, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0Thursday that Mondelez had illegally limited cross-border sales within the EU to maintain higher prices for its products. \u201cThis case is about the price of groceries. It\u2019s a key concern to European citizens and even more obviously in times of very high inflation, where many are in a cost-of-living crisis,\u201d she added during a press conference. The European Commission, which started looking into the case in 2019, found that Mondelez\u00a0International (MDLZ)\u00a0had deliberately restricted cross-border trade and abused \u201cits dominant position\u201d in some national markets for the sale of chocolate bars. It launched a formal investigation in 2021. Among other things, the company had ceased supplying chocolate bars\u00a0in the Netherlands to prevent them from being imported into Belgium, where Mondelez was selling the same products at higher prices, the EU\u2019s executive arm said in the statement. \u201cThe commission concluded that Mondelez\u2019s illegal practices\u00a0prevented retailers from being able to freely source products in (EU) member states with lower prices,\u201d it added. A spokesperson for Mondelez International said the penalty related to \u201cisolated incidents, most of which ceased or were remedied well in advance of the commission\u2019s investigation.\u201d \u201cThis historical matter is not representative of who we are and the strong culture of compliance for which we strive \u2026 This is why we will continue to place emphasis on our overall compliance culture and have strengthened our annual mandatory compliance program to reflect learnings,\u201d the spokesperson added. Mondelez made an accrual for the fine last year and no further measures will be necessary to finance it. According to the EU, the company\u2019s illegal practices date as far back as 2006 and include refusing to supply a wholesaler in Germany in order to prevent the resale of chocolate bars in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria and Romania where prices were higher. In another case, Mondelez required a customer to charge higher prices for exports compared with domestic sales. This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_05_23_media_washington-post-will-lewis-turnaround-plan", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. On Wednesday,\u00a0Will Lewis, the newly minted publisher and chief executive of\u00a0The Washington Post, strode on stage before gathered staffers at the company\u2019s D.C. headquarters to outline his vision for shepherding the iconic newspaper into a financially prosperous future. Dressed in a navy blue blazer and button down shirt, along with his trademark sneakers (the Brit is known to be partial to the casual footwear), Lewis first delivered the cold hard reality to his assembled workforce. He candidly explained the depths of The Post\u2019s recent financial woes, revealing that it had lost $77 million over the last year and seen a dramatic 50% drop in audience since the highs of 2020. \u201cTo speak candidly,\u201d Lewis told staffers at the top of the 90-minute meeting, \u201cwe are in a hole, and we have been for some time.\u201d But Lewis said he has a plan to rescue the renowned newspaper that has broken some of the biggest stories of our time and turned its most influential journalists into household names. That plan, officially dubbed the \u201cbuild it\u201d phase of the turnaround project (which follows the \u201csay it\u201d and \u201cfix it\u201d phases), was defined by a pyramid shared with staffers in a Powerpoint presentation. The pyramid, aimed at helping employees visualize new business opportunities, showed the traditional subscription membership stacked along with new subscription and payment offerings for readers. Among the new revenue streams are \u201cflexible payments,\u201d which were described to staffers as \u201cfrictionless payments\u201d that would target a \u201clikely untapped\u201d audience. In other words, a person who may be interested in reading a single story on The Post\u2019s website will soon be able to make that one-time purchase via a service like\u00a0Apple Pay. I\u2019m told that feature will, in fact, start to roll out next quarter. Additional subscription tiers, dubbed Post Pro and Post Plus, are also in the works, targeting working professionals and diehard readers with additional products, including a forthcoming newsletter focused on the climate and economy. The plan follows similar premium subscription offerings from the likes of\u00a0Axios\u00a0and\u00a0POLITICO, which\u00a0have introduced \u201cpro\u201d plans that have helped tap into new revenue streams. \u201cWe think that we\u2019ve been a one-size-fits-all organization for too long, so we\u2019re excited to create a new set of consumer and professional products that better meets the needs of our multi-faceted audiences,\u201d\u00a0Karl Wells, chief growth officer at The Post, explained. Lewis\u2019 plan, however, included more than just revamping The Post\u2019s subscription offerings. Silicon Valley veteran\u00a0Vineet Khosla, the newspaper\u2019s chief technology officer, appeared onstage, speaking to staffers about the need to integrate artificial intelligence into The Post\u2019s newsroom. \u201cI totally get that there is a huge fear of A.I. everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I want us to go beyond the fear. The way I see us operate is we have A.I. everywhere. We have A.I. in our newsroom; we have A.I. with our consumers; we have A.I. in the business\u2026 Start thinking of it as a copilot.\u201d The experimentation with machine language models is already underway. The Post has started using A.I.-generated voices to allow people to listen to select newsletters. And, last week, Executive Editor\u00a0Sally Buzbee\u00a0announced in an internal memo an expanded version of article takeaways, which will be generated by A.I. and edited by humans in the newsroom. At the same time,\u00a0Kathy Baird, The Post\u2019s chief communications officer, told staffers at the Wednesday meeting that the newspaper plans to strengthen audience relationships with its journalists, aiming to promote key journalists that create its reporting and connect them with readers. While The Post clearly plans to bet big on infusing its products with A.I., it wants to emphasize the human element of its journalism. Whether the multi-pronged initiative is enough to turn The Post around, of course, remains to be seen. It goes without saying that Lewis and the newspaper\u2019s leadership team have their work cut out for them, as evidenced by the poor state of affairs that Lewis himself disclosed to staffers. But the new publisher voiced confidence that these measures will put The Post on track for success. \u201cI really hope at some point in the future, when you look back on this day,\u201d he told staffers, \u201cit\u2019s actually quite a significant day in the history of our company.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/media/washington-post-will-lewis-turnaround-plan/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_business_what-went-wrong-at-red-lobster", "text": "Last summer, Red Lobster made $20 endless shrimp a permanent menu item. Endless shrimp was a successful annual limited-time offer for Red Lobster for 20 years. But Red Lobster\u2019s latest major shareholder, Thai Union, a Bangkok-based canned seafood company, saw the promotion as a way to sell off the mountains of shrimp it was catching and turned it into an everyday item. (Thai Union became Red Lobster\u2019s largest investor in 2020.) The change cost Red Lobster $11 million. Red Lobster filed for bankruptcy Sunday, and the bankruptcy filing sheds new light on Thai Union\u2019s role in the endless shrimp mishap. Red Lobster said it is investigating the circumstances of that promotion, which Red Lobster management opposed. Under a CEO appointed at the direction of Thai Union, Red Lobster eliminated two of its breaded shrimp suppliers, leaving Thai Union with an exclusive deal to provide shrimp for the chain, the filing said. That led to higher costs, and it did not comply with the company\u2019s typical decision-making process for picking suppliers based on projected demand, according to the chain\u2019s filing. \u201cThis decision created both operational and financial issues for [Red Lobster]\u2026 saddling the company with burdensome supply obligations\u201d to Thai Union, Red Lobster said in the filing. Thai Union did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Endless shrimp alone didn\u2019t doom Red Lobster. The American poster child for seafood was dragged down by a range of factors, say former leaders at the chain and restaurant analysts \u2014 including handoffs between a mix of investors and corporate parents and Thai Union\u2019s mismanagement. \u201cCertain operational decisions by former management have harmed [Red Lobster\u2019s] financial situation in recent years,\u201d Red Lobster said in its bankruptcy filing. The explosive growth and popularity of fast-casual chains like Chipotle and quick-service chains like Chick-fil-A over the past two decades also squeezed Red Lobster. And years of underinvestment in Red Lobster\u2019s marketing, food quality, service and restaurant upgrades hurt the chain\u2019s ability to add Millennials to its core Baby Boomer customer base. \u201cRed Lobster was the foundation of casual dining. They had a position of power and prominence and revolutionized how American consumers eat seafood,\u201d said Alex Susskind, a professor of food and beverage management at Cornell University, in a previous interview with CNN. But the company didn\u2019t build on that foundation, Susskind said. \u201cRed Lobster had incredible popularity among Baby Boomers. They didn\u2019t bring in a newer generation.\u201d Owned by General Mills When the first Red Lobster opened in 1968 in Lakeland, Florida, an hour south of Orlando, casual dining was in its infancy. The brand was started by southern restaurateurs Bill Darden and Charley Woodsby. Darden owned several Howard Johnson\u2019s restaurants, one of the first casual dining concepts. \u201cOur motto was informal and family prices,\u201d Woodsby\u00a0later said. They saw an opportunity to bring seafood to landlocked people at more affordable prices than fine-dining restaurants. \u201cIn most of middle America, you couldn\u2019t get decent seafood. Red Lobster brought it to the masses,\u201d said Jonathan Maze, the editor in chief at Restaurant Business Magazine, a trade publication. \u201cRed Lobster was part of this casual dining revolution.\u201d Just two years into Darden and Woodsby\u2019s venture, General Mills acquired the brand. General Mills owned brands like Wheaties, Cheerios and Betty Crocker, and the company wanted to enter the restaurant industry with Red Lobster\u2019s five no-frills restaurants. By the early 1970s, with General Mills\u2019 advertising muscle behind it, Red Lobster opened restaurants across the South. Red Lobster rose quickly and was the first casual dining chain to advertise on network television, according to a Harvard Business School\u00a0study. Red Lobster also developed the first national seafood distribution system in the 1970s. \u201cMany diners preferred their seafood fried in those days, and Red Lobster\u2019s hush puppies could be considered an early \u2018signature item,\u2019\u201d Joe Lee, the first general manager at Red Lobster and later its president, said in a journal\u00a0article. \u201cFamilies were welcomed with high chairs and a 59-cent child\u2019s plate.\u201d By 1978, Red Lobster had 236 restaurants and $291 million in sales. It had 372 restaurants and $834 million in sales in 1985. In 1995, General Mills spun off its restaurant division into a new company, Darden Restaurants, named for Red Lobster founder Bill Darden. The company initially included the legacy Red Lobster chain and Olive Garden, an upstart chain General Mills had started in 1982. Red Lobster stalls But Red Lobster fell behind its sister brand Olive Garden under Darden. By 2008, Olive Garden\u2019s sales had eclipsed Red Lobster\u2019s. Darden also acquired fast-growing chains such as Longhorn Steakhouse, Capital Grille and Yard House. \u201cDarden stopped investing in Red Lobster. Things slowly deteriorated,\u201d Les Foreman, a director of operations and divisional vice president at Red Lobster from 2002 to 2022, told CNN. Red Lobster\u2019s sales began declining and Darden prioritized investments in its other brands. Darden soon faced pressure from activist investors pushing the company to split in two. Darden responded to activist pressure by announcing plans in 2013 to\u00a0sell Red Lobster, separating the chain from the rest of its business. The following year, Darden\u00a0sold Red Lobster\u00a0to Golden Gate Capital, a private equity firm, for $2.1 billion. To help fund the deal, Red Lobster spun off its real estate assets in a transaction known as a sale leaseback agreement. Red Lobster had long owned its own real estate but would now be paying rent to lease its restaurants. Sale leasebacks are very common in the restaurant industry, but the arrangement wound up hurting Red Lobster because it became stuck with leases it no longer could afford to pay. \u201cThat produced cost pressures on Red Lobster that they\u2019ve never had before,\u201d said analyst John Gordon. \u201cIt became a problem.\u201d At the same time, fast-casual and quick-service restaurants grew with lower prices, thousands of new drive-thru locations and online delivery. These chains pressured the casual dining sector. Casual dining has slipped from 36% of total restaurant industry sales in 2013 to 31% in 2023, according to Technomic, a restaurant research firm. \u2018Cutting costs everywhere\u2019 Red Lobster\u2019s controlling shareholder Thai Union also hurt the brand, say former employees and analysts. Thai Union was a top supplier of shrimp to Red Lobster for more than 20 years. In 2016, Thai Union took a $575 million minority stake in the brand. In 2020, Thai Union deepened its financial interest in Red Lobster. Thai Union saw an opportunity to grow its business and also become a bigger supplier to Red Lobster. It also tested squeezing Red Lobster\u2019s waitstaff to the breaking point to save on labor costs, switching from waiters covering three tables to 10. Red Lobster executives began to run for the doors under Thai Union\u2019s management, resulting in a huge amount of C-suite churn. In 2021 and 2022, Red Lobster brought on a new CEO, chief marketing officer, chief financial officer and chief information officer. All left the company within two years. Then came the all-you-can-eat shrimp mishap last year. \u201cWe were expecting an increase of 20% in customer traffic, but the actual number was up to 40%,\u201d Thai Union CEO Thiraphong Chansiri said in November. Two months later, Thai Union said it would divest from Red Lobster and take a $530 million loss on its investment. The company blamed the pandemic, as well as \u201csustained industry headwinds, higher interest rates and rising material and labor costs.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to stop eating lobster,\u201d Chansiri said this year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/business/what-went-wrong-at-red-lobster/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_economy_fdic-chair-gruenberg-resigns", "text": "Martin Gruenberg, head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, will step down following a scathing independent investigation detailing pervasive sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying at the agency charged with regulating the banking sector. \u201cIn light of recent events, I am prepared to step down from my responsibilities once a successor is confirmed,\u201d Gruenberg said in a statement on Monday. \u201cUntil that time, I will continue to fulfill my responsibilities as Chairman of the FDIC, including the transformation of the FDIC\u2019s workplace culture.\u201d Gruenberg\u2019s announcement of his intent to resign comes hours after Sen. Sherrod Brown, a top Democrat who leads the Senate Banking Committee, called for \u201cnew leadership\u201d at the FDIC. \ufeffGruenberg joined the FDIC board of directors almost two decades ago. He\u2019s served as chair of the agency for nearly 10 of the past 13 years. President Joe Biden will \u201csoon\u201d announce a new nominee to lead the FDIC, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sam Michel said in a statement on Monday following the news. \u201cWe expect the Senate to confirm the nominee quickly,\u201d he added. However, there\u2019s no guarantee that will happen, since confirmation processes have been known to drag on for months or longer, at which point Biden may no longer be in office. With Gruenberg remaining\u00a0until a successor is named,\u00a0there won\u2019t be\u00a0a situation where Vice Chair Travis Hill, a Republican appointee, automatically becomes chair, leaving the agency deadlocked with one other Republican and two Democratic members on the FDIC\u2019s board of directors. That would have likely stalled significant and controversial banking regulations, such as ramped-up capital requirements, from taking effect. Michel said the administration is grateful for \u201chis willingness to stay at FDIC until his successor is confirmed in order to continue to safeguard our nation\u2019s financial stability during this time of transition.\u201d Sen. Tim Scott, the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, slammed Gruenberg\u2019s decision not to resign immediately as well as Democrats for not putting more pressure on him to do so. \u201cThis draw-it-out strategy makes it clear that this administration is prioritizing their political agenda over protecting workers,\u201d Scott said in a statement. The FDIC commissioned a report by law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, which ultimately spurred Gruenberg\u2019s resignation. It confirmed the findings of a November Wall Street Journal investigation revealing a long-standing problematic culture. It did not find that Gruenberg alone was responsible for the issues described in depth in the report based on interviews with over 500 employees. However, it documented several instances where Gruenberg lashed out at subordinates \u201cparticularly when being delivered bad news or conveyed views with which he disagrees.\u201d That caused staffers to delay delivering news they feared would upset him. Gruenberg\u2019s temperament \u201cmay hinder his ability to establish trust and confidence in leading meaningful culture change,\u201d the report added. Gruenberg testified before lawmakers last week in a previously scheduled hearing with other top financial regulators, saying he takes \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the findings of the report. \u201cI also acknowledge my own failures as Chairman, both in failing to recognize how my temperament in meetings impacted others and for not having identified deeper cultural issues at the FDIC sooner,\u201d he said. The FDIC declined to comment beyond Gruenberg\u2019s statement on Monday. A tricky political manuever While most Democrats stopped short of calling for Gruenberg to resign or be replaced, many expressed outrage at the mid-May hearings in the House and Senate that Gruenberg testified at. \u201cI\u2019m pissed off\u2026 If it was me in my office, I\u2019d probably be run out,\u201d said Rep. Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat during the hearing. \u201cIt just saddens me greatly,\u201d he added, referring to the findings of the independent report. However, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren labeled the calls Gruenberg received to resign \u201cpurely political exercise.\u201d \u201cYour resignation would do nothing to improve the culture of the FDIC but it would give Republicans a veto over bank policy,\u201d she said at the Senate hearing where Gruenberg testified. For her, it appeared it would be sufficient for him to see through implementing all the recommendations of the report, which he said he would.

{"id": "2024_05_20_success_income-producing-portfolio-passive-income", "text": "If you have savings and investments to support you in retirement \u2014 or, before then, if you take an unpaid leave from your job \u2014 you can put that money to work in ways that help cover your short-term income needs without sacrificing your long-term security. How much income you can generate depends on several factors, including how big your nest egg is, how it\u2019s invested, where interest rates go and your risk tolerance. A lot goes into creating and managing an income-producing portfolio that works for you. But here are some basics to consider. Three questions to answer Ideally, you want to begin planning three to five years ahead of when you plan to draw income from your portfolio. Start by asking: How do I want to occupy my time when I leave my job? Will you still do paid work, just not put in as many hours? Do you want to travel a lot? Go back to school? Build an eco-friendly home? Whatever your choices, the more specific you can be, the easier it will be to assess your actual income needs when the time comes, said certified financial planner David Seufer, founder of Gravitas Wealth Planning. What fixed sources of income will I have? That is, steady payments that won\u2019t fluctuate. Social Security benefits are the most typical example. (You can get an estimate specific to your earnings history here.) If you\u2019ll get a pension, count that too. How much will I spend? Knowing your expenses will give you a good sense of the income you\u2019ll need. Marguerita Cheng, a certified financial planner and founder of Blue Ocean Global Wealth, asks her clients to write down what they consider to be their \u201ccore and essential\u201d expenses \u2014 she doesn\u2019t call them \u201cfixed,\u201d because some are not, like your energy bill, which can be seasonal. She also asks them to write about their \u201cvariable or lifestyle\u201d expenses, which reflect what you do regularly that is important to you. If there are new expenses you will incur based on your plans, add those in. Or if you plan to move, account for how your living expenses may change. Ways to generate income Take the income you think you\u2019ll need and subtract from that the income you expect. For example, if you need $65,000 a year but will only bring in $40,000, you\u2019ll need to generate the other $25,000. There are several ways savings and investments can do that, or at least cover part of that shortfall. Among the most common is interest from high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, Treasury bills and government and corporate bonds. Dividend are another income source. But you don\u2019t just want dividend-paying equities in your portfolio. \u201cWhen one invests only in stocks that pay dividends or that only pay the highest dividends, one may miss out on the capital appreciation potential of stocks that pay no dividend at all or much lower dividend rates,\u201d said David Edmisten, a certified financial planner and founder of Next Phase Financial Planning. Instead, Edmisten recommends having both growth stocks and dividend-paying stocks. That way, he said \u201c[you] collect dividends for income, but also generate capital appreciation to help combat inflation.\u201d Capital gains, which result from selling an asset for more than you bought it, are another income source. Keep in mind you don\u2019t need to buy individual stocks and bonds. You can get exposure to both through low-cost mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Setting up an income-producing portfolio You want to have enough cash to support you in the near term \u2014 and to protect you from having to sell assets at a loss in market downturns. But you also need long-term growth in your portfolio because, even when you retire, you may live for 25 or more years. Edmisten recommends using a bucket strategy: \u2022 Keep 18 to 24 months of expenses in cash or cash-equivalents, which include high-yield savings accounts, short-term CDs and Treasury bills. \u2022 For money you\u2019ll need in three to five years, use short-term corporate bonds as well as longer-term CDs. \u2022 For years six through 10, have a mix of stocks and longer-term bonds. \u2022 And for years 11 and up, your money should just be in stocks. Replenishing your cash reserve If your cash reserves are running down faster than you expect, you can replenish them in several ways. You can stop reinvesting some of your dividends and instead take the cash payout. You can take some capital gains off the table and rebalance your portfolio, Cheng said. Say your plan allocates 20% of your portfolio to a given asset class (e.g., large-cap growth stocks) and it grows to 25%. You can sell shares equal to that 5% difference and put the money into your cash accounts. Or, if you don\u2019t have a lot of gains, you might liquidate some of your bonds in your three-to-five-year bucket so you don\u2019t have to sell long-term growth assets, Edmisten said. Another option: If you or your spouse are still working and maxing out contributions to a workplace retirement savings plan or IRA, you might temporarily reduce them. To reduce your cash needs, you also might look to see what expenses you can trim. The biggest costs for many people are housing, transportation and health care, Cheng said. Diversify and mind the tax consequences Having a diversified income stream gives you flexibility to pull from one type of investment over another when it\u2019s most advantageous to do so. Beyond dividend-paying stocks, bonds and interest-bearing instruments, some people  may want annuities to be part of their income stream. You can purchase them in exchange for the guarantee of a steady paycheck over a given number of years. \u201cAnnuities can make sense in certain situations \u2014 with clients who are a little risk averse \u2026 especially if they don\u2019t have a pension or other sources of guaranteed income,\u201d Seufer said. But annuities are complex. They can be expensive and give you less flexibility to make changes if your life changes. So be informed. \u201cUnderstand the contract. And understand what the limitations are,\u201d Edmisten said. You also will want some flexibility to time which accounts to draw from, based on their tax consequences, Seufer said. For example, a pre-tax 401(k), a taxable brokerage account and tax-free money in a Roth IRA offer a good mix of options. Similarly, some investments generate tax-free income at the federal or state level, such as Treasury bills and municipal bonds. Get help with what you need You may feel fine managing everything on your own. If not, you may want to pay a flat fee to a fee-only certified financial planner to provide a roadmap for how to set things up and to offer periodic guidance throughout the year. Or you may be interested in letting a CFP not only come up with a plan but directly manage your investments, too, if they\u2019re qualified. Tell the planner what you want. It could be guidance on cash flow management, taxes or optimizing when you and your spouse should take Social Security. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be direct about where you think you need help,\u201d Cheng said. And if you do decide to let a firm manage your nest egg, ideally you don\u2019t want to pay more than 1% of your assets a year for that service, she suggested.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/success/income-producing-portfolio-passive-income/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world.

While speaking remotely via webcam at VivaTech 2024 in Paris, Musk described a future where jobs would be \u201coptional.\u201d \u201cIf you want to do a job that\u2019s kinda like a hobby, you can do a job,\u201d Musk said. \u201cBut otherwise, AI and the robots will provide any goods and services that you want.\u201d For this scenario to work, he said, there would need to be \u201cuniversal high income\u201d \u2013 not to be confused with universal basic income, although he did not share what that could look like. (UBI refers to the government giving a certain amount of money to everyone regardless of how much they earn.) \u201cThere would be no shortage of goods or services,\u201d he said. AI capabilities have surged over the past few years, fast enough that regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use the technology responsibly. Concerns also continue to mount over how various industries and jobs will change as AI proliferates in the market. In January, researchers at MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab found workplaces are adopting AI much more slowly than some had expected and feared. The report also said the majority of jobs previously identified as vulnerable to AI were not economically beneficial for employers to automate at that time. Experts also largely believe that many jobs that require a high emotional intelligence and human interaction will not need replacing, such as mental health professionals, creatives and teachers. Musk has been outspoken about his concerns around AI. During the keynote on Thursday, he called the technology his biggest fear. He cited the \u201cCulture Book Series\u201d by Ian Banks, a utopian fictionalized look at a society run by advanced technology, as the most realistic and \u201cthe best envisioning of a future AI.\u201d In a job-free future, though, Musk questioned whether people would feel emotionally fulfilled. \u201cThe question will really be one of meaning\u00a0 \u2013 if the computer and robots can do everything better than you, does your life have meaning?\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cI do think there\u2019s perhaps still a role for humans in this \u2013 in that we may give AI meaning.\u201d He also used his stage time to urge parents to limit the amount of social media that children can see because \u201cthey\u2019re being programmed by a dopamine-maximizing AI.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/tech/elon-musk-ai-your-job/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

A successful antritrust case could potentially lead to sweeping changes in the market for live events \u2013 an industry that came under intense scrutiny in 2022 after glitches at Ticketmaster blocked millions from purchasing tickets for Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cEras\u201d tour. For many critics of Live Nation, the Swift debacle revealed how a lack of competition has led to harms ranging from poor customer service to confusing pricing to expensive ticketing fees to restrictions on ticket resales \u2014 amounting to what many consumers complain of as death by a thousand cuts. The fiasco led lawmakers to grill a top executive of Ticketmaster\u2019s parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, in January last year over the company\u2019s practices. During the three-hour hearing, senators pressed Live Nation president and CFO Joe Berchtold and some other witnesses on whether his company was too dominant in the industry, thereby harming rivals, musicians and fans. \u201cI want to congratulate and thank you for an absolutely stunning achievement,\u201d Sen.

{"id": "2024_05_23_tech_what-the-ticketmaster-lawsuit-means-for-you", "text": "The Justice Department\u2019s massive antitrust suit against Live Nation on Thursday reflects widespread frustration among fans and concertgoers everywhere who are fed up with confusing fees, ticket restrictions and poor customer service at its Ticketmaster business, the country\u2019s biggest live event ticketing company. But the Department of Justice says those complaints are just the symptom of a more fundamental problem with Live Nation. \u201cWe\u2019re here not because Ticketmaster\u2019s conduct is inconvenient or frustrating,\u201d said Attorney General Merrick Garland at a press conference. \u201cWe\u2019re here because it\u2019s illegal.\u201d Here are four major takeaways for concertgoers from Thursday\u2019s groundbreaking suit. More competition for fans and artists According to the lawsuit filed in New York by the US government and 30 attorneys general from both political parties, Live Nation has monopolized the live events market by owning key chunks of every industry needed to put on a successful tour. That stack includes not just Ticketmaster, which sells tickets to fans, but also other parts of the value chain, including the concert promoters who work with artists to put on shows and even many of the venues where they play. Antitrust officials say Live Nation has weaponized that integration, resorting to exclusive contracts, threats and retaliation to keep competition at bay and to make sure venues and rivals stay in line. Those tactics are what allow Live Nation to charge exorbitant fees that ultimately harm the consumer and to punish artists who boycott the company, the governments say. Ticket prices won\u2019t go down The Justice Department seems to think so. Antitrust officials are pushing for a breakup of Live Nation on the theory that splitting it apart will disrupt the \u201cflywheel\u201d that allegedly lets it hold users, artists and venues hostage. Live Nation, for its part, says even if the lawsuit succeeds, it won\u2019t lead to cheaper ticket prices. \u201cCalling Ticketmaster a monopoly may be a PR win for the DOJ in the short term,\u201d the company said in a statement, \u201cbut it will lose in court because it ignores the basic economics of live entertainment.\u201d Consumer groups that have advocated for a breakup are applauding the antitrust suit. \u201cThe only way to ensure fair competition, more access, and better service for fans and artists is for the DOJ to see this lawsuit through to the end of Live Nation-Ticketmaster,\u201d said the Fan Fairness Coalition in a statement. An uncertain path forward To fix the issue, regulators say Live Nation must be broken up. Officials won\u2019t say exactly how they think a breakup should work; on a call with reporters Thursday, senior DOJ officials said they are keeping their options open while the case moves forward. If they win the lawsuit and persuade a court that Live Nation broke the law, there could likely be a separate court proceeding to determine what remedies would be appropriate. But based on past criticism of Live Nation, one possible outcome at a minimum could be a spinoff of Ticketmaster. The two companies famously merged in 2010, creating a vertically integrated behemoth. The DOJ didn\u2019t oppose the deal at the time, instead reaching an agreement with Live Nation that imposed some commitments on the combined company. Thursday\u2019s lawsuit, in a way, reflects an admission by DOJ that the deal was bad from the start and that the conditions it imposed on Live Nation haven\u2019t worked. Better customer service Complaints about Ticketmaster and Live Nation are nothing new. But Taylor Swift may have brought them to the forefront of the public\u2019s attention. Spurred on by debacles such as the 2022 Taylor Swift fiasco, in which technical glitches at Ticketmaster prevented millions of fans from buying tickets for Swift\u2019s \u201cEras\u201d tour, criticism of Live Nation and Ticketmaster have reached a fever pitch. Reacting in 2022 to the Ticketmaster fiasco that enraged her fans, Swift\u00a0wrote on Instagram\u00a0that the situation was \u201cexcruciating for me\u201d and \u201cpisses me off.\u201d For many critics of Live Nation, the Swift debacle revealed how a lack of competition has led to harms ranging from poor customer service to confusing pricing to expensive\u00a0ticketing fees\u00a0to restrictions on ticket resales \u2014 amounting to what many consumers complain of as death by a thousand cuts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/tech/what-the-ticketmaster-lawsuit-means-for-you/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_economy_fed-minutes-wall-street-inflation", "text": "Earlier this week, some officials at the Federal Reserve said they\u2019re no longer worried about inflation reaccelerating, after data showed that progress stalled in the first quarter. Optimism spurred by the latest inflation data pushed all three major stock indexes to new record highs. But now Wall Street, eager for rate cuts, is on edge again. That\u2019s because minutes from the central bank\u2019s latest policy meeting released Wednesday showed that \u201cvarious\u201d officials said they would be willing to raise interest rates if necessary and that there were doubts as to whether financial conditions are restrictive enough to keep inflation from resurging. It spooked investors: The Dow slid more than 300 points following the release of the minutes. Moreover, the Fed minutes seemed to outweigh comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller, a key messenger of monetary policy moves, who told CNBC in an interview Tuesday that the Fed could cut rates by the \u201cend of the year.\u201d In a separate speech earlier that day, he said \u201cthe data suggests that inflation isn\u2019t accelerating.\u201d \u201cMore recent data on the economy indicate that restrictive monetary policy is helping to cool off aggregate demand and the inflation data for April suggests that progress toward 2% has likely resumed,\u201d Waller said at an event hosted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He pointed to recent figures on employment and retail spending coming in weaker than expected, both of which should help take some steam out of inflation. But some financial leaders remain doubtful that the Fed is feeling confident enough to cut rates soon. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said Wednesday at an event hosted by Boston College that the Fed probably won\u2019t begin to cut rates this year. \u201cI\u2019m still at zero cuts,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re set up for stickier inflation.\u201d Some Fed officials say another rate hike isn\u2019t likely Fed officials have mostly sounded a little more optimistic about inflation recently, after the Consumer Price Index for April finally provided some welcome news. The inflation report was mostly in line with expectations, which was an improvement from the disappointing figures for the first three months of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to focus too much on just one data point,\u201d said Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson at an event hosted by the Mortgage Bankers Association on Monday. However, he noted that the April CPI data was nonetheless \u201ca good sign for us.\u201d San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told Axios in an interview that published Monday that she doesn\u2019t \u201csee any evidence right now that we need to adjust upwards.\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month that it may just be a matter of giving high interest rates some time to kick in. \u201cWhat that has told us is that we\u2019ll need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work,\u201d he said during a moderated discussion with European Central Bank Governing Council member Klaas Knot. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester told Bloomberg on Monday that she also thinks interest rates are high enough to deal with inflation. But despite the hopeful Fedspeak on inflation, there is still an uneasiness in the air about what\u2019s really happening and what the central bank will do. \u201cFor now, the Fed says it wants to see more evidence that inflation is easing, which implies higher-for-longer rates until that data materializes,\u201d wrote Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing for E*TRADE in a note Wednesday. \u201cTraders will have to wait until next week\u2019s PCE price index to get another read on inflation and update their expectations for rate cuts,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_business_nvidias-stock-split-earnings-results", "text": "Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split on Wednesday, making buying shares in the red-hot semiconductor company more accessible for individual investors. Five years ago, an investor could have purchased Nvidia stock for less than $50 a share. But since then, the stock has exploded more than 2,500%. A single share in the company was worth $949.50 as of Wednesday\u2019s close. Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) announcement, which came in its quarterly earnings report, means that each common share will be split into 10 smaller shares, effectively cutting the price of investing in the company. The company posted yet another quarter of strong financial results on Wednesday, as well. Nvidia reported a 262% increase in revenue and a 462% increase in profits year-over-year. Nvidia\u2019s post-split shares will begin trading at the market open on June 10, coming at a time when Nvidia\u2019s stock has been on a tear, fueled by investor enthusiasm about the company\u2019s role in artificial intelligence. Nvidia shares rose as much as 4% in after-hours trading following the report. Nvidia is crucial to the burgeoning AI space. The American chipmaker is unmatched in producing processors that power artificial intelligence systems, including for generative AI, the buzzy new technology that can create text, images and other media.  And the company\u2019s soaring stock price over the past year means Nvidia is now deeply important to the broader market, too. The company has become something of a bellwether for the larger AI boom that has been driving the recent market rally. That the company was again able to exceed Wall Street\u2019s predications for its booming sales growth on Wednesday isn\u2019t entirely surprising. Many of the major tech giants, including Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and others, have announced in recent weeks that they\u2019re continuing to pour billions of dollars into building AI infrastructure, and no company is better poised to be the beneficiary of that investment than Nvidia. Still, some investors had raised questions ahead of Wednesday\u2019s report about just how long Nvidia could keep the rally going. The company faces growing competition from in-house AI chips from Amazon and Alphabet, and it has had to contend with US restrictions on exports of advanced AI chips to China. \u201cThere was no secret around Wall Street that Nvidia\u2019s earnings would come in hot once again,\u201d Investing.com senior analyst Thomas Monteiro said in a statement following the report. \u201cWhile the company didn\u2019t repeat the same total blowout from the last few quarters in any specific area, today\u2019s numbers remain incredibly strong, leaving no doubt that the company\u2019s leadership in the AI revolution remains unchallenged for now.\u201d Nvidia said it expects revenue for the current quarter to grow approximately 107% year-over-year, a slight slowdown from the meteoric sales growth the company has posted over the past few quarters as it hits the one-year mark from when the AI boom began to take off.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/business/nvidias-stock-split-earnings-results/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can \u201clisten\u201d to people\u2019s questions and converse in real time. \u201cShellie\u201d can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while \u201cArif\u201d is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_tech_microsoft-ai-tool-privacy-recall", "text": "Microsoft\u2019s buzziest new AI feature is raising concerns that it could potentially be misused in the wrong hands. This week, the company showed off a new tool called Recall for Windows computers that acts as a personal \u201ctime machine,\u201d allowing users to quickly pull up anything that\u2019s ever been on screen, such as documents, images and websites. It\u2019s different from a keyword search; the tool regularly saves screenshots of the user\u2019s screen and stores them directly on the device. It then uses AI to process the data and make it searchable. For example, if someone previously searched for a green dress or the name of a local ice cream shop, they can ask the feature to \u201crecall\u201d anything in their history that was shown on screen. Although so-called semantic search is a big step forward for AI, it comes at a time when the industry is moving so quickly and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use the technology responsibly. Jen Golbeck \u2013 a professor of AI at the University of Maryland who focuses on privacy\u00a0\u2013 said the recall feature could pose a potential \u201cnightmare\u201d if the device falls into the wrong hands. \u201cStuff may stay on your device, but that doesn\u2019t mean people can\u2019t get to it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou won\u2019t have an option to protect yourself even if you use incognito mode or clear your history because the tool has access to everything that\u2019s been on your screen.\u201d The UK\u2019s independent regulator for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), told CNN it is investigating the tool \u201cto understand the safeguards in place to protect user privacy.\u201d \u201cWe expect organisations to be transparent with users about how their data is being used and only process personal data to the extent that it is necessary to achieve a specific purpose,\u201d the ICO said in a statement. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CEO Satya Nadella told The Wall Street Journal in an interview ahead of Monday\u2019s launch that web searches must only be done on Microsoft\u2019s Edge web browser and that the screenshots never leave the user\u2019s computer. \u201cYou have to put two things together: This is my computer and this is my Recall \u2013 and it\u2019s all being done locally,\u201d he said. Geoff Blaber, CEO of market research firm CCS Insight, said that makes the issue less concerning. \u201cThe backlash by some to this feature isn\u2019t surprising, but it\u2019s an overreaction given that the data stays exclusively on the device and the user has full control,\u201d Blaber said. Someone can decide whether to turn the feature on during the device setup process and can customize and blacklist which apps and websites Recall can access. \u201cThese controls suggest the feature has been built with security and privacy at its core,\u201d he said. \u201cRecall won\u2019t appeal to everyone but the utility provided is likely to be significant.\u201d Potential for malicious uses But Golbeck cited times when that protection might not be enough, such as a journalist in a hostile country, a person trying to get out of an abusive relationship, someone searching for sensitive medical information or an employee whose boss wants to track them. She believes issues around the tool will likely impact the workplace the most. \u201cWe know jobs monitor what we\u2019re doing on their devices, but a lot of people will do a personal thing on their work computer and all of that will be archived and visible to an IT department, even if it just stays on device,\u201d she added. Golbeck said technology, despite the benefits, is too often developed without the consideration of malicious uses. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over the last 15 years is every single one of those potential malicious use cases comes to fruition in some way or another,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will want to use this cool feature without understanding the privacy risk \u2013 that there will be a permanent record of everything you do.\u201d Similar reactions to features such as biometric passwords, such as fingerprints, facial recognition and iris scans, have emerged in the past. Blaber said to overcome some of the initial concerns, Microsoft and its partners will need to prove the value, security and privacy of the product in the real world. Still, Michela Menting, a senior research director at ABI Research, believes the feature is a \u201cstep backwards\u201d for privacy. \u201cThe argument that hackers need physical access to even be able to manipulate Recall is short-sighted at best because there are plenty of highly ingenious ways threat actors could exploit such a valuable tool,\u201d she said. \u201cAll it takes is time and effort to find a way.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/tech/microsoft-ai-tool-privacy-recall/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_economy_mortgage-rates-fall-week-of-may-23", "text": "Mortgage rates declined for the third consecutive week in a shred of good news for Americans dealing with a still-tough housing market. The standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.94% in the week ending May 23, down from last week\u2019s average of 7.02%, according to Freddie Mac data released Thursday. That\u2019s the lowest level since early April and below the key 7% threshold. After moving sideways throughout March, mortgage rates began to climb in late April as economic data showed that inflation\u2019s cooldown stalled earlier in the year. Mortgage rates track the benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield, which moves in anticipation of the Federal Reserve\u2019s decisions on interest rates. Stubbornly high inflation this year has dashed hopes that the Fed could cut interest rates in the spring or in the summer. But there\u2019s finally been some good news on that front: The Consumer Price Index for April, released last week, showed that inflation didn\u2019t pick up. Bond yields have mostly retreated this month. \u201cSpring homebuyers received an unexpected windfall this week, as mortgage rates fell below the seven percent threshold for the first time in over a month,\u201d Sam Khater, Freddie Mac\u2019s chief economist, said in a release. Some Fed officials said earlier this week that they likely won\u2019t raise interest rates again and a few have said they expect to cut rates this year. That bodes well for lower mortgage rates. But for now, the housing market\u2019s recovery is stagnant. Sales of previously owned homes, which make up the vast majority of the housing market, fell in April for the second month in a row, the National Association of Realtors reported Wednesday. That\u2019s a stark contrast from earlier in the year when sales soared. The persistent headache of not enough housing supply Mortgage rates are down from a two-decade peak reached last fall, but they\u2019re still higher than anything seen in the decade leading up to 2022.\u00a0That\u2019s not the only key issue besieging the housing market. Another is a persistent under-supply of housing that is simply not keeping up with demand, despite some steady improvements in recent months. That\u2019s partly due to some homeowners deciding to not sell their homes because they\u2019re holding onto the low mortgage rates they locked in before the Fed began to raise interest rates in 2022. With mortgage rates still elevated, some homeowners are deciding to stay put. The pace of residential construction is also not easing enough of the pressure on the housing market to meaningfully improve affordability. Housing starts rebounded in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.36 million units, after declining sharply in the prior month, according to a separate report released last week. But the trend is nowhere near where it should be to make the market easier for many Americans. \u201cThe country needs around 1.6 million or higher for a few years to truly bring about a balance in the housing sector,\u201d Lawrence Yun, NAR\u2019s chief economist, said in statement. \u201cThe housing shortage is not going away,\u201d he said. Still, there have been some steps in the right direction. NAR reported on Wednesday that housing supply continued to improve in April for the fourth straight month. Total housing inventory at the end of April was 1.21 million units, up 9% from the prior month and 16.3% from a year earlier, according to NAR data, though Yun said that \u201cwe still have tight inventory,\u201d Home prices remain painfully high Another hurdle is that home prices remain painfully elevated and out of reach for many Americans, especially first-time buyers. NAR reported Wednesday that home prices continued to rise in April, with the median price of an existing home increasing 5.7% from a year earlier to $407,600. That was the fourth straight monthly expansion and was a record for April prices. Other measures of home prices have shown the same: US home-price growth picked up in February at the fastest annual pace since November 2022, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index. Home prices in San Diego, Chicago and Detroit grew the most in February. High borrowing costs coupled with rising prices and not enough homes on the markets have created a difficult housing market for many. President Joe Biden has proposed some solutions to improve affordability, which would need congressional approval, such as tax credits for middle-class buyers and legislation to shore up homebuilding.

{"id": "2024_05_23_business_attorney-general-looking-into-attempted-graceland-foreclosure", "text": "Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti is looking into the attempted foreclosure auction of Elvis Presley\u2019s iconic Memphis home, known as Graceland, by an alleged private investment company. On Wednesday, Naussany Investments and Private Lending LLC dropped its foreclosure efforts against Graceland. Danielle Riley Keough, Presley\u2019s granddaughter and heir, filed a lawsuit earlier this month to halt the foreclosure sale claiming Naussany Investment\u2019s paperwork was bogus and an attempt to defraud the family. \u201cI have asked my lawyers to look into this matter, determine the full extent of any misconduct that may have occurred, and identify what we can do to protect both Elvis Presley\u2019s heirs and anyone else who may be similarly threatened,\u201d said Skrmetti in a statement. Naussany Investments produced paperwork that Lisa Marie Presley defaulted on a $3.8 million loan, prior to her 2023 passing, and used Graceland as collateral, according to court documents. \u201cThese documents are fraudulent,\u201d Keough\u2019s lawsuit alleges. \u201cLisa Marie Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments.\u201d Keough\u2019s suit also claims that the documents Naussany presented, including a 2018 notarized promissory note signed by Lisa Marie Presley, were forged. Even the notary public whose name appeared on the disputed document, told the court in an affidavit that they had never notarized Lisa Marie Presley\u2019s signature. A Shelby County, Tennessee, Chancellor on Wednesday blocked the foreclosure sale scheduled for this Thursday, noting the notary identified in the transaction, has sworn that they did not notarize the signature of Lisa Marie Presley on the deed of trust bringing into question the authenticity of the signature on the deed. Keough\u2019s ownership of Graceland has been confirmed by a Memphis court, according to Tennessee\u2019s top attorney. \u201cGraceland is one of the most iconic landmarks in the State of Tennessee, and the Presley family have generously shared it with the world since Elvis\u2019s passing,\u201d said Skrmetti. \u201cElvis made Memphis the center of the music universe, and Graceland stands as a monument to his legacy and a fond remembrance for his family. My office has fought fraud against homeowners for decades, and there is no home in Tennessee more beloved than Graceland.\u201d Naussany Investments was listed in court documents as being located in Kimberling City, Missouri, but CNN was unable to locate a business in the state by that name. CNN was also unable to locate a business by that name when searching nationwide. The lender is also unknown to Tennessee banking regulators. Alicia Owens, a public information officer with the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions, told CNN in an e-mail that, \u201cNaussany Investments & Private Lending, LLC (Naussany) is not a licensed mortgage lender in Tennessee and is not regulated by the Department.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/business/attorney-general-looking-into-attempted-graceland-foreclosure/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_tech_meta-ai-adivsory-council-white-men", "text": "Meta this week appointed a group of outside advisors to provide guidance on its artificial intelligence strategy. The four-person advisory group is composed entirely of White men. The tech giant said the group, which includes tech entrepreneurs and investors, will periodically consult with Meta\u2019s management \u201con strategic opportunities related to our technology and product roadmap.\u201d The move comes as Meta plans to invest tens of billions of dollars this year in AI infrastructure, research and product development. The council includes Patrick Collison, the co-founder and chief executive of financial technology company Stripe; Nat Friedman, the tech investor and former CEO of GitHub; Tobi L\u00fctke, the founder and CEO of online shopping firm Shopify; and Charlie Songhurst, the tech investor who formerly led corporate strategy and drove several key acquisitions at Microsoft. A Meta spokesperson confirmed the group will not be paid. Despite the group\u2019s significant combined experience, Meta is already taking heat for failing to include women or people of color \u2014 or anyone else outside of the wealthy, White, male, Silicon Valley mold \u2014 in a group advising one of the world\u2019s most powerful tech companies on a revolutionary new technology. The members of the group are also all in their 30s or 40s. The situation mirrors an incident last year at OpenAI when, in the wake of a leadership shakeup, it came under fire for appointing a board composed entirely of White men. Months later, OpenAI added three women directors to the board. Artificial intelligence is poised to disrupt nearly every area of life in coming years, from how we get hired and work to how we consume entertainment or search for information. The large language models that underpin AI systems are trained on vast troves of data, often written by humans and coming from the internet. Experts say that can create the risk of\u00a0further spreading all-too-human biases\u00a0already entrenched in internet discourse, but at a frighteningly larger scale. And historically, women and people of color have borne the brunt of harms from tech advancements \u2014 making their inclusion in decision-making processes all the more important. Already, women are increasingly becoming the targets of nonconsensual pornography enabled by AI. Meta\u2019s AI-generated photo tool also faced backlash last month for its apparent struggles to create images of couples or friends from different racial backgrounds. Research released last year also suggested that Meta\u2019s Facebook algorithm targets users with job postings based on gender stereotypes, although the company does not allow advertisers themselves to target ads based on gender. \u201cWhen AI systems\u00a0are used as the gatekeeper of opportunities, it is critical that the oversight of the design,\u00a0development, and deployment of these systems reflect the communities that will be impacted by them,\u201d Joy Buolamwini, the founder of the\u00a0Algorithmic Justice League, an organization tracking the harms of artificial intelligence, told CNN earlier this year.

{"id": "2024_05_23_business_takeaways-house-campus-antisemitism-hearing", "text": "The House Committee on Education and the Workforce\u2019s hearing on campus antisemitism Thursday came with no shortage of fiery exchanges between lawmakers and the heads of Northwestern University, Rutgers University and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). But unlike two prior hearings, Thursday\u2019s was the first to take place after a wave of pro-Palestinian encampments spread across campuses nationwide, disrupting learning and commencement ceremonies and ultimately causing many students to feel unsafe. Here are some of the most important takeaways from the hearing that lasted several hours. University heads can\u2019t win Northwestern President Michael Schill and Rutgers University President Dr. Jonathan Holloway negotiated with protesters rather than authorizing police to disband encampments, which UCLA Chancellor Gene Block ultimately did. Both approaches received considerable rebuke from lawmakers on the Republican-led committee. Schill and Holloway were accused of being complicit with protesters, though some Democratic lawmakers found their approaches admirable. \u201cI for one am interested in hearing and learning about what successful negotiation and de-escalation looks like in the context of protecting students and free speech,\u201d Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington state, said. Meanwhile, Block was criticized by some lawmakers for not authorizing police to step in sooner. Block agreed more action should have been taken earlier, saying, \u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, we should have been prepared to immediately remove the encampment if and when the safety of our community was put at risk.\u201d A lot of investigations but limited consequences yet In one of the hearing\u2019s tensest exchanges, Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik slammed Schill\u00a0for not taking any action against someone who allegedly told a Jewish student to \u201cgo back to Germany and get gassed.\u201d Schill said that he heard about that happening and \u201cit is being investigated.\u201d\u00a0So far, no students who are being investigated for various alleged acts of antisemitism have been expelled or suspended, he said. Rutgers\u2019 Holloway and UCLA\u2019s Block similarly said the universities have many active investigations underway. Holloway said his school has suspended four people and 19 others have received additional disciplinary actions. A bounty of lawyerly responses If you tuned in to Thursday\u2019s hearing and thought the responses university heads gave were pre-rehearsed, it\u2019s because they likely were. The three university heads at the hearing had the advantage of learning from the prior campus hearings. All were especially keen on not repeating the mistake made by University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill and other school presidents who did not explicitly say calls for the genocide of Jews violated their codes of conduct. But the school leaders on Thursday still leaned into giving lawyerly responses, especially in tense lines of questioning to avoid being cornered into taking a stance on divisive issues. For instance, when Holloway was asked if he thought Israel\u2019s government was genocidal he responded, \u201cSir, I don\u2019t have an opinion on Israel\u2019s \u2014 in terms of that phrase.\u201d Meanwhile, Schill said more than once that he would not comment on individual students or faculty members in the hearing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/business/takeaways-house-campus-antisemitism-hearing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
