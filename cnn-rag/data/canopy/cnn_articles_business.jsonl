{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_business_china-record-heat-rain-food-security-intl-hnk", "text": "China is grappling with extreme weather as severe drought and record temperatures scorch the north while heavy rains inundate the south, raising concerns about food security in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Areas of the country that produce a lot of rice and wheat have been badly affected, disrupting spring and summer planting seasons. The Ministry of Agriculture said Thursday that drought and heat have had an adverse impact on the planting season in some northern and central provinces, and it warned that temperatures were expected to surpass 35 Celsius (95 Fahrenheit) in the coming days. An emergency alert covering at least seven provinces, including the major agricultural regions of Henan and Shandong, was already in place because of dry, hot conditions. \u201cThe recent persistently high temperatures have accelerated the loss of water in the soil and (caused) drought in some areas, which has negatively affected the summer sowing season,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. \u201cThe drought is likely to continue and the task of protecting the summer planting season is difficult.\u201d In Henan, China\u2019s top wheat producing region which accounts for a quarter of total output, rainfall in May was 70% lower than the yearly average, Yang Wentao, a provincial official, told national broadcaster CCTV on Wednesday. Parts of the country are experiencing a major heat wave. The China Meteorological Administration (CMA) said on Wednesday that 28 regional weather stations broke their respective records for the highest temperature ever recorded in mid June. The city of Fenyang in the northern province of Shanxi registered its highest temperature ever recorded at 40.2 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). China had its hottest spring on record this year. The national average temperature between March and May reached 12.3 degrees Celsius, the highest since records began in 1961, with 12 national meteorological stations registering temperatures reaching or surpassing records, according to\u00a0the National Climate Center. Last year was the country\u2019s hottest year on record. Meanwhile, southern parts of the country, the top rice growing region, have been grappling with weeks of downpours. In April, the Ministry of Agriculture said in a statement that rainfall in parts of the region had risen by 50% to 80%, and had even doubled in some areas. It made a series of recommendations on reducing damage to growing \u201cearly rice\u201d saplings, which are planted in March and harvested in June. The CMA said on Thursday that heavy rainfall had occurred in the Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi and Guizhou regions \u2014 some of them major manufacturing and industrial centers. Hunan and Jiangxi are two of China\u2019s biggest rice producers. China\u2019s State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, a national coordination agency, issued an emergency response to both the flooding in the south and the drought in the north on Thursday, warning of a high risk of flash floods and geologic hazards. These rains appear to be related to a seasonal monsoon pattern that can lead to intense showers over short periods.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/business/china-record-heat-rain-food-security-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

CDK operates numerous different types of products car dealers use to handle things like keeping records of negotiated deals to scheduling and communicating about service. Not every dealer uses CDK\u2019s products, and even those that do may not use them for everything, but it\u2019s been a problem for many. \u201cWe have customers coming in today who had deals saved in the system,\u201d said Jeff Ramsey, an executive with Ourisman Auto Group, which is headquartered in Maryland. To protect customer privacy, customer\u2019s details aren\u2019t written out on a piece of paper that\u2019s just sitting on the desk anymore. Instead, information about deals and customer appointments is kept in a server that\u2019s now impossible for his salespeople to access. Ramsey said he understands, though, that CDK is doing what it feels it must to secure this sensitive data. But it\u2019s a major hassle in the meantime and could cost his dealerships some business.

{"id": "2024_06_14_cars_chrome-cars-stellantis-jeep-volkswagen-vw", "text": "Chrome\u2019s century-long reign as that added bit of flash and glamour on new cars may be coming to an end. For least one major auto maker, environmental and serious health concerns are outweighing its aesthetic appeal. Chrome has long provided an eye-catching sparkle, creating an upscale look while also protecting unpainted metal car parts from corrosion. It\u2019s served as a by-word for (especially American) automotive opulence. \u201cChrome on a car is the automotive equivalent of using jewelry on an outfit,\u201d said Leslie Kendall, head curator of the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. But Stellantis \u2013 the company that makes Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Fiat, and Maserati vehicles \u2013 among others, is committed to doing away with chrome on all its new models. The plan even has a name. Inside Stellantis, it\u2019s called \u201cDeath of Chrome,\u201d said Stellantis\u2019s chief global designer, Ralph Gilles. Stellantis vehicles, including its newest Jeep model, will sport badges and trim pieces that may not have chrome\u2019s mirror-like shine but customers will come to like them even better, Gilles promises. \u2018Death of Chrome\u2019 \u201cDeath of Chrome\u201d comes in response to chrome plating\u2019s lesser-known dark side. Hexavalent chromium, or \u201cchromium 6,\u201d the form of the element chromium involved in the plating process, is an aggressive cancer-causing agent, according to government regulators in the United States and Europe. \u201cHexavalent chromium is a carcinogen that is the second most potent toxic air contaminant identified by the state,\u201d the California Air Resources Board said in a statement provided to CNN. \u201cIt is 500 times more toxic than diesel exhaust and has no known safe level of exposure.\u201d This does not mean that the chrome-plated parts on your car or motorcycle are dangerous. The metallic form of chrome that provides the mirror shine on a car brand\u2019s logo or trim is perfectly safe. The risk to human health comes during the electro-plating process, regulators say, when the hexavalent chromium that is used can come into contact with workers or be released into the atmosphere. Chrome platers have methods to contain the vapors and minimize human exposure. Southern California boasts the highest concentration of chrome plating shops in America and regulators in that state have been requiring those methods for years. But California is now moving toward an outright ban on chrome plating using hexavalent chromium while offering funding for chrome platers to transition to other methods. Hexavalent chromium is used in a number of different industries besides automotive. It\u2019s also used to increase the hardness of steel, for instance, and as an anti-corrosive agent added to paints, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. In 2019, green slime oozing out onto a highway near Detroit was found to be hexavalent chromium leaking from a nearby business. In that case, a Michigan environmental agency cleaned up the toxic mess. The National Association for Surface Finishing, an industry organization representing chrome platers, among others, said their industry has made a lot of progress to keep chrome plating safe for workers and the environment but acknowledged alternatives are needed. \u201cWorking collaboratively and effectively with EPA, OSHA, and state regulatory agencies, the plating industry has achieved an approximately\u00a099.9%\u00a0reduction in hexavalent chromium\u00a0air emissions since 1995\u00a0to protect the environment, human health, and worker safety,\u201d said Christian Richter, vice president for policy at NASF, in an email to CNN. \u201cNASF is working in partnership with the automotive industry to ensure a transition to the safest and most sustainable\u00a0alternatives and replacements.\u201d There are are less dangerous alternatives, Gilles said, but, for now, at least, they either don\u2019t look as good as traditional chrome plate, don\u2019t last as long, or are prohibitively expensive for mass production vehicles. For instance, trivalent chrome uses a different form of chromium and a simpler process. Falling out of love with chrome \u201cThe problem is the luster isn\u2019t as good. It has a more yellow kind of finish,\u201d Gilles said. \u201cWhereas hexavalent is extremely good, very brilliant, very clear and that\u2019s why people have come to love it. They don\u2019t realize what they\u2019re looking at, but they\u2019ve come to love it. We have to make them unlove it.\u201d The best way to do that, said Gilles, will be to entice car buyers with styles and designs that don\u2019t use chrome at all, or anything like it. There are the extremely popular \u201cblackout packages\u201d that are already available as an option on most Stellantis models. These replace all the exterior \u201cbrightwork,\u201d like chrome badges and grilles, with matte black pieces for a dark, sinister look. \u201cSometimes people go and personally convert their cars to blackout packages,\u201d Gilles said. \u201cThey call it \u2018murdered out\u2019 on the street.\u201d Years ago, Gilles even did it to his own 2016 Chrysler minivan creating a look that eventually came to market as the Chrysler Pacifica S Package with a black grille and a black-winged Chrysler logo. Black\u2019s not the only option, though. The \u201cmurdered out\u201d look doesn\u2019t work for everyone. \u201cSometimes a vehicle can look a little bit \u2018triste,\u2019 as they say in French, sad, when it\u2019s all black,\u201d said Gilles. Polished stainless steel looks a lot like chrome but it\u2019s expensive. Satin steel with a dull finish looks refined and is less expensive. Mixing different tones and textures can be even better, Gilles said. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t want a very holistic, black and white type of contrast. Sometimes a tonal contrast is even more attractive,\u201d Gilles said. \u201cSo we\u2019re using bronzes and silvers and graphites where chrome used to be, to create that offset.\u201d Stellantis has, for years, been trying out chrome alternatives on special edition models that, generally, have done even better than expected with consumers. It\u2019s a good sign that car buyers are ready for something different. The upcoming Jeep Wagoneer S electric SUV will be one of the first Stellantis models to sport some of these new looks. It will have no chrome at all, even as an option. The same will be true on all Stellantis\u2019s other new models, Gilles said. A spokesperson for Volkswagen Group\u2019s design department \u2013 VW Group operates various brands including Audi and Bentley \u2013 said VW is also looking at alternatives to hexavalent chrome as its use becomes more strictly curtailed in various markets, including Europe. VW designers are working with finishes of various tones and textures to accent different models. \u201cWe are also using light as the new chrome,\u201d VW said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cLight gives us more possibilities in both exterior and interior applications.\u201d Already, many VW models sport round VW logos that glow at night. Stellantis has also used glowing badges on some of its concept vehicles. It helps that the use of chrome on modern cars is already much reduced from its glaring peaks. Chrome first started appearing on cars in the 1920s as a shinier and easier to maintain alternative to nickel and, before that, brass, said the Petersen Museum\u2019s Kendall. After a few decades, it reached a \u201cmore is always better\u201d apotheosis around the same time cars sprouted fins, Gilles said. \u201cChrome peaked in the \u201950s with the big American land yachts and stuff with giant chrome bumpers and giant chrome grills.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_business_boeing-whistleblower-calhoun-testimony", "text": "A current Boeing employee claims that the company tried to shield broken or out-of-specification 737 Max plane parts from regulators and lost track of them, according to a Senate subcommittee investigation made public Tuesday. Boeing tried to hide the nonconforming parts from Federal Aviation Administration regulators by moving them out of sight and falsifying records, claims Sam Mohawk, the new whistleblower who works for Boeing quality assurance unit in Renton, Washington. Boeing was unable to account for many of the parts that it moved around to skirt regulators, and they probably ended up getting installed in some planes, Mohawk said. Boeing said it received the report from Congressional investigators Monday evening. \u201cWe are reviewing the claims,\u201d said the company\u2019s statement. \u201cWe continuously encourage employees to report all concerns as our priority is to ensure the safety of our airplanes and the flying public.\u201d Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun will be confronted with the new claims in addition to other whistleblower charges about Boeing\u2019s safety lapses at his first-ever congressional hearing Tuesday. The outgoing Boeing CEO plans to apologize for Boeing\u2019s recent safety failures in his testimony. According to his prepared testimony shared with CNN, Calhoun will admit to problems with the company\u2019s culture, but he\u2019ll push back on claims that the company retaliated against those who brought safety issues to light. \u201cMuch has been said about Boeing\u2019s culture. We\u2019ve heard those concerns loud and clear,\u201d he will say in prepared remarks released by Boeing Monday afternoon. \u201cOur culture is far from perfect, but we are taking action and making progress. We understand the gravity, and we are committed to moving forward.\u201d The \u201cfar from perfect\u201d remark is a massive understatement. Boeing has been under intense scrutiny with numerous federal investigations and congressional hearings since a January 5 Alaska Air Boeing 737 Max flight had a door plug blow off, leaving a gaping hole in both the plane and Boeing\u2019s reputation. Beyond the bad publicity of the Senate hearing, Boeing has been ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration to improve its safety issues before it can resume normal production, causing problems for airlines that can\u2019t get the planes they ordered. And that, in turn, has meant higher fares for passengers, who have had their faith the company\u2019s planes sorely tested. Prioritizing profits over safety In prepared remarks released early Tuesday from Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat who chairs the committee, the senator accuses Calhoun of putting profits of airplane safety, of leading a company where those raising safety concerns regularly faced retaliation, despite the claims otherwise from management. \u201cThis is a culture that continues to prioritize profits, push limits, and disregard its workers,\u201d said the prepared opening remarks released by Blumenthal.\u00a0\u201cA culture where those who speak up are silenced and sidelined while blame is pushed down to the factory floor.\u00a0A culture that enables retaliation against those who do not submit to the bottom line.\u00a0A culture that desperately needs to be repaired.\u201d Blumenthal told CNN Tuesday that his committee has heard from a dozen whistleblowers at Boeing, including Mohawk. \u201cHis allegations are extraordinarily serious,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cHis account of the retaliation against him is particularly chilling the pressure that was exerted on him to stay silent. They have a program called Speak up well, he was told to shut up.\u201d Blumenthal said he and others had hoped that Calhoun would change the culture and practices at Boeing for the better when he was took over as CEO in January 2020, 10 months into a 20-month grounding of the 737 Max that followed two fatal crashes. \u201cBut then, this past January, the fa\u00e7ade quite literally blew off the hollow shell that had been Boeing\u2019s promises to the world,\u201d Blumenthal will say, according to his prepared testimony, a reference to the door plug blowout.\u00a0\u201cAnd once that chasm was exposed, we learned that there was virtually no bottom to the void that lay below.\u201d An extensive research document prepared by committee aides show the panel is armed with whistleblower accounts from inside Boeing.\u00a0Some of the whistleblowers in the document have shared their accounts publicly or with CNN. Among them is Mohawk\u2019s claim that in June 2023, when the FAA notified Boeing that it would inspect its Renton plant, the company told employees to move the majority of the 60 nonconforming parts to another location to hide them from inspectors. Many of them were moved back, but some were lost, Mohawk alleges. He also claims Boeing in August 2023 told employees to delete records about nonconforming parts, which led him to complain \u2013 but Boeing took no action. Aides wrote in a memo that the whistleblowers\u00a0\u201cpaint a troubling picture of a company that prioritizes speed of manufacturing and cutting costs over ensuring the quality and safety of aircraft.\u201d \u201cThese misplaced priorities appear to contribute to a safety culture that insufficiently values and addresses the root causes of employee concerns and insufficiently deters retaliation against employees that speak up,\u201d the memo reads. The hearing Tuesday by the Senate\u2019s permanent subcommittee on investigations is entitled \u201cBoeing\u2019s broken safety culture.\u201d It is just the latest congressional hearing this year about safety issues at Boeing but the first time Calhoun is testifying in his more than four years running the troubled company. He will be joined by Howard McKenzie, Boeing\u2019s chief engineer. At an April 17 hearing Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour testified that Boeing is putting out defective planes because he and others who complain faced pressure not to do so. \u201cI have serious concerns about the safety of the 787 and 777 aircraft, and I\u2019m willing to take on professional risk to talk about them,\u201d Salehpour said in his opening statement. He said when he raised concerns, \u201cI was ignored. I was told not to create delays. I was told, frankly, to shut up.\u201d Calhoun\u2019s prepared remarks deny the claims of the whistleblowers and Blumenthal about retaliation against those who raise safety concerns. \u201cWe are committed to making sure every employee feels empowered to speak up if there is a problem,\u201d he\u2019ll say, according to the prepared remarks. \u201cWe also have strict policies in place to prohibit retaliation against employees who come forward. It is our job to listen, regardless of how we obtain feedback, and handle it with the seriousness it deserves.\u201d Will there be changes? Despite the attention the hearing is expected to garner, it\u2019s unlikely to produce significant change at the company, said Richard Aboulafia, managing partner for AeroDynamic Consultancy, an aerospace advisory firm. \u201cNothing has produced change (at Boeing) except frustration from a bunch of airline customers,\u201d said Aboulafia. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what will change as a consequence of this. He (Calhoun) needs to go. He has shown a strong desire to double down on what\u2019s bad.\u201d A preliminary investigation of the Alaska Air incident has found that the plane left a Boeing factory two months before the incident without the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place. And Boeing has yet to produce the paperwork to identify who in the factory installed the door plug without the bolts. It has been harshly criticized by members of Congress and safety regulators and will likely face more criticism Tuesday. Calhoun has already met with members of Congress since the Alaska Air incident, albeit behind closed doors. He has also made numerous public statements to Boeing employees and to investors since the Alaska Air incident. \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that,\u201d he told investors in January during a call after reporting its fifth straight annual loss. \u201cWhatever conclusions (from the investigations) are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better.\u201d Apologies to families, passengers Calhoun\u2019s prepared remarks begin with an apology to the family members of the victims of two fatal 737 Max crashes. Some of those family members plan to attend the hearing. Between them, 346 people were killed in the 2018 and 2019 crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, leading to to a 20-month grounding of the jet to fix a design flaw that caused the crashes. \u201cWe are deeply sorry for your losses,\u201d he\u2019ll say in his opening comments. \u201cNothing is more important than the safety of the people who step on board our airplanes. Every day we seek to honor the memory of those lost.\u201d He also plans to again apologize to the passengers and crew of the Alaska Air flight in January. \u201cWe deeply regret the impact that the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 accident had on Alaska Airlines\u2019 team and its passengers, and we are grateful to the pilots and crew for safely landing the plane,\u201d he\u2019ll say. \u201cWe are thankful that there were no fatalities.\u201d But experts say that it was sheer luck that no one was killed in the Alaska Air incident. This could very well be Calhoun\u2019s only time testifying on Capitol Hill. He has announced plans to retire before the end of this year. His successor has yet to be selected. Beyond Tuesday\u2019s hearing, and the numerous federal investigations it faces, the company could still face criminal liability from the original certification process of the 737 Max. In January of 2021 Boeing agreed to a probationary period, which deferred any prosecution on those charges and which would have exempted it from criminal liability in the crashes. But the January 5 incident aboard the Alaska Air flight happened just days before the end of the probationary period. In May the Justice Department notified Boeing that it was now subject to criminal prosecution. Boeing has denied the Alaska Air incident violated the deferred prosecution agreement and is challenging any potential criminal liability in court. The family members planning to attend Tuesday\u2019s hearing say they want to see Boeing prosecuted criminally. Blumenthal told CNN Tuesday that he will reserve judgment on whether Boeing is guilty of criminal misconduct but that \u201cI think there is mounting evidence, perhaps overwhelming evidence now, that prosecution should be pursued.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/business/boeing-whistleblower-calhoun-testimony/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_business_employer-obligations-worker-safety-heat-waves", "text": "Summer is just starting in North America, and already an intense \u201cheat dome\u201d is forecast to affect more than half the US population this week. Some areas, including Montpelier, Vermont; Syracuse, New York; and Pittsburgh, haven\u2019t seen heat like this in about three decades. Along with stifling days comes the risk of developing dangerous heat-related conditions, such as dehydration, heat stress, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and other hazards. While you can take as many measures as you like to stay cool at home, what about when you go to work? What responsibilities does your employer have to prevent you from suffering a heat-related illness? And what can you do if you think those aren\u2019t being met? Under the federal law that created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, employers always have a duty to keep your workplace free of known hazards. \u201cThis includes protecting workers from heat-related hazards,\u201d OSHA notes on its website. And it applies whether you work outdoors or indoors. While some states have specific laws governing occupational heat exposure, there is no heat-specific federal regulation mandating how employers must prevent heat illness in the workplace. But they are expected to \u201ctake reasonable action to prevent their employees from illness and death.\u201d Nor is there a specific threshold that defines \u201cextreme heat,\u201d although OSHA said it is working \u201ctowards enacting a federal heat standard that encompasses indoor and outdoor workers.\u201d The heat an employee\u2019s body experiences will depend on a lot of factors beyond the general temperature.\u00a0\u201cFor someone working outside without shade and working on cement \u2013 the heat index is going to be higher for them than [if the thermometer says] it\u2019s 85 degrees,\u201d said attorney Jason Krasno, a senior partner at Krasno, Krasno & Onwudinjo, who specializes in worker compensation cases. The same goes if someone is working in high humidity or in rooms where air circulation is poor and there is no air conditioning. Anyone required to wear a uniform that doesn\u2019t breathe may be at greater risk of overheating. And an employee\u2019s underlying chronic conditions such as asthma and heart disease may make them more vulnerable to heat risks. At minimum, your employer should take basic preventative measures All that said, both OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which research the prevention of work-related illnesses and injury, provide recommendations for employers to follow as they seek to keep workers safe on hot days. They recommend companies: Have a heat illness prevention plan. It should outline procedures, supplies and equipment necessary to prevent workers from getting a heat-related illness, as well as an emergency action plan if a worker shows signs of distress. Make water easily accessible. \u201cEncourage workers to drink at least one cup every 20 minutes, even if they are not thirsty,\u201d according to OSHA recommendations. Allow regular rest breaks. These should be in the shade or a cool area. Give employees time to acclimate. OSHA recommends the so-called \u201c20% rule.\u201d \u201cOn the first day, don\u2019t allow employees to work more than 20% of a shift at full intensity in the heat. Increase their time by no more than 20% a day until they are used to working in the heat.\u201d In a worker\u2019s first few days, the agency notes, \u201cabsolutely all symptoms should be taken seriously\u201d and workers should be allowed to stop working and get an evaluation to see if they\u2019ve developed a heat-related illness. \u201cNew employees whose bodies have not had time to adjust to working in the heat are most vulnerable \u2014 nearly 3 out of 4 workers who die from heat-related causes die in their first week on the job,\u201d OSHA notes in its Extreme Heat Hazard Alert. Encourage employees to dress for the heat. That means wearing light-colored, loose fitting, breathable clothing. Monitor workers for signs and symptoms of heat illness. These include dizziness, fainting, nausea and muscle spasms. Also, do verbal checks frequently with workers who are wearing face coverings or wearing face equipment like a respirator. Managers should encourage employees to do the same for themselves and their coworkers. Should any signs appear, try to cool the worker down and \u201cwhen in doubt, call 911,\u201d OSHA recommends. Change work hours. Another OSHA-recommended accommodation employers may make when feasible is to alter employees\u2019 working hours so that they work primarily during the coolest parts of a day \u2014 such as very early morning or after the sun goes down, said attorney Alka Ramchandani-Raj, who is co-chair of\u00a0the occupational safety and health practice group at Littler, a law firm representing employers in employment law and labor practice issues. What you can do To find out more about your particular employer\u2019s obligations and commitment to providing a healthy workplace, first check the company\u2019s safety handbook to see what recommendations they build into their policies and what the best way is to alert managers about potentially unsafe working conditions, Ramchandani-Raj noted. Next, check to see which rules and recommendations your employer should be following in the state where you work. While more than 20 states are subject to federal OSHA requirements, which establish the most basic obligations of most US employers, your particular state may have its own OSHA-like agency that establishes more stringent rules. If you suspect your employer is not providing a healthy workplace, you can file a confidential complaint with OSHA either by calling 800-321-OSHA or filing online. \u201cYou have the right to speak up about hazards\u00a0without fear of retaliation,\u201d OSHA notes. The agency also noted that it \u201cis planning enhanced enforcement actions, with a strategic focus on geographic locations and industries where high heat impacts vulnerable worker populations.\u201d Translation: More inspection activity and greater enforcement. And, it added, \u201cOSHA will also be providing outreach and compliance assistance to ensure employers, including those not covered by the OSH Act, and worker organizations have the tools to protect workers from hazardous heat.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/business/employer-obligations-worker-safety-heat-waves/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. It\u2019s tough being a Wall Street bear these days. The S&P 500 index has climbed nearly 15% this year and clinched 30 record-high closes. Strong corporate earnings and the artificial intelligence helped drive stocks higher at the start of this year, despite a slew of hotter-than-expected inflation reports that fueled concerns the Federal Reserve would be slow to cut interest rates in 2024. Then, fresh data in May revealed last week that inflation is cooling again and getting closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target. The central bank at its June policy meeting held rates steady and penciled in one cut for 2024. After waffling over whether the Fed would ease monetary policy at all in 2024, traders are now betting on two to three cuts, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The new backdrop of cooling inflation coupled with rate cuts on the horizon is prompting investors to up their bullish wagers. Goldman Sachs on Friday raised its year-end target for the benchmark index to 5,600 from 5,200, citing a strong outlook for corporate profits. That would be a 2.3% advance from Monday\u2019s close. Evercore ISI raised its price target to 6,000 for the S&P 500, a reversal from its previous, more gloomy 4,750 target. That higher level would be a 9.6% jump from Monday\u2019s close. \u201cThe backdrop of slowing inflation, a Fed intent on cutting rates and steady growth have supported Goldilocks,\u201d wrote Julian Emanuel, a senior managing director at Evercore ISI, in a Sunday note. \u201cThe rally has room.\u201d The market has also been distinguished by uncharacteristic calm. Stock sell-offs have been short and shallow. The S&P 500 has had its longest stretch of trading days without a 2% or more decline since February 2018, according to SoFi data as of June 12. While low volatility sounds like a positive, it\u2019s not without danger. It suggests that investors are taking on more risk in their portfolios due to an overly optimistic view and could be caught flat-footed if the tide turns. There\u2019s no shortage of risks that could unnerve markets in the coming months. Much of the S&P 500 index\u2019s returns are tied to the mega-cap tech Magnificent Seven stocks, leaving the market dependent on just a handful of names to continue its monster run. Stocks could also wobble leading up to the US presidential election in November. Some investors warn that despite encouraging economic data, a recession could still be in the cards for 2024 or next year. Despite its more bullish baseline target, Goldman Sachs warned that the S&P 500 index could end the year at 4,800, a 12.3% drop from current levels, if economic growth data turns sour and markets price in higher odds of a recession. The strange economics of pig meat: Ham prices are down, but bacon\u2019s up Shoppers in the meat aisle may have noticed something weird last month: Bacon prices are sizzling, but ham\u2019s not so hot, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner. Bacon is more expensive than it was a year ago, with prices up 6.9% from May 2023 to May of this year, according to inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Pork chops were up too, by 4.6%. But ham prices were lower, falling 5.4% overall and dropping 6.3% when you exclude canned varieties. What gives? Econ buffs may remember that prices are set according to supply and demand. You\u2019d expect any supply issues \u2014 like too many hogs, or too few \u2014 to cause prices of each of the items to move up or down, all in the same direction. The discrepancy, then, must be caused by differences on the demand side. And it is: Demand for domestic pork has grown in recent years outside of the US. But rising demand, plus the same or reduced supply, should push prices up, not down. So again, what gives? To understand you have to zoom out, looking at long-term retail pricing strategy and food price trends.

Then, he was told the purchase might get him prison time, reports my colleague Samantha Delouya. \u201cThat was really shocking to me. It\u2019s just purchasing property,\u201d Bian, who is originally from Nanjing, China, said. \u201cOnce I learned that, I didn\u2019t even bother to look anymore.\u201d Bian, a 31-year-old software engineer who has lived in the US for 12 years, is a recipient of an H-1B visa, which allows companies to employ foreign workers. For nearly a year, however, it has been a crime for him to purchase a home in Florida after the state\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, signed a law restricting Chinese nationals without US green cards from purchasing property in the state. Bian and other Florida residents told CNN that the rules have fostered uneasiness and confusion among ethnic Chinese people living in the state. Some say the law has damaged their businesses, while others say they are considering abandoning Florida altogether. And the law underscores the heightened tensions between the two biggest economies in the world in a US presidential election year. Bian said that lately, he had begun reconsidering his life in Florida. He isn\u2019t alone. Ever since Florida Senate Bill 264 went into effect on July 1, 2023, Chinese citizens without green cards face a felony charge and possible prison time if they purchase property in the state. Sellers and real estate agents can also be found liable under the law.

{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_media_infowars-liquidation-alex-jones-sandy-hook-families", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Alex Jones\u2019 conspiracy empire is on the brink. The fate of the right-wing extremist\u2019s\u00a0Infowars\u00a0outlet could be decided on Friday as a Texas bankruptcy court hears a high-stakes motion filed by the families of the\u00a0Sandy Hook\u00a0victims over whether to liquidate the company. The families, who have yet to see a penny of the approximately $1.5 billion in judgments they are owed, have argued to the court that there is \u201cno prospect\u201d the company can produce a proper reorganization plan under a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. After years of waiting, they have asked the court to liquidate Jones\u2019\u00a0Free Speech Systems, the parent of Infowars. If the judge rules in favor of Sandy Hook families, Infowars would be shuttered. In such a scenario, a court-appointed trustee would be tasked with securing the assets and then selling off Jones\u2019 media empire, including the website, studio space, and broadcasting equipment. \u201cInfowars would no longer exist,\u201d\u00a0Christopher Mattei, an attorney who represents some of the Sandy Hook families, explained this week to CNN\u2019s\u00a0Hadas Gold. The process could play out quickly, denying Jones the megaphone he has used for decades to spread dangerous and hateful conspiracy theories. Since founding Infowars in the late 1990s, Jones has poisoned the public discourse with toxic commentary, most notably pushing the lie that the 2012 Newtown, Connecticut, shooting was a so-called \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation staged by the government and that the grieving family members of 20 child victims were \u201cactors.\u201d Jones, who hawks high-priced dietary supplements to his audience, has used the lies to enrich himself to the tune of millions of dollars. While juries in Texas and Connecticut punished Jones, awarding the Sandy Hook families hundreds of millions of dollars, the radical host has been able to continue operating his conspiracy empire after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Jones, who also filed for personal bankruptcy protection, moved to\u00a0liquidate his personal assets\u00a0last week, meaning that even if the judge does not order such a move for his company, it will ultimately mean he no longer owns Infowars in the future. While it\u2019s possible that the liquidation of Jones\u2019 company, if ordered by the court on Friday, could lead to its ultimate demise, a court-appointed trustee could opt to sell the company to a potential buyer. Perhaps a fellow conspiracy theorist, such as\u00a0Tucker Carlson, who is trying to gain traction with his own media startup, would be interested in purchasing the assets. But the attorneys representing Sandy Hook families expect that the most likely scenario is Jones\u2019 Infowars empire will be sold off, piece by piece, with the proceeds going to their clients. The outlet\u2019s potential demise is the latest instance in which the legal system is holding right-wing media outlets accountable for their lies. Companies operated by dishonest conspiracy profiteers rarely \u2014\u00a0if ever\u00a0\u2014 admit to wrongdoing unless they are either threatened by or face legal action, leaving the courts the only real avenue for victims of lies to correct the public record. In the last year,\u00a0Fox News\u00a0paid a historic $787.5 million settlement\u00a0to voting technology company\u00a0Dominion Voting Systems.\u00a0The Gateway Pundit\u00a0filed for bankruptcy protection.\u00a0One America News\u00a0settled a case\u00a0with voting technology company\u00a0Smartmatic.\u00a0Salem Media Group\u00a0apologized for and stopped distributing\u00a0an election denialist documentary from\u00a0Dinesh D\u2019Souza. And several cases are still pending in the legal system. While the wheels of the legal system turn slowly, they have been proven to be effective in helping victims recoup some of the damages for the lies. Of course, no monetary award can ever heal the wounds inflicted by the reprehensible lies Jones told about Sandy Hook, dishonoring the children massacred that day and tormenting their families for years. But the liquidation of Jones\u2019 assets will represent some progress. \u201cIf the judge ordered Alex Jones\u2019 business to be liquidated\u2026 that will be a moment the families can take some pride in,\u201d Mattei said. \u201cTheir objective has long been to protect their families and other families from the type of harm that Alex Jones inflicted on them for years.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/media/infowars-liquidation-alex-jones-sandy-hook-families/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech.

{"id": "2024_06_19_media_wikipedia-adl", "text": "Wikipedia\u2019s editors declared that the Anti-Defamation League cannot be trusted to give reliable information on the Israel-Palestine conflict, and they overwhelmingly said the ADL is an unreliable source on antisemitism. It\u2019s a stunning rebuke to one of the world\u2019s preeminent authorities on anti-Jewish hate and a significant advocate for the rights and causes of American Jews. The editors, a group of volunteer moderators for one of the world\u2019s most popular information websites, voted last week to label the ADL as a \u201cgenerally unreliable\u201d source on the Israel-Palestine conflict. That means that the ADL should usually not be cited in Wikipedia articles on that topic except for extraordinary circumstances. Other generally unreliable sources, according to Wikipedia editors, include Russian state media, Fox News\u2019 political coverage and Amazon reviews. The ADL also faces a vote from Wikipedia editors to potentially label the organization as unreliable on the topic of antisemitism. The editors overwhelmingly support that label but continue to debate the decision, which could ultimately deal a blow to the credibility of the leading source of research and information on antisemitism. The Wikipedia editors said in an online forum that the ADL\u2019s dual role as an advocacy and research organization prevented it from providing unbiased accounts on Israel or antisemitism. \u201cThe ADL is heavily biased regarding Israel/Palestine to the point of often acting as a pro-Israel lobbying organization,\u201d wrote an editor with the username Loki, who has edited more than 3,000 Wikipedia articles. \u201cThis can and does compromise its ability to accurately report facts regarding people and organizations that disagree with it on this issue, especially non-Zionist or anti-Zionist Jews and Jewish organizations.\u201d A minority of editors disagreed, arguing the editors voting in favor failed to provide evidence that the ADL has made false claims because of its advocacy work. The ADL strongly rebuked the decision. \u201cIt is deeply disturbing that the many editors who flagged the severe flaws and inaccuracies in both the reasoning and sources being used in this campaign to delegitimize ADL are being ignored,\u201d an ADL spokesman said in a statement. \u201cThey have provided point by point refutations, grounded in factual citations, to every claim made, but apparently facts no longer matter.\u201d Calling the decision \u201ca sad development for research and education\u201d and \u201cdevastating for the Jewish community and society,\u201d the ADL said it would continue its work to fight antisemitism. But the spokesman warned Wikipedia\u2019s action would prevent information on antisemitism from reaching the public. ADL adapts to a changing world Prior to Hamas\u2019 deadly attack on Israel on October 7, the ADL had been largely focused on educating about and advocating for action against the rise in antisemitism around the world. That alarming trend included (and continues to include) a growing number of threats and anti-Jewish actions taken by White supremacist groups, and ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt became a frequent guest on television news, such as CNN. After the events of October 7 and the ongoing war that followed, the ADL produced numerous reports about rising antisemitic hate speech and incidents, particularly on college campuses. It produced two report cards on universities\u2019 actions to protect Jewish students, giving failing grades to more than a dozen colleges. But the ADL faced some criticism for doubling down on what some detractors believed was an overly broad definition of antisemitism that included anti-Zionism and some anti-Israel speech and actions. \u201cADL\u2019s leadership has taken a much more aggressive stance than most academic researchers in blurring the distinction between anti-Zionism and antisemitism,\u201d said James Loeffler, professor of modern Jewish history at John Hopkins University. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from reading the Wikipedia editors\u2019 conversation that they are heavily influenced by the ADL leadership\u2019s comments.\u201d Greenblatt and the ADL made clear that political opposition to Israel\u2019s government and policies were acceptable and not antisemitic. But those who denied Jews had the right to self-determination and freedom in their homeland were antisemitic, according to the ADL. \u201cLet\u2019s make this very clear: Anti-Zionism is antisemitism,\u201d Greenblatt said at an ADL \u201cState of Hate\u201d event in March. \u201cAntizionism is a negation of Jewish history, a denial of Jewish humanity.\u201d That didn\u2019t sit well with Wikipedia\u2019s editors. For example, one editor, with the username Sameboat, claimed the ADL leader\u2019s advocacy \u201cdemonstrates its skewed views and manipulative presentation on the IP (Israel-Palestine) topic and thus (is) highly unreliable.\u201d Balancing advocacy with trusted information The ADL has built an expertise in tracking antisemitic threats and hate groups and has done beneficial work in providing the world with information and data about antisemitism, particularly because so few organizations are doing that kind of research, noted Loeffler. And the fact that the ADL balances advocacy with research is not a new problem for the organization. But Wikipedia\u2019s decision may reflect a changing landscape that the ADL needs to reckon with. The war in Gaza has deeply divided people of all backgrounds, including Jews. The war has added significant ambiguity and complications to the world\u2019s view of the Israel-Palestine conflict. If Wikipedia\u2019s editors are distancing themselves from the ADL, that could suggest media, academic and partnering advocacy organizations will think twice about how they approach ADL data in their own efforts to inform their audiences on antisemitism. \u201cThe challenge to the ADL is to separate the advocacy from the data when it comes to the overall message,\u201d Loeffler said. \u201cI think this is going to be a difficult blow to the credibility to the ADL in its role on this issue. The staff there will continue to do rigorous work, but this will provide an opportunity for self-reflection.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/media/wikipedia-adl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_business_boeings-ceo-responsible", "text": "For all the mistakes and safety problems Boeing has managed under CEO Dave Calhoun\u2019s watch \u2014 resulting in a dozen corporate whistleblowers, multiple groundings and a chunk of a plane\u2019s fuselage literally blowing off in midair \u2014 virtually no one has held him to account. Not Boeing\u2019s board of directors, which has responded by lavishing him with a salary and stock options worth more than $20 million a year, plus a $45 million golden parachute when he retires later this year. Not its customers, aka airlines \u2014 and that\u2019s by design. People often call Boeing and Airbus a duopoly, but that suggests there\u2019s some kind of legit competition happening. Once an airline commits to a tribe, it can\u2019t just switch if it decides the other one is making better planes, because that\u2019d involve a ton of money and time retraining staff who tend to specialize in one or the other. And naturally, we the flying public can cry all we want and it won\u2019t matter a lick to Boeing, because we have even less choice than the airlines to pick the aircraft we fly. Until recently, the government had also been largely snoozing. Calhoun was supposed to be overseeing efforts to reform a safety culture that was so broken, Boeing has acknowledged its lapses led to the deaths of 346 people in two separate crashes in 2018 and 2019. It wasn\u2019t until January 5 this year, when a Boeing jet\u2019s door plug blew off shortly after takeoff, that regulators and lawmakers appeared to snap to attention. Tuesday marked the first time ever that Calhoun has had to testify before lawmakers. He faced an intense grilling, fielding one biting question after the next from both Republican and Democratic senators. Calhoun mostly said the right things: He apologized to families of victims of two 737 Max crashes that took place before he became CEO. In the understatement of the century, he said Boeing is \u201cfar from perfect.\u201d And he acknowledged that the company has a lot of work to do to regain public trust. But when pressed on taking personal responsibility, Calhoun deflected, over and over. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley came in hot, pressing Calhoun about Boeing\u2019s abysmal financial performance, the fact that he got a 45% raise just last year while Boeing\u2019s machinists got 1% over eight years, and why he hasn\u2019t just resigned already. (Calhoun, who announced in the spring that he would retire at the end of 2024, responded that he\u2019s \u201csticking this through.\u201d In one of the more head-scratching moments, Calhoun actually defended Boeing\u2019s culture, saying he was proud of the company\u2019s safety record. \u201cI am proud of every action we have taken,\u201d Calhoun said when pressed by Hawley on how he could possibly be proud of Boeing\u2019s safety culture. Calhoun at one point said, \u201cI believe strongly in accountability.\u201d And yet he was repeatedly unable to provide Senators answers about company policies and actions, including how many whistleblowers it fired and whether the company held any individuals responsible for safety lapses. Near the end of the two-hour hearing, Hawley accused Calhoun of trying to shift blame to Boeing\u2019s employees. \u201cI don\u2019t think the problem\u2019s with the employees, actually, I think the problem\u2019s with you. It\u2019s the C-suite, it\u2019s the management, it\u2019s what you\u2019ve done to this company,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cYour engineers, they\u2019re probably the best in the world, your machinists, they\u2019re outstanding. You\u2019re the problem. And I just hope to God that you don\u2019t destroy this company before it can be saved.\u201d Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal didn\u2019t hold back, either, calling the hearing \u201ca moment of reckoning for Boeing.\u201d \u201cI think that you\u2019ve certainly demonstrated that you can talk about these changes,\u201d Blumenthal told Calhoun. \u201cBut making the changes may well require a different team.\u201d Calhoun may not have been accepting personal responsibility Tuesday, but the government may get the last word, anyway: The Federal Aviation Administration is reviewing Boeing\u2019s recently submitted plans to fix its safety problems. And the Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into the Jan. 5 incident. Tuesday\u2019s hearing put some well deserved fire under Calhoun\u2019s feet. But it seems unlikely that he\u2019ll shoulder any real responsibility for the mess he\u2019s made and the messes he failed to clean up. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what will change as a consequence of this,\u201d Richard Aboulafia, managing partner for AeroDynamic Consultancy, an aerospace advisory firm, told my colleague Chris Isidore. \u201c[Calhoun] needs to go.\u201d Aboulafia said. \u201cHe has shown a strong desire to double down on what\u2019s bad.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/business/boeings-ceo-responsible/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_tech_openai-shuts-down-ai-mayor", "text": "Victor Miller, 42, recently filed paperwork to run for mayor of Cheyenne, Wyoming, but it wasn\u2019t exactly for him: He listed the name of a customized AI chatbot to appear on the ballot. He argued that the chatbot, named VIC \u2013 for \u201cvirtual integrated citizen\u201d \u2013 would use technology from artificial intelligence company OpenAI to make all political decisions and help govern the city. (VIC is not affiliated with a political party.) AI has \u201chelped me in my life personally \u2026 such as helping me with my resume,\u201d Miller told CNN. \u201cI think it could add a layer to help a town. I really want to see that happen.\u201d On Tuesday, however, OpenAI told CNN it shut down Miller\u2019s access to the tool that was being used to interact with and persuade voters. Using ChatGPT in this way, according to the company, is against its policies. AI is making politics even more complicated as government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use AI tools responsibly, and the tech is advancing faster than social, legal and regulatory guardrails. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken action against these uses of our technology for violating our policies against political campaigning,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson told CNN. On its website, OpenAI states it prohibits \u201cengaging in political campaigning or lobbying, including generating campaign materials personalized to or targeted at specific demographics.\u201d Miller said he was motivated to create VIC after he was denied access to city records about policies and procedures because he made his request anonymously. \u201cIf I was able to ask AI and interact with this new intelligence, it would have known the law and I would have gotten the records,\u201d he said. The city did not respond to request for comment on the denial of records, but Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray told CNN in a statement that he is \u201cclosely\u201d monitoring Miller\u2019s bid for mayor. \u201cWyoming law is clear that, to run for office, one must be a \u2018qualified elector,\u2019 which necessitates being a real person,\u201d Gray said in the statement. \u201cTherefore, an AI bot is not a qualified elector.\u201d He also suggested the chatbot is essentially a fig leaf for a Miller candidacy. Gray said he wrote a letter to the Cheyenne municipal clerk raising his concerns about the bid. Although the public-facing version of VIC has been removed by OpenAI, Miller said it still works on his own ChatGPT account. He plans to bring it, along with a microphone, to a local Cheyenne library and give voters the opportunity to directly ask it questions via its voice-to-text feature. OpenAI told CNN it also took action against another candidate in the UK who was using its AI models to help campaign for Parliament. Steve Endacott, chairman of an AI company called Neural Voice, answers questions from voters via AI Steve, a chatbot, on his site. He is running as an independent. Endacott did not respond to a request for comment. His website offered a ChatGPT chatbot where voters were able to leave opinions and help create policies. If a voter asked the tool a question about AI Steve\u2019s policies and it didn\u2019t have an answer, it would conduct a search and create a policy suggestion. (While his website continues to operate, the tool is no longer powered by ChatGPT.) \u2018Gimmick is the right word\u2019 Although AI chatbots are getting smarter, some experts told CNN the technology should never substitute for human judgment in running any part of government. \u201cWhen it comes to AI now and what it will be like in the future, it should never be used to make automated decisions,\u201d said Jen Golbeck, a professor at the College of Information Sciences at the University of Maryland. \u201cAI has always been designed for decision support \u2013 it gives some data to help a human make decisions but is not set up to make decisions by itself.\u201d The emergence of AI political candidates also comes amid growing concerns about how the spread of misinformation could impact elections. Earlier this year, for example, a fake recording of a candidate in Slovakia saying he rigged the election went viral. Golbeck said, however, that there may be a place for AI in politics when it comes to helping with various tasks, such as answering forms from constituents or directing how to get problems solved. \u201cYou may be able to train a chatbot with all of the knowledge found in an office,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the decision making should always be left to humans.\u201d David Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University, agreed, noting the people behind an AI candidacy are leaning into \u201ca cultural moment\u201d and shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously. \u201cGimmick is the right word for it,\u201d Karpf told CNN. \u201cChatGPT is not qualified to run your government.\u201d Karpf said he doesn\u2019t believe lawmakers need to make formal legislation around AI chatbots running for office because \u201cno one is going to vote for an AI chatbot to run a city.\u201d Karpf believes that the timing of these cases is noteworthy, too. \u201cWe have a very serious election coming up, and I don\u2019t mind levity in it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what this is: We should laugh for a minute and get back to work.\u201d But Miller said he hopes the attention around his efforts inspires more AI candidates in the months ahead. \u201cI think this can expand beyond the mayor and Parliament, and [reach the whole] world,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/tech/openai-shuts-down-ai-mayor/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_19_tech_airbnb-whistleblower-complaint-dangerous-organizations-team", "text": "Airbnb has undermined users\u2019 safety by scaling back its work to remove extremists from its platform, a former contractor alleged in a new whistleblower complaint. Jess Hernandez worked full-time as an investigations analyst for Airbnb\u2019s dangerous organizations team from May 2022 to November 2023, researching extremist networks as part of the company\u2019s work to keep dangerous individuals off the platform. But she says she was terminated in November 2023, shortly after her team was directed by management to reinstate users who had been removed for their participation in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. \u201cAirbnb spent much of 2023 scaling back and undermining the work of its team tasked with removing individuals affiliated with dangerous and extremist organizations from the platform,\u201d Whistleblower Aid, the organization representing Hernandez, said in a statement. It added that by making the changes, \u201cAirbnb privately abandoned its public commitment to its hosts\u2019 and guests\u2019 safety and security under this policy.\u201d Hernandez filed the whistleblower disclosure in May to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Trade Commission. The complaint was first reported Wednesday by NBC. CNN has not viewed the complaint and could not independently verify the details included in the NBC report. Airbnb disputed Hernandez\u2019s claims, saying that it continues to enforce against members of dangerous or extremist organizations. \u201cContrary to these baseless and inaccurate allegations, we have actually expanded the remit of our team\u00a0to detect and remove users who pose safety risk\u00a0and this year we\u2019ve hired additional team members to support the enforcement of this policy,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cAs an online platform that\u00a0facilitates millions of real-world interactions globally,\u00a0we have robust policies, processes, and teams across the company focusing on promoting community safety, including preventing unsafe users from using the platform.\u201d Airbnb touts more than 5 million hosts who list space on the room- and home-rental platform. In the first three months of 2024 alone, Airbnb facilitated the booking of more than 132 million nights and \u201cexperiences,\u201d non-overnight offerings such as walking tours. The whistleblower complaint comes as Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky has for years tried to quell safety concerns over a business that is, at its heart, strangers staying in the homes of other strangers. Those efforts have included crackdowns on parties, resources for solo female travelers and a ban on indoor security cameras. Airbnb in 2016 asked members to sign a commitment that they would \u201caccept people regardless of their race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or age\u201d in order to host or make a booking on the platform. And in the following years, it pointed to that pledge when removing users associated with extremist organizations. In 2017, the company removed some accounts and canceled bookings associated with the Unite the Right White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. And in 2021, months after the January 6 attack, Airbnb said it had removed \u201cnumerous individuals\u201d who had been identified as having \u201cparticipated in the violent criminal activity at the US Capitol.\u201d It added that it had canceled reservations in the Washington DC metro area during inauguration week in response to calls from local and federal officials. But in 2023, Airbnb came under fire by conservative media for removing the parents of far-right activist Lauren Southern from the platform; the company quickly reversed the removal, calling it a \u201cmistake.\u201d Southern, a far-right Canadian YouTube personality, had criticized her parents\u2019 removal from the platform on social media and later in an appearance on Fox News. Around the same time, Hernandez claims that Airbnb made the dangerous organizations team\u2019s work slower and more complicated, requiring proposed removals to be reviewed by legal, communications and community policy departments leaders, according to NBC, which said it received Hernandez\u2019s 161-page complaint from an anonymous source on Capitol Hill. \u201cOur hands were tied \u2014 we weren\u2019t removing people,\u201d Hernandez told NBC.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_media_jeff-bezos-will-lewis-washington-post", "text": "Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of The Washington Post, broke his silence Tuesday on the mounting turmoil within his newspaper, expressing support for maintaining high standards at the storied publication as questions swirl over the ethical integrity of its new publisher, Will Lewis. \u201cI know you\u2019ve already heard this from Will, but I wanted to also weigh in directly: the journalistic standards and ethics at The Post will not change,\u201d Bezos said in an email to top newsroom leaders, signaling support for Lewis, though not explicitly. Bezos added in the memo, which was obtained by CNN, that \u201cit can\u2019t be business as usual\u201d at The Post, which has been plagued by financial and audience woes. \u201cThe world is evolving rapidly and we do need to change as a business. With your support, we\u2019ll do that and lead this great institution into the future,\u201d Bezos wrote. \u201cBut, as the newsroom leaders who\u2019ve been shaping and guiding our coverage, you also know our standards at The Post have always been very high. That can\u2019t change \u2014 and it won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cYou have my full commitment on maintaining the quality, ethics, and standards we all believe in,\u201d Bezos added. The memo to The Post\u2019s top personnel comes after serious questions were raised about Lewis, who has been the subject of several explosive reports in recent days that raise questions over whether he is committed to the newspaper\u2019s rigorous journalistic standards. The New York Times\u00a0reported over the weekend\u00a0that, in his Fleet Street days, Lewis assigned an article that was based on stolen phone records. And The Post itself reported in a 3,000-word\u00a0front page story\u00a0Sunday that a \u201cthief\u201d who used deceptive tactics to obtain private material had ties with Lewis\u2019 hand-picked incoming top editor, Robert Winnett. The stories, which landed like a one-two punch in The Post\u2019s newsroom, followed reports that Lewis tried to suppress stories at The Post and NPR about his role cleaning up Rupert Murdoch\u2019s UK phone hacking scandal, when he served as a lieutenant to the right-wing media mogul. Instead of deescalating the situation, Lewis initially lashed out, going so far as to criticize his own media reporters and launch an on-the-record attack aimed at the well-respected NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik, who he referred to as an \u201cactivist, not a journalist.\u201d Lewis later sent a memo to staffers, striking a notably different, non-confrontational tone. But the note did not quell the growing anger within The Post. Inside The Post\u2019s newsroom, morale has plunged in recent months as alarmed staffers express frustration over Lewis\u2019 conduct and worries over the future direction of the newspaper under his leadership. Interviews with nearly a dozen Post staffers and others familiar with the internal dynamics of the newspaper this week revealed a workforce that has grown increasingly dismayed by the situation, with some searching for work elsewhere. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the professor and senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, told CNN on Monday that Bezos should dismiss Lewis. Sonnenfeld, who has advised US presidents and scores of corporate leaders, said that if he were advising Bezos, he would tell him Lewis has \u201clost legitimacy to lead\u201d and it\u2019s time to \u201cclean the house.\u201d \u201cThis is a tragic meltdown of the conscience of American journalism bringing shame to the Katharine Graham, Ben Bradlee, Marty Baron legacy of collaboration, courage, and integrity,\u201d Sonnenfeld said. \u201cBezos must recruit an accomplished, experienced editor whom journalists admire and trust.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/media/jeff-bezos-will-lewis-washington-post/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

Donald Trump\u00a0can\u2019t quit\u00a0Fox News. The Republican presidential candidate may lash out in strong terms at the right-wing channel for supposedly not being sufficiently loyal to him, but a fresh analysis of the content posted on his\u00a0Truth Social\u00a0page shows that he promotes the outlet more than any other. In the month of May, Trump posted 56 videos from Fox News, dwarfing the volume of content he posted from any other outlet, according to the analysis conducted by\u00a0The Righting, a website that monitors right-wing media. In addition to the 56 video clips, Trump posted an additional six articles linking to\u00a0FoxNews.com, for a total of 62 pieces of content from the\u00a0Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch-controlled media organization, according to the analysis, which was provided first to\u00a0Reliable Sources. \u201cThis analysis shows that despite Mr. Trump\u2019s hot and cold relationship with the Fox News Channel, it was clearly his number one choice in May to shower his followers with links to content that he obviously felt were aligned with his messages,\u201d said\u00a0Howard Polskin, president and founder of The Righting. Comparatively, Trump posted 26 video clips from the upstart internet streamer\u00a0Right Side Broadcasting Network, 11 videos from the pro-Trump cable channel\u00a0Newsmax, and 5 from the far-right\u00a0Real America\u2019s Voice. He posted eight links to Real America\u2019s Voice, only three to\u00a0Breitbart, and one to the\u00a0New York Post. Polskin noted that his analysis indicated Trump has a \u201cpreference for fringe outlets like RSBN and Real America\u2019s Voice over more established outlets like the\u00a0Washington Examiner\u00a0and the\u00a0Washington Times.\u201d The Righting analysis also found that, in addition to the content Trump posts from right-wing sources, he also links to mainstream news organizations when it fits his agenda. In May, he linked to the\u00a0Associated Press,\u00a0The New York Times,\u00a0CNN,\u00a0The Washington Post,\u00a0POLITICO,\u00a0NBC News,\u00a0The New Yorker, and\u00a0Reuters. \u201cWhile Trump consistently disparages mainstream or progressive news outlets as \u2018fake news,\u2019 he\u2019ll link to those sources if it shows the Biden campaign or Democrats in a poor light,\u201d Polskin said. Indeed, Polskin\u2019s analysis pulls back the curtain on how Trump works the media. While he has publicly bashed Murdoch and Fox News, in addition to waging an unrelenting war on the press, he continues to promote their content when it fits into the narrative that he is trying to sell his supporters. The warped feedback loop is yet another way in which he exploits the media for his own ends.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/media/donald-trumps-truth-social-media-diet/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

They\u2019re proposing a class action, alleging there are many others in a similar situation. In 2021, then-Disney CEO Bob Chapek announced a move of 2,000 positions from California\u00a0to Florida. But in May 2023, after CEO Bob Iger returned, the company\u00a0canceled the $1 billion Lake Nona office complex\u00a0amid a legal and political battle with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis that has\u00a0since been settled. The plaintiffs, Maria De La Cruz and George Fong, both work for Disney\u2019s product design division. De La Cruz is vice president of product design, and Fong is a creative director, according to the complaint filed by\u00a0Lohr Ripamonti LLP on Tuesday. The lawsuit, which seeks an unspecified amount in damages, has not yet been processed by the Superior Court of Los Angeles. The complaint alleges that Disney misrepresented and concealed\u00a0its\u00a0true plans for the Lake Nona project,\u00a0hurting\u00a0\u2013 financially\u00a0and otherwise \u2013 at least\u00a0250 employees who had made the move from California to Florida. The complaint states employees were informed about the project to relocate 2,000 roles\u00a0to Florida in July of 2021 and that Disney \u201cmade it clear that employees who declined relocation would lose their jobs.\u201d The complaint\u00a0described\u00a0how De La Cruz and Fong sold their homes in Southern California and purchased homes in Central Florida. For Fong, that meant selling\u00a0the\u00a0childhood home that he inherited from his family. After the Lake Nona office project was canceled, De La Cruz\u00a0emailed human\u00a0resources about the future for those who might choose to stay in Florida,\u00a0writing: \u201cAfter all of this, will there be any security in our positions? My fear would be that we decide to stay in Florida, only to be laid off in the next year or so. I don\u2019t want to be punished for being put into a situation my company put me in,\u201d\u00a0the complaint says. The complaint says\u00a0De La Cruz and Fong decided\u00a0to move back to California to keep their jobs, but housing prices in the Lake Nona vicinity had dropped significantly after Disney\u2019s announcement. Fong\u00a0said\u00a0he\u00a0had trouble selling his Florida home, and when he managed to move back to California, mortgage rates and home prices had climbed so rapidly that he was only able to afford a smaller home than he previously had. \u201cMs. De La Cruz, Mr. Fong\u00a0and many others dutifully moved to Florida because they love their jobs, they love the people they work with, and they love Disney,\u201d Attorney Jason Lohr said.

{"id": "business_apple-lawsuit-gender-pay-discrimination", "text": "Two female employees at Apple sued the company on Thursday, alleging the company paid women less than men for the same work. The women are proposing a class action, seeking to represent more than 12,000 current and former female employees in the engineering, marketing and AppleCare divisions. Apple is not the first major tech company to face legal challenges for alleged gender discrimination. Google in 2018 agreed to pay $118 million to settle a class action gender discrimination lawsuit, and Oracle agreed to pay $25 million to settle a class action alleging underpaying female employees. Neither company admitted wrongdoing. The lawsuit centers on Apple\u2019s hiring practices and performance evaluations, which the women allege pushed a wage gap between men and women. California made it illegal for employers to ask job candidates about their prior pay in 2018. Instead, since January 2018, Apple asked about pay expectations, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit alleges that Apple used the pay expectation information to set starting salaries, which had lower pay rates for women compared to men who did similar work. The lawsuit also claims that the performance evaluations are biased against women, because parameters such as teamwork and leadership tend to reward men and punish women. This can affect women\u2019s promotions and bonuses, the lawsuit alleged. Justina Jong, a customer and technical training instructor and one of two plaintiffs, said in a release from her attorneys that she noticed a W-2 left on the office printer by a male colleague. \u201cI noticed that he was being paid almost $10,000 more than me, even though we performed substantially similar work. This revelation made me feel terrible,\u201d Jong said in a statement. The lawsuit also alleges that Jong was forced to work in a hostile work environment next to a co-worker who had sexually harassed her. The other plaintiff, Amina Salgado, said she complained to Apple numerous times about the wage gap, according to the lawsuit. Salgado has worked in several roles for Apple since 2012, according to the suit. Eventually, she said, Apple hired a third-party firm to conduct an investigation, which found that she was paid less. \u201cAs a result of the third-party investigation, in late 2023, Apple increased Ms. Salgado\u2019s compensation prospectively, but failed and refused to pay Ms. Salgado back pay for the years during which she was paid less than men performing substantially similar work,\u201d the lawsuit alleged. The lawsuit claims the class members are entitled to compensation from the loss of fair wages, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.

{"id": "2024_06_19_business_boeing-families-lawsuit", "text": "Families that lost loved ones in two Boeing 737 Max crashes said on Wednesday that the company committed the \u201cdeadliest corporate crime in US history\u201d and asked the Justice Department to fine the company the maximum $24 billion it could face in a criminal trial. The families wrote to the Department of Justice asking for the fine as the US government considers criminal prosecution of Boeing. The Justice Department said last month that Boeing\u2019s recent string of safety lapses and mishaps constituted a violation of its 2021 agreement that allowed the company to avoid charges for 737 Max crashes in Indonesia in October 2018 and in Ethiopia in March 2019 that killed 346 people. The \u201cappropriate action now is an aggressive criminal prosecution\u201d against Boeing including a quick jury trial and \u201ccriminal prosecutions of the responsible corporate officials,\u201d including former CEO Dennis Muilenburg, the families\u2019 attorney wrote. \u201cBecause time is of the essence to avoid any statute of limitations from running (out), the Department should begin these prosecutions promptly,\u201d they wrote in the 32-page letter, which was sent by Paul Cassell, an attorney representing the families. The letter also asks the Justice Department for an independent corporate monitor to oversee Boeing\u2019s safety measures and to direct it in its efforts to improve its quality. Boeing did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. In May, the Department of Justice notified Boeing that it had breached terms of\u00a0its\u00a02021 agreement following a January incident in which a\u00a0door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines flight\u00a0shortly after takeoff in January. The Justice Department said in its letter that it has not yet determined how it will proceed and Boeing had the opportunity to respond to its breach of the agreement \u2013 and steps it has taken to remediate the situation \u2013 by last week. The DOJ said it will let the court know by July 7 how it will proceed. Boeing, in a previous statement, said it has upheld its end of the bargain. \u201cWe believe that we have honored the terms of that agreement, and look forward to the opportunity to respond to the Department on this issue,\u201d the company said. \u201cAs we do so, we will engage with the Department with the utmost transparency, as we have throughout the entire term of the agreement.\u201d On Tuesday, current Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun testified before both Republican and Democratic senators. He apologized to families of victims of the two 737 Max crashes that took place before he became CEO and admitted that Boeing is \u201cfar from perfect.\u201d He also acknowledged that the company has a lot of work to do to regain public trust. The 2021 deferred prosecution agreement that Boeing reached with the Justice Department was harshly criticized by the family members and some members of Congress at that time. Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion, but most of that money - $1.77 billion \u2013 was paid to the airlines that owned the grounded planes, money that Boeing had already agreed to pay. It also agreed to set up a $500 million fund to compensate family members, which it had also already agreed to do in the face of lawsuits, and it would have paid a $244 million fine to the federal government. The $24 billion, as significant as it would be, would still be less than the $31.9 billion in core operating losses it has reported since the second crash of the plane in 2019 resulted in a 20-month grounding of its best-selling jet. Boeing has identified more than $20 billion in direct costs from that grounding, and that doesn\u2019t count the tens of billions in lost sales revenue and increased interest costs as its debt soared to cover its losses. Nor does it include the costs incurred since the January 5 Alaska Airlines incident in which a door plug blew off a 737 Max and the FAA put limits on its rate of production due to new questions about the safety and quality of its planes. \u2013CNN\u2019s Evan Perez contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/business/boeing-families-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

All stocks listed in France are now worth about $3.13 trillion in total, compared with $3.18 trillion for all shares listed in the United Kingdom,\u00a0Bloomberg reported Monday, based on the data it had compiled. On Tuesday, the CAC All-Share index in Paris was still marginally bigger than London\u2019s FTSE equivalent, but the latter only accounts for 98% of the market value of UK-listed shares. London\u2019s comeback as Europe\u2019s biggest equity market is \u201cmostly\u201d the result of French President Emmanuel Macron calling snap elections for June 9 after his party was trounced by the French far right in a vote for European Union lawmakers, according to Axel Rudolph, a senior market analyst at trading platform IG Group. \u201cFinancial markets don\u2019t like uncertainty, and the fact that you\u2019ve had such a shift to the right in the French European elections has led people to worry (about what comes next),\u201d he told CNN. Since June 9, the CAC 40 of leading French stocks has shed more than 5% of its value \u2014\u00a0equivalent to $160 billion \u2014\u00a0as investors ponder the prospect of the far-right National Rally playing a much bigger role in the parliament of Europe\u2019s second-largest economy. The first round of the French elections is scheduled for June 30, followed by a second round on July 7. An opinion poll by research firm OpinionWay released Friday showed that 32% of respondents intended to vote for the National Rally in the first round, 25% for a coalition of left-wing parties, and 19% for Macron\u2019s centrist party. French banking stocks have fared particularly badly since Macron called the elections. Shares in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale have tumbled\u00a0nearly 14%, while shares in BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole have fallen 10.6% and 11.2% respectively. Hubert\u00a0de Barochez, a senior market economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said investors might be concerned that a parliament run by the National Rally would penalize banks. \u201cGenerally, quite populist governments attack banks and their proceeds\u2026 (There) might be fears about additional taxes on banks,\u201d he told CNN. Another reason for the rout in French banking stocks is the fact that \u201cbanks own quite a lot of the country\u2019s public debt,\u201d he added. The prices of those government bonds have fallen since June 9, driving up their yields or interest rates demanded by investors as they see a higher risk in holding the debt. A parliament dominated by the far right could make it harder to reduce France\u2019s huge government debt pile, equal to 110.6% of gross domestic product at the end of last year, and could even add to it. A bitterly divided assembly would also struggle to cut the budget deficit \u2014 the gap between government spending and tax receipts \u2014 which\u00a0reached 5.5%\u00a0of GDP last year. In contrast with the political and financial turmoil in France, UK financial markets are \u201crelatively stable,\u201d said Rudolph at IG Group. The UK is gearing up for its own general election on July 4, which the opposition Labour Party is predicted to win by a wide margin. In addition, now that uncertainty surrounding Brexit has subsided and Britain has come out of a short recession, investors are snapping up stocks in UK companies, attracted by their low valuations compared with US stocks, Rudolph added. Similarly, Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, an investment platform, wrote in a note Tuesday: \u201cThere are increasing signs that the UK is gaining some favor among overseas investors, given its mix of stable, cash-generative companies which are cheap by comparison (with French stocks) by historic standards.\u201d On the other side of the English Channel, the National Rally has promised to raise public spending and slash VAT on electricity and fuel if it comes to power. Credit ratings agencies are already keeping a close eye on France, one of the EU\u2019s three most-indebted countries. Last month, S&P\u00a0downgraded\u00a0the country\u2019s long-term credit score and said it expected its budget deficit to narrow to 3.5% of GDP in 2027, well above the 2.9% targeted by the current\u00a0government. Mohit Kumar, chief economist for Europe at Jefferies, an investment bank, wrote in a note Tuesday: \u201cOur view on France remains that yes, we should be worried about the debt and deficit picture\u2026 We do not see French deficit coming below 3% over the next five-year horizon.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/investing/london-overtakes-paris-stock-index/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_business_uk-millionaires-loss-record", "text": "A record number of millionaires could leave the United Kingdom this year as political turmoil and the potential for higher taxes under a future Labour government reduce the appeal of what was once among the top destinations for the rich. As many as 9,500 people with at least $1 million in liquid, investable assets, will leave the country, more than double the number that left in 2023, according to provisional estimates contained in a report Tuesday by migration advisers Henley & Partners. \u201cThese figures reflect a steady accumulation of factors detracting from the UK\u2019s appeal to high-net-worth individuals,\u201d Hannah White, CEO of the Institute for Government, wrote in the report. \u201cThe hangover from Brexit continues to be felt, with the City of London no longer seen as the financial center of the world.\u201d The report is based on data on 150,000 high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) tracked by investment firm New World Wealth. The firm only counts people who stay in their new country more than half of the year, and focuses primarily on company founders, chairs, CEOs, presidents, directors and managing partners. The continuing exodus from the UK \u2014 16,500 millionaires left between 2017 and 2023 \u2014 is part of a global mass migration of the rich that appears to be accelerating. The Henley Private Wealth Migration report found that 128,000 millionaires are set to relocate this year, beating last year\u2019s record by 8,000. \u201cAs the world grapples with a perfect storm of geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainty and social upheaval, millionaires are voting with their feet in record numbers,\u201d Dominic Volek, head of private clients at Henley & Partners, said in a press release. Of the 15 places with most resident millionaires, the UK is suffering more than most \u2014 only China will lose more HNWIs (15,200) in 2024 \u2014 and it\u2019s one of just three locations, alongside Japan and Hong Kong, to have seen a net loss in the decade since 2013, according to the report. By contrast, the ranks of the wealthy have grown in the US, Canada, Australia, Germany and France over the same period. The impact of Brexit, which ended the free movement of people between the UK and the European Union as well as raising new barriers to trade and investment, and other economic shocks such as the war in Ukraine and the ensuing energy price spike, has been compounded by a period of unprecedented political uncertainty. The UK has had five prime ministers since 2010, including the 45-day tenure of Liz Truss in 2022, when her plan to jack up government borrowing to slash taxes sent the pound crashing to a record low against the dollar and forced the Bank of England to intervene to prevent a financial crisis. Such instability has made it much harder for policymakers to address the country\u2019s anemic economic growth and foster a better climate for investment. Now there\u2019s a new risk on the horizon. Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour Party, which is leading Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s Conservatives by a margin of about 20% in opinion polls, has gone out of its way to woo business and investors, and to promise economic stability and stronger growth if it wins the upcoming election on July 4. Starmer and his finance spokesperson Rachel Reeves, who previously worked at the Bank of England, have promised not to increase income tax or sales tax \u2014 and to stick with fiscal rules adopted by Sunak\u2019s government. But Labour is committed to targeted tax increases that could hit the rich. It wants to remove a 20% tax break from private schools to fund new teachers in the state sector, close remaining loopholes that allow so-called non-dom residents to protect some of their foreign earnings from tax and raise more money from private equity firms. \u201cThe outflow of high-net-worth individuals already generated by the economic and political context is now being accelerated by policy decisions ahead of the election,\u201d said White. Still, one very rich couple will apparently be staying, whatever the result on July 4. Sunak, a millionaire former hedge fund manager, and his wife Akshata Murty \u2014 the daughter of an Indian tech billionaire \u2014 are worth \u00a3651 million ($826 million), according to The Sunday Times Rich List, making them richer than King Charles. Sunak said last week he would serve a full term if re-elected as member of parliament in his northern England constituency, even if his party is kicked out of government.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/business/uk-millionaires-loss-record/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_economy_uk-inflation-target-interest-rate-cuts", "text": "UK inflation slowed to 2% in May, falling to the Bank of England\u2019s target for the first time in nearly three years as food price rises eased sharply. The consumer price data published Wednesday means the United Kingdom is now ahead of most other G7 economies in bringing inflation back to the level central bankers try to maintain to help households and businesses. But the figures also showed that the prices of services, such as haircuts, hotels and restaurants, are still rising too fast. That suggests the Bank of England won\u2019t follow the European Central Bank in cutting interest rates when it meets Thursday. A rate cut in August, when UK policymakers meet next, is now also less likely. Services inflation, at 5.7% last month, down from 5.9% in April, is \u201cstill running too hot,\u201d said Zara Noakes, global market analyst at JPMorgan Asset Management. \u201cToday\u2019s inflation news puts the final nail in the coffin for any hopes of a rate cut from the Bank of England tomorrow\u2026 If this stickiness in domestic price pressures continues, alongside ongoing resilience in economic activity, an August rate cut could well be off the table too,\u201d she added. Other economists, including analysts at Nomura, thought an August rate cut was still possible if pay rises and the price of services cooled further. \u201cFor an August rate cut, we will need other economic news to play ball,\u201d the analysts wrote in a note. Following a long-running campaign to tame soaring inflation, the Bank of England hiked benchmark borrowing costs to 5.25% last August \u2014 their highest level in 16 years and where they have stayed since. UK inflation peaked at 11.1% in October 2022, driven to a 41-year high by surging food and energy costs. While it has been easing steadily since \u2014 and wages have now grown faster than prices for close to a year \u2014 many Brits are still struggling to pay their bills. Persistently high living costs are likely to be top of mind for voters when they elect a new government on July 4. \u201cWorkers now have more money in their pockets than they did last year\u2026 But the bad news is that most people are feeling poorer than when they voted in the last general election nearly five years ago,\u201d said Rebecca Florisson, principal analyst at the Work Foundation at Lancaster University in England. \u201cFor many workers the cost-of-living crisis is not over yet.\u201d According to Jake Finney, an economist at PwC UK, consumer prices have risen by 20% since inflation was last at target in July 2021. He cautioned that headline inflation could pop back above the 2% target as soon as next month if prices continued to rise at their current pace. \u201cIt is not \u2018job done\u2019 yet,\u201d he said. Similarly to the United Kingdom, inflation has also proven surprisingly stubborn in the United States and Europe, prompting traders to scale back expectations for interest rate cuts from major central banks. Although the European Central Bank cut rates earlier this month, it raised its inflation forecast for this year and said consumer prices in the 20 countries that use the euro were likely to stay above its 2% target well into next year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/economy/uk-inflation-target-interest-rate-cuts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_media_jeff-bezos-washington-post-publisher-dilemma", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Jeff Bezos\u00a0has a decision to make \u2014 and it is one that will determine the future course of one of the nation\u2019s most prestigious news organizations. The\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0owner and\u00a0Amazon\u00a0billionaire can continue to stand by\u00a0Will Lewis, the controversy plagued\u00a0Fleet Street\u00a0veteran he tapped as publisher and chief executive of the iconic national broadsheet. Or he can side with his\u00a0Pulitzer Prize-winning newsroom, which is repudiating their new leader in clear and unmistakable terms. But based on conversations with CNN on Monday with nearly a dozen staffers and others familiar with the internal dynamics of The Post, it appears increasingly unlikely that Bezos can have it both ways. Lewis, who continues to face heavy scrutiny over a series of troubling decisions both past and present, has unquestionably lost the room, alienating staffers and creating an untenable position in which it is difficult to see him effectively leading the respected army of reporters under his command. There may have been a moment in which the former\u00a0Rupert Murdoch\u00a0lieutenant could have turned the tide and quelled the uproar within The Post. That fury first saw life shortly after his decision to oust top editor\u00a0Sally Buzbee. In the wake of her sudden exit, it was revealed that he tried to suppress stories at The Post and\u00a0NPR\u00a0about his role cleaning up the\u00a0U.K. phone hacking scandal for Murdoch (which he denies wrongdoing in). Instead of deescalating the situation early on, Lewis lashed out, going so far as to criticize his own media reporters and launch an on-the-record attack aimed at the well-respected NPR media correspondent\u00a0David Folkenflik. And while Lewis later sent the newsroom an apologetic memo following the episodes, it did little to quell concerns, setting into motion a series of stories that have raised serious questions about his judgment and journalistic values, as well as those of his hand-picked future top editor,\u00a0Robert Winnett. The New York Times\u00a0reported over the weekend\u00a0that, in his Fleet Street days, Lewis assigned an article that was based on stolen phone records. And The Post\u00a0reported Sunday that\u00a0a \u201cthief\u201d who used deceptive tactics to obtain private material had ties with Winnett. The stories landed like a one-two punch in The Post newsroom, raising even more alarm and upping the panic level at the newspaper to new heights. Incensed, anxious, and demoralized staffers stressed to CNN on Monday that they just want Bezos to bring this \u201cshit show,\u201d as one staffer put it, to an end. When Bezos first appointed Lewis, staffers at The Post understood that he needed to appoint a publisher and chief executive who would shake things up in the newsroom. They acknowledged to CNN that, under previous boss\u00a0Fred Ryan, The Post had fallen behind outlets like The Times in the post-Donald Trump\u00a0years, both from audience and financial standpoints. And so, when Lewis took the reins in January, the newsroom was more or less, cautiously optimistic about how he would transform the institution. They were willing to give him a chance. But they\u2019re not willing to let him shred the newspaper\u2019s reputation in the process. While the journalists continue to worry about the financial state of their newsroom and want a boss who can seriously address its business woes, they fiercely guard its editorial independence and integrity. And, with respect to that, they strongly believe Lewis and Winnett pose a significant danger. \u201cWe are losing audience and money and the top of the company is a clown show,\u201d a staffer explained to CNN, adding, \u201cAll we have is our credibility and we\u2019ve just taken a gun to that.\u201d The newspaper\u2019s credibility, of course, is inextricably linked to whether it can be a thriving business. Good luck getting people to subscribe to a newspaper that they believe has been ethically compromised. (I would love to see that sales pitch!) And, as one staffer at The Post noted to CNN, behaving in an ethical manner matters greatly when trying to convince a newsroom to reinvent itself. As the person said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how good your ideas are if you have a no-confidence vote from your entire staff.\u201d That said, what Bezos will decide to do as he assesses the situation at The Post remains a mystery. Questions to his spokesperson went unanswered on Monday. And an email sent directly to Bezos went unreturned. But certainly, the tech baron is aware of the rapidly deteriorating situation over on\u00a0K Street. And, presumably, Bezos does not want his stewardship of The Post to be stained by an ugly chapter in which he allowed grave problems to fester and eat away at the institution as he sat idly by. Dismissing Lewis would bring with it some pain for Bezos, sure. It would require him to concede that he got it wrong with Lewis and restart the time-consuming process of finding another publisher. And it might cost him a nice chunk of change \u2014 though an irrelevant one for someone of Bezos\u2019 wealth \u2014 to pay out Lewis\u2019 contract. But keeping Lewis in the position could deliver an even greater level of pain and, with it, unflattering headlines over time. More stories about Lewis are sure to drop in the days and weeks ahead. Top talent may soon head for the exits (indeed, I\u2019m told some staffers are already looking for work elsewhere). And at some point it becomes hard to see how Bezos justifies having a boss oversee a newspaper that is publishing A1 stories spotlighting his ethically-challenged decisions. The best advice in crisis public relations is to reach to the end result as quickly as possible, to avoid an unrelenting drip-drip of bad news. Bezos can surely do the math on this one, given it is not too complicated. And perhaps that is why his camp is not voicing public support for Lewis. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the renowned professor and senior associate dean for leadership studies at the\u00a0Yale School of Management, told CNN on Monday that Bezos has a simple decision to make. Sonnenfeld, who has advised U.S. presidents and scores of corporate leaders, said that if he were advising Bezos, he would tell him Lewis has \u201clost legitimacy to lead\u201d and it\u2019s time to \u201cclean the house.\u201d \u201cThis is a tragic meltdown of the conscience of American journalism bringing shame to the\u00a0Katharine Graham,\u00a0Ben Bradlee,\u00a0Marty Baron\u00a0legacy of collaboration, courage and integrity,\u201d Sonnenfeld said. \u201cBezos must recruit an accomplished, experienced editor whom journalists admire and trust.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/media/jeff-bezos-washington-post-publisher-dilemma/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

Documents newly obtained by CNN detail that Boeing warned Southwest Airlines and American Airlines of the potential problem in February and both airlines in turn sent alerts to their respective pilot groups. \u201cBoeing has received two reports of CFM LEAP-1B engine failures following large bird strikes on takeoff and initial climb,\u201d said the alert to American Airlines pilots.

{"id": "2024_06_13_business_faa-boeing-oversight-too-hands-off", "text": "Federal Aviation Administration chief Mike Whitaker said his agency is partly responsible for the safety problems at Boeing, admitting that it had been \u201ctoo hands off\u201d in its oversight of the troubled aircraft manufacturer. In testimony Thursday before the Senate Commerce Committee, Whitaker said that his agency now had far more inspectors on the ground at Boeing factories and the factory of its primary supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. He said it will continue to push Boeing to improve its safety culture in the wake of the January 5 incident in which a door plug blew off during an Alaska Airlines flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the Boeing 737 Max. But he also said that the FAA was not blameless in that incident. \u201cLet me also acknowledge the FAA should have had much better visibility into what was happening at Boeing before January 5,\u201d he said in his opening remarks to the committee. \u201cThe FAA\u2019s approach was too hands off, too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections. We have changed that approach over the last several months. And those changes are permanent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have now moved to a more active, comprehensive oversight model - the audit plus inspection approach.\u201d Whitaker, who was confirmed to his job heading the nation\u2019s primary aviation regulator in October, said he will be visiting Boeing\u2019s South Carolina factory himself tomorrow, and its plant that makes the 737 Max in Renton, Washington in September. Whitaker said that the FAA previously had 24 inspectors at Boeing and Spirit and that the number was in the low 30s now. Its target is 55 inspectors, although he did not give a date for when that would be in place. And he said that number could change over time. \u201cWe can no longer afford to remain reactive,\u201d he said. A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board has found that bolts necessary to keep the door plug on the Alaska Air plane in place were missing from the plane at the time it left the Boeing factory in Washington roughly two months before the flight. Under questions at Thursday\u2019s hearing, Whitaker said the FAA did not have any inspectors in the factories at that time when the piece was put in. Instead the FAA staff was focused on paperwork audits instead of actual inspections. \u201cWe clearly did not have enough folks to see what was going on in that factory,\u201d he said. Safety experience\u2026 in the dairy industry But finding the inspectors could be a problem. Sen. Maria Cantwell, the Washington Democrat who is chair of the committee, questioned the backgrounds of some of the safety inspectors. \u201cI\u2019m definitely hearing \u2018We don\u2019t have enough aviation inspectors.\u2019 And \u2018We don\u2019t even have enough qualified instructors at schools,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cOne story I heard was that they said, \u2018Yes, I have safety experience. But it\u2019s in the dairy industry.\u2019 We need an aviation inspector on the floor who has aviation experience, not just safety experience.\u201d Whitaker responded that while the agency is having to provide some training for new hires, it is finding the experienced inspectors it needs for Boeing. \u201cWith respect to Boeing, we\u2019re putting our most experienced and best people on this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly the most important issue we\u2019re dealing with right now.\u201d But for years the FAA has relied on employees of Boeing and other manufacturers to inspect their own companies, then report to the FAA, under what is known as \u201cdelegation of authority.\u201d That structure is still in place, even with more FAA employees now on the floor at Boeing factories. That reliance on self-inspection and self-certification first started getting attention in 2019 after two fatal crashes of the 737 Max killed 346 people and led to a 20-month grounding of the plane. The fact that much of the certification of the Max, a relatively new aircraft, was done by Boeing employees, not FAA staff, raised questions in Congress and an outcry among families of some of the crash victims. In January, after the Alaska Air flight, Whitaker joined those who suggested the process needed to be changed. \u201cIt is time to re-examine the delegation of authority and assess any associated safety risks,\u201d said Whitaker a week after the incident. \u201cThe grounding of the 737-9 and the multiple production-related issues identified in recent years require us to look at every option to reduce risk.\u201d In February the FAA gave Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to improve safety. And in late May when the plan was submitted, the FAA announced it was leaving a limit on production levels in place until safety improves. \u201cThere must be a fundamental shift in the company\u2019s safety culture in order to holistically address its quality and safety challenges,\u201d Whitaker said on Thursday. \u201cThis is about systemic change, and there\u2019s a lot of work to be done.\u201d But he said there has been a shift in tone in discussions between the FAA and Boeing executives since the January incident. \u201cMy focus has been on making it clear this is a very long-term journey. You don\u2019t change the culture of an organization. We\u2019ve seen an increasing recognition that this is a long journey ahead.\u201d Boeing also said it has made significant changes since January. \u201cWe listened to our employees, engaged transparently with our regulator, welcomed the findings and recommendations from the FAA \u2026. and invited scrutiny from customers and independent experts,\u201d it said in a statement when asked for a comment on Thursday\u2019s hearing. \u201cWe will work under the FAA\u2019s oversight and uphold our responsibility to the flying public to continue delivering safe, high-quality airplanes.\u201d  This story has been updated with additional reporting and context.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/business/faa-boeing-oversight-too-hands-off/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security", "text": "The Federal Trade Commission is investigating TikTok for its data and security practices, two sources told CNN on the condition of anonymity. The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_business_netflix-house-locations-experiential-venues", "text": "Netflix is opening massive entertainment venues in two cities that it says will allow fans to immerse themselves in the worlds of their favorite shows. The \u201cexperiential\u201d complexes, called Netflix Houses, will include elaborate events, themed gift shops and restaurants. In a repurposing of empty retail space, the houses will occupy former department store locations at Dallas Galleria and King of Prussia mall (near Philadelphia). Both will span more than 100,000 square feet and are set to open in 2025, according to the streaming giant. It\u2019s Netflix\u2019s TV tweak on a theme park. For fans of its \u201cSquid Game\u201d dark drama and related reality show, for example, Netflix promises to recreate the program\u2019s Glass Bridge challenge. Competitors walk or jump across clear panels that shatter \u2014 and drop them \u2014 if they stand on the wrong one. It\u2019s a risky move. Critics of the expansion note that attracting repeat business will be challenging. \u201cOne of the keys to success will be to keep the offer refreshed, so that it keeps people coming back to what\u2019s new,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData. Netflix has already had considerable success with elaborate touring productions and events tied to some of its higher-profile programming. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is currently hosting a tour of \u201cBridgerton\u201d High Tea; Toronto has a \u201cKnives Out\u201d dinner party; and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil offers an immersive \u201cStranger Things\u201d experience. Risks and rewards All this is not a new idea, though. \u201cDisney has monetized its content for years and has a very successful retail business through licensing, its own stores, and shop-in-shop concepts,\u201d said Saunders. For Netflix, it\u2019s just the latest move in a series of efforts to broaden its profile and income beyond standard streaming\u2014 even though the bulk of its profits have come from its core business. These new initiatives come at a time profits in the streaming industry are getting squeezed. So the company has cut back on creating original programming but has expanded its video game offerings, rolling out mobile-friendly games from the \u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d franchise. In a brand extension, It also partnered with Williams Sonoma on a line of \u201cBridgerton\u201d-themed dinnerware, paper goods, foods and linens. TikTok influencer, product reviewer and \u201cBridgerton\u201d fan Carrie Berk, who has twice attended \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Ball\u201d said she thinks Netflix\u2019s new venture will be met with success. (She was not compensated by Netflix or given tickets to the events.) \u201cI think that it\u2019s brilliant that Netflix is bringing that magic IRL!\u201d she said. (IRL stands for \u201cin real life.\u201d) For years, \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Ball\u201d has been staged in various cities two or three times daily. Fans could enjoy dances and watch performances by violin players and acrobats dressed in historically accurate garb under chandelier lighting. In keeping with the show\u2019s plot, the Queen named a \u201cDiamond of the Season\u201d at each performance. Social media influencers were invited to write a letter and make their case for why they should be chosen, illustrating Netflix\u2019s keen interest in the social media world. Now, \u201cNetflix House represents the next generation of our distinctive offerings,\u201d said Netflix Chief Marketing Officer Marian Lee, in a statement. \u201cThe venues will bring our beloved stories to life in new ever-changing, and unexpected ways.\u201d Berk agreed and told CNN of her experience, \u201cIt really made me feel like I stepped into the world of the show.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/business/netflix-house-locations-experiential-venues/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. At least one interest rate cut is still on the table for 2024, but in the short term, higher US borrowing costs are here to stay. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday held rates steady for the seventh consecutive time and penciled in just one cut this year, down from the three it first projected last December. Recent economic data has encouraged investors that inflation is cooling again after showing signs of sticking earlier this year. The Consumer and Producer Price Index reports for May both came in softer than expected this week, helping lead stocks to record highs. Still, traders are widely expecting the central bank to keep rates where they are again in July. If the Fed does indeed hold off on changes, interest rates will stay at their current 23-year high until at least September. How should traders invest in a higher-for-longer rate environment? Before the Bell spoke with Wylie Tollette, chief investment officer at Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Before the Bell: What do higher-for-longer rates mean for the stock market? The stock market is always forward-looking, and I think the market may have already priced in the fewer rate cuts [before the Fed meeting]. As we\u2019ve seen throughout the year, the expectation for rate cuts has been steadily declining. What I find interesting and actually kind of invigorating is the resilience of the US economy in the face of these expected higher-for-longer rates. I think that we expected, consistent with most financial economists and investors, higher rates to really begin biting the economy more quickly and more significantly last year. As it turns out, I think our new hypothesis, based on everything we\u2019ve seen, is that these higher-for-longer rates are really just a return to a more normal rate environment, sort of a pre-global financial crisis rate environment. Which stocks could perform poorly due to higher-for-longer rates? There will be some sectors that higher-for-longer rates will impact. And we\u2019ve already seen some of them. For example, real estate. Most real estate is financed. Commercial real estate in particular, offices and retail, I think will continue to suffer. We\u2019ve seen that already, and I think there\u2019s probably still some more pain to come. Another area like cars, the big purchases that many consumers finance. Obviously, higher-for-longer rates makes that financing more expensive. And so we can see consumer durables slowing down or suffering a little bit in this higher-for-longer rate environment. In general, smaller-cap stocks, most regardless of sector, will probably have a harder time in this environment right now. What about stocks that could perform well in a higher-rate environment? Semiconductors, those we think will continue to do well. They\u2019ve almost become the new defensives because they have so much cash on their balance sheet. They don\u2019t rely on financing to finance their internal growth and investment, and their demand cycles aren\u2019t terribly sensitive to higher interest rates. And we\u2019ve seen that already priced into a lot of Big Tech. The Magnificent Seven, we actually continue to see pretty strong growth prospects for those companies in the face of higher rates. Energy and materials traditionally do reasonably well in higher-for-longer rates. We\u2019ve seen utilities rally. We actually think that could continue. There\u2019s just a lot of demand for electricity with electric vehicles and artificial intelligence. We see utilities needing to increase supply and really being under pressure to do that, which provides an interesting and perhaps a rare opportunity to actually benefit and see some real growth in the utility sector. Unhappy workers may reduce global GDP by as much as 9%, Gallup estimates Employees\u2019 negative daily emotions and lack of well-being can ultimately hurt worker engagement \u2014 and the economy, according to a new report released this week. Gallup, in its \u201cState of the Global Workplace,\u201d estimates that low employee engagement costs the global economy $8.9 trillion, or 9% of global GDP, reports my colleague Jeanne Sahadi. The report includes findings from its latest annual World Poll, which surveyed 128,278 employees in more than 140 countries last year. That poll found that roughly 20% of workers globally reported feeling lonely, angry or sad on a daily basis. And 41% on average say they feel stress. Those most likely to say they feel lonely were younger workers (22%), employees who worked remotely full-time (25%) and those who felt most disengaged on the job (31%). While work isn\u2019t always the cause of a person\u2019s negative daily emotions, employers should still be concerned. That\u2019s because work can either improve or worsen employees\u2019 well-being. On the one hand, the Gallup report noted, \u201cwhen employees find their work and work relationships meaningful, employment is associated with high levels of daily enjoyment and low levels of all negative daily emotions. Notably, half of employees who are engaged at work are thriving in life overall.\u201d On the other, researchers found that being disengaged at work can negatively affect a person\u2019s wellbeing as much as \u2014 or more than \u2014 not having a job at all. \u201cEmployees who dislike their jobs tend to have high levels of daily stress and worry, as well as elevated levels of all other negative emotions,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOn many wellbeing items (stress, anger, worry, loneliness), being actively disengaged at work is equivalent to or worse than being unemployed.\u201d Read more here.

{"id": "2024_06_13_economy_biden-nominates-new-fdic-head", "text": "President Joe Biden has nominated Christy Goldsmith Romero as chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The announcement comes after current FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg said he intended to resign once a successor is confirmed by the Senate following a scathing independent investigation detailing pervasive sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying at the agency charged with regulating the banking sector. Goldsmith Romero, a Democrat, served as special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program at the Treasury Department that was borne out of the Great Recession. In that role, she was responsible for overseeing efforts to crack down on banks\u2019 misuse of funds they received from the program. In a statement released Thursday, the White House said Goldsmith Romero \u201chas more than 20 years of experience as a career federal attorney and leader in financial regulation, serving under four Presidents\u201d and touted her experience promoting \u201cfinancial stability and market resiliency, integrity, and vibrancy.\u201d An agency under scrutiny She also has the advantage of having been unanimously confirmed by the Senate twice for previous positions, which may improve her odds of getting confirmed a third time. That contributed to why Biden chose to nominate her, a person familiar with the matter told C\ufeffNN. Republican and Democratic senators were briefed on Biden\u2019s intent to nominate her prior to Thursday\u2019s announcement, they added. As incoming head of the FDIC, she will largely be viewed as the figure responsible for fixing the longstanding problematic culture at the agency. Goldsmith Romero was picked instead of promoting someone internally at the FDIC because there was a general sense that it would take someone perceived as having a clean slate to usher in lasting change, the person said. An independent investigation commissioned by the FDIC released in early May confirmed the Wall Street Journal\u2019s reporting from last year. Among the findings were many women receiving sexually explicit messages as well as unwanted advances from male coworkers who were often in more senior roles. Minorities and women reported being passed over for promotions. A Hispanic employee said they were \u201casked by a colleague to recite the Pledge of Allegiance to prove that they were American.\u201d Many FDIC employees who partook in the investigation expressed a fear of retaliation for speaking out against alleged misconduct in addition to a lack of disciplinary actions taken against wrongdoers. Gruenberg\u2019s exit Under pressure from the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Gruenberg announced he would vacate the position once a new chair is confirmed. The move drew sharp rebuke from Republicans, who viewed it as politically motivated because if Gruenberg resigned immediately then Vice Chair Travis Hill, a Republican appointee, would have automatically become chair. That would have left the agency deadlocked with one other Republican and two Democrat members on the FDIC\u2019s board of directors, which would likely prevent controversial banking regulations, such as ramped-up capital requirements, from taking effect.

{"id": "2024_06_18_food_subway-dippers-sidekick-expansion", "text": "Subway\u2019s footlong cookies were so popular they had a shortage. Now, the chain is hoping to replicate that success with savory new companions. Beginning Tuesday, three new 12-inch long additions are arriving, called Dippers. They use Subway\u2019s flatbread, rolled up with pepperoni and cheese, chicken and cheese or double cheese, and served hot. The $3 rollups are part of its Sidekicks menu, adding to its successful lineup of giant cookies, churros and soft pretzels. Value is a major factor in the expansion of Sidekicks. Many fast food chains are releasing new menu items and discounts to lure back cash-strapped consumers, especially\u00a0low-income consumers who are dining out less often and\u00a0spending less when they do. Sidekicks and Dippers were born out of the chain seeing younger customers\u2019 preference for snacking, according to Douglas\u00a0Fry, Subway\u2019s North America president, who said they want \u201cconvenient, hand-held, grab-and-go\u201d food at an affordable price. \u201cWe know that the economic climate has started to shift,\u201d Fry told CNN. He observed that customers have \u201cbeen sacrificing quantity and quality,\u201d and that Subway offers a \u201cgreat value proposition of great-tasting food that\u2019s made fresh and is available for a variety of budgets.\u201d Dippers are a cost-efficient addition for Subway, using existing ingredients like flatbread from its recently unveiled wraps lineup and the meats and cheeses already used in its sandwiches. Subway\u2019s\u00a0new Sidekicks lineup is a key part of its turnaround plans, which includes a number of other changes to its menus as part of its efforts to keep up with rivals. Since the January launch, Fry said the chain has sold more than 30 million snacks, priced from $2 to $5, and \u201cprobably would have sold more\u201d if it wasn\u2019t for the cookie shortage. The addition of Sidekicks \u201cmakes sense,\u201d said David Henkes, senior principal at Technomic, previously telling CNN that Subway needs to increase revenue somewhere since fast food customers have begun pushing back on price increases amid overall inflation. \u201cThey\u2019ve underperformed in\u00a0the sandwich\u00a0segment, so they need to shake things up a little bit and drive some incremental traffic,\u201d Henkes said. Technomic data shows that Subway also lags in sales for sides and snacks compared to its competitors. In recent years, Subway has added\u00a0customization to its menu, doubled down on pushing orders to its app, increased its\u00a0international presence\u00a0and introduced\u00a0freshly sliced meats\u00a0\u2014 a major shift from Subway\u2019s previous method of delivering cold cuts pre-sliced. Another major hurdle for Subway is it its dwindling store count: The chain closed more than 400 restaurants in the US in 2023, finishing the year with its smallest number of US restaurants (20,133) since 2005. Owned by Roark Capital, a privately held company, Subway doesn\u2019t regularly release financial figures.

{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_economy_us-retail-sales-may", "text": "Sales at US retailers rose last month at an unexpectedly weak pace as Americans continue to deal with still-high inflation and elevated interest rates. Retail sales rose just 0.1% in May from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. That\u2019s better than April\u2019s downwardly revised 0.2% decline but below the 0.3% gain economists projected in a FactSet poll. The figures are adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation. Sales declined the most at gas stations, down 2.2% in May. Excluding that, sales were up by 0.3% last month. American shoppers also pulled back on purchases at furniture stores (-1.1%) and shops that sell building materials and garden equipment (-0.8%). Meanwhile, spending was the strongest at specialty stores that sell sporting goods, books, and musical instruments, which jumped by 2.8% last month. Monthly retail sales have increased four times over the past six months through May, but figures for April and March were revised lower, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Inflation is down from the 40-year highs of two years ago, but it remains elevated. Meanwhile, interest rates are at their highest in nearly a quarter century after the Federal Reserve launched an aggressive rate-hiking campaign in 2022 to rein in price hikes. Household savings accumulated during the Covid-19 pandemic are dwindling, and may have already been exhausted. A slowing economy help builds a case for the Fed to begin cutting interest rates \u2014 if it\u2019s accompanied by inflation also easing. \u201cSpending is cooling back towards a more sustainable pace,\u201d Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, told CNN\u2019s Matt Egan in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s important we don\u2019t confuse a slower pace of spending with the economy turning over, because that\u2019s clearly not happening.\u201d \u201cTo be honest with you, this is a big relief for policymakers at the Fed,\u201d he added. Shoppers are fatigued Evidence is starting to mount that US consumers are pulling back as they face tough economic hurdles. Retailers such as Walmart, Kohl\u2019s and Target have said that shoppers are feeling pinched and are starting to cut back. While lower-income Americans were already struggling, the pain has now spread to middle-income consumers. \u201cOur customers continue to be pressured by a number of economic factors, including high interest rates and inflation,\u201d Kohl\u2019s CEO Thomas Kingsbury said in an earnings call earlier this month. \u201cOur middle income customer continues to be impacted.\u201d There are signs that even wealthier shoppers are feeling strained. Walmart, America\u2019s largest retailer, said higher-income consumers have been flocking to its stores in search of bargains. High-end retailers have also sounded the alarm of a broad and ongoing slowdown in luxury spending. But at the same time, spending on travel and other in-person experiences such as concerts is expected to be robust this summer. The Commerce Department releases broader consumer spending figures for May, which include services, later this month. Tuesday\u2019s retail sales report only captures spending on goods and food services. What it means for the Fed Weaker-than-expected spending over the past few months helps set the stage for the Fed to begin lowering borrowing costs sometime this year. The figures provide some evidence that the US economy isn\u2019t overheating and is instead slowing. It hasn\u2019t just been spending figures that have come in soft recently. Economic data for April and May showed that inflation began to moderate again after stalling in the first three months of the year. The latest Consumer Price Index, released last week, showed that prices held flat in May on a monthly basis for the first time since July 2022. From a year earlier, consumer prices were up 3.3% in May, slowing from April\u2019s 3.4% rate. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said this week that the latest CPI was \u201cvery welcome\u201d and that the Fed\u2019s latest economic projections reflecting just one rate cut this year make sense. \u201cIn my view, this calls for a cautious approach,\u201d said Harker, who doesn\u2019t vote on policy moves this year, during an event Monday. \u201cIf we start to see several months of where we\u2019re seeing data move in the right direction, I could see taking action. But I\u2019m not there right now.\u201d The timing of the Fed\u2019s first rate cut this cycle will be primarily determined by what\u2019s going on with inflation, but officials say they look at what\u2019s happening economy wide. The first cut will be a consequential decision, because inflation could heat back up if central bank officials cut too soon \u2014 or the economy could slip into a recession if they cut too late.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/economy/us-retail-sales-may/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
