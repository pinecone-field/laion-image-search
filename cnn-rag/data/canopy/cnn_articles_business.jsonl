At issue is the publication of an article that said Palestinians are living under a \u201cbrutally sophisticated structure of oppression\u201d by Israel. The board of directors for the Columbia Law Review said in a statement obtained by CNN that the website has been \u201ctemporarily suspended\u201d because the \u201cpiece had not been subject to the usual processes of review or selection for article.\u201d The website has been offline since Monday, with a message that it\u2019s \u201cunder maintenance\u201d when visited as of Wednesday morning. The New York Times was first to report the outage and the board\u2019s statement. The Columbia Law Review Association is an independent nonprofit organization with its own board of directors, and it is not governed by Columbia University or its law school. The board said it asked the student editors on Sunday to open up the review of the article so \u201call student editors would have an opportunity to read the piece, raise any questions or concerns, and otherwise engage.\u201d \u201cWe thought that was necessary in fairness to student editors who had not been part of the group working on the piece and were not previously aware of the piece\u2019s content or even its existence. Whatever your views of this piece, it will clearly be controversial and potentially have an impact on all associated with the Review,\u201d the statement said. The piece was published Monday, despite the board saying it had asked for a delay in publishing until June 7 pending more review. \u201cWe also would like to get the website back up as soon as possible, as having it down is now preventing access to the Review\u2019s scholarship,\u201d it said. The article that sparked the controversy was written by Rabea Eghbariah, a doctoral candidate at Harvard University. He argues that a new legal concept called Nakba is needed to describe more accurately the current condition of Palestinians. It derives from \u201cal-Nakba,\u201d which Palestinians have used to refer to the 1948 establishment of Israel, and means \u201ccatastrophe\u201d in Arabic. \u201cThe attempt to silence my legal scholarship on the Nakba by shutting down the entire Columbia Law Review website is not only reflective of a pervasive and anti-intellectual Palestine exception to academic freedom but is also a testament to a culture of Nakba denialism,\u201d Eghbariah said in a statement to CNN. Roughly 700,000 Palestinians\u00a0fled or were expelled from their homes\u00a0by armed Jewish groups seeking to establish the state of Israel during Al Nakba. More than 15,000 Palestinians\u00a0were also killed\u00a0and 531 towns and villages destroyed during al-Nakba, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, an institute of the Palestinian Authority. \u201cThe intervention by the CLR Board of Directors exposes, once again, that US academic institutions are, in fact, a very hostile environment for Palestinian voices and thought. What is so scary about Palestinians speaking their truth?\u201d It\u2019s the latest flashpoint for Columbia University that has grappled with demonstrations from pro-Palestinian protesters who put up encampments on the school\u2019s grounds protesting Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. On Tuesday, it settled a lawsuit from a Jewish student that said the school failed provide a safe environment.

{"id": "2024_06_07_business_senators-unitedhealth-patient-data-hack", "text": "A bipartisan pair of senators is accusing a major health care firm that suffered a crippling cyberattack in February of not complying with federal law that requires patients be notified when their data is stolen. In a letter sent to\u00a0UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty this week, New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan and Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn demanded that the health care giant \u201cassume full and immediate responsibility\u201d for giving patients and health providers information on the breach. Federal law known as the\u00a0Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) generally requires health care providers to notify people within 60 days of discovering a breach affecting their personal health data. The Department of Health and Human Services is already investigating whether UnitedHealth is compliant with HIPAA obligations to protect patient data. The department can\u2019t discuss ongoing investigations, an HHS spokesperson told CNN. HHS can use HIPAA to fine companies for failing to protect patient data. The department announced a $4.75 million settlement in February with a nonprofit hospital system in New York for \u201cdata security failures\u201d that the department said resulted in an employee stealing and selling patient data. But the cleanup from the ransomware attack on Change Healthcare, a UnitedHealth subsidiary, has been unusually messy and complicated compared to other ransomware attacks on the health sector. The hack paralyzed computers that Change Healthcare uses to process medical claims across the country. Health care providers were cut off from billions of dollars in payments, according to one hospital association, and some health clinics\u00a0were on the brink of bankruptcy\u00a0because they couldn\u2019t get paid. Witty told Congress last month that a third of Americans may have had their personal data stolen in the hack and that it would likely take \u201cseveral months\u201d before the company is able to identify and notify Americans who were affected. One reason for the lengthy notification process, he said, was that files on patients were compromised in the ransomware attack. In the aftermath of the hack, some health care providers were confused whether they or Change Healthcare were responsible for notifying patients that their data had been breached. On May 31, the HHS Office for Civil Rights clarified that health care providers can delegate that obligation to Change Healthcare. \u201cWe appreciate OCR\u2019s recent clarification that providers and other HIPAA covered entities can delegate their notice obligations to Change, which reiterated our previously stated preference to ease the reporting obligations of our customers,\u201d UnitedHealth spokesperson Eric Hausman\u00a0said in an emailed statement to CNN on Friday. \u201cAs a result, we are working with our customers to ensure the notification process meets their needs and satisfies legal obligations.\u201d The hack cast a spotlight on UnitedHealth\u2019s powerful role in the health care market. The company reported $371 billion in revenue last year. Change Healthcare handles one in three American patient records,\u00a0according\u00a0to the American Hospital Association. Optum, another UnitedHealth subsidiary, employs about 90,000 physicians. The UnitedHealth subsidiary hack, and\u00a0another\u00a0ransomware attack on one of the country\u2019s biggest hospital chains, has also increased pressure on Capitol Hill and in the White House to produce new regulations that require health care companies meet minimum cybersecurity standards. The Hassan-Blackburn letter is not the only inquiry that UnitedHealth faces in the Senate. Sen. Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who chairs the finance committee, has called on the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate UnitedHealth\u2019s cybersecurity practices. The FTC declined to comment, while an SEC spokesperson told CNN that the agency would respond directly to Wyden.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/business/senators-unitedhealth-patient-data-hack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

Southwest (LUV) stock gained more than 6% in trading Monday on the news of Elliott\u2019s letter to the Southwest Board. The airline has been particularly hurt by the fact that it only flies the Boeing 737 jet, and that the promised deliveries of the jets in at least the next year will be delayed by safety and production problems. It has been forced to freeze hiring of pilots as it will take delivery of only 20 of the 79 promised jets. Ellioitt\u2019s letter made no mention of a desire to change Southwest from an all-737 fleet, which would increase the cost of pilot training and spare parts. While Boeing has caused problems for Southwest, some have been self-inflicted. The carrier suffered massive operational problems during the year-end holiday travel period in 2022, causing it to cancel 16,700 flights between December 21 and 29 that year, or nearly half of its schedule. The meltdown was attributed to antiquated staff scheduling software that made it difficult to recover from bad weather at the start of the period. The disruptions cost it more than $1 billion in passenger compensation, increased pay for staff and lost ticketing revenue, in addition to a $140 million fine by the Department of Transportation. Its letter does not give details about the changes it wants to see, other than a change in leadership at the airline. It did say the management company wants to see \u201cincreased customer choice, improved cost execution and updating outdated IT systems, among other opportunities.\u201d Southwest said it was only contacted by Elliott on Sunday. It said it looks \u201cforward to better understanding their views on our company.\u201d \u201cThe Southwest board of directors is confident in our CEO and management\u2019s ability to execute against the company\u2019s strategic plan to drive long-term value for all shareholders, safely and reliably serve our customers and deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders,\u201d it added. Florida-based Elliott, whose web site said it managed about $65.5 billion in assets at the end of last year, was founded in 1977. It recently disclosed a similar $2.5 billion position in Texas Instruments and has reportedly made invests in Softbank and Johnson Controls recently. Southwest is the one airline that does not have seat reservation for its passengers.

They are vigilante taxi drivers taking direct action, having become increasingly frustrated about Hong Kong authorities\u2019 failure to regulate the ride-hailing platform. After the car pulls over, they hand over the driver, often still reeling in shock, to the police officers they have called. \u201cYou may say this is provocative. But without these videos, people may think we inflate the numbers of \u2018white-plate vehicles\u2019 out there,\u201d one of the taxi drivers who took part in a sting operation, and asked to be only identified as Ka Chun, told CNN. \u201cWhite-plate vehicles\u201d is how taxi drivers colloquially refer to Uber. \u201cWe just want the government to enforce the law.\u201d Uber (UBER) remains technically illegal in Hong Kong, which it entered in 2014. But it has thrived under the ambiguous approach of officials keen to project an image of technological modernity. \u201cUber is often framed as innovation, which seems to contribute to the \u2018smart city\u2019 vision \u2013 something that the Hong Kong government has strived to be,\u201d said Oliver Chan, an assistant communications studies professor who specializes in the gig economy at Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Ads for the US-headquartered company are widespread, and its drivers are highly unlikely to face problems with the authorities. Taxi drivers have for years complained about how Uber has flouted local laws, upended the market, and chipped away their already modest earnings. But their recent acts of vigilantism appear to have backfired. Instead of rallying public support, the cabbies were on the receiving end of a backlash, with passengers taking to social media to share their bad experiences of rude taxi drivers, ride rejections and opportunistic charging during heavy rains and the city\u2019s regular summer typhoons. \u201cThey charge arbitrarily and refuse to take passengers. And yet, they have the audacity to go on sting operations,\u201d one person wrote on LIHKG, a popular local internet forum, adding: \u201cShameless people know no bounds.\u201d Others have retaliated by reporting law-breaking taxi drivers to police. Pictures of taxis parking in restricted areas flooded the internet in posts calling for people to report them. WhatsApp groups set up by Uber drivers also discuss how to retaliate, one driver told CNN. So tense is the backlash that Hong Kong leader John Lee, when asked about the furor by reporters last week, acknowledged the \u201cfierce public debate\u201d and appealed for calm. He urged taxi drivers to stay away from any vigilante acts. As with New York\u2019s amber-painted medallion taxis and London\u2019s black hackney cabs, Hong Kong\u2019s 15,000 red urban taxis are emblematic of the city. But they are not exactly known for their friendliness or reliable service. Passenger Lau Chi-tim recalled being charged double during a typhoon a few years ago. Drivers often charge a little more because their insurance does not cover extreme weather conditions. But Lau said: \u201cThe trip lasted only 15 minutes and most of the journey was inside a tunnel anyway. Where is the risk?\u201d Another passenger lamented how selective taxi drivers can be. \u201cPeople with pets, a pram, wanting to cross the harbor, or going anywhere that may be crowded\u2026 they just reject you,\u201d Jason Chan said. Similar complaints abound, despite refusal to take passengers being an offense under the Hong Kong law. Those who prefer Uber see it as an alternative to the poor service they have long tolerated and would rather pay a little more for a smoother ride. An Uber driver, who gave only his name Mo for fear of being identified by authorities, said passengers told him they preferred Uber drivers\u2019 manners, and quality of driving. \u201cWe don\u2019t dare swerve around on the road because it\u2019s our own vehicle,\u201d he said. But for Ka Chun, the driver who went undercover, it\u2019s about defending their interest and an institution that he and his fellow cabbies invested time and money to be part of. \u201cThey have an impact on us because these white-plate vehicles can take passengers without a taxi license,\u201d he said, speaking of a permit that can cost a fortune in the city where properties, and even parking spaces, are traded as speculative commodities. Hong Kong\u2019s transport authority has issued some 18,000 taxi licenses \u2013 including for non-urban blue and green cabs - and they are currently traded for up to $400,000 (HK$3.2 million) in a free market. Annual insurance for a taxi also costs up to 10 times that for private vehicles. Drivers who don\u2019t own a taxi pay rental of 550 Hong Kong dollars (about $70) for a 12-hour shift, almost a third of what they make on an average day, according to Ka Chun. \u201cUber drivers don\u2019t need any capital whatsoever as they are using their own car to take passengers,\u201d he said. Patrick Tam, secretary general of the Hong Kong Taxi & Public Light Bus Association, acknowledged the complaints against some unruly taxi drivers, and said he supported the police going after them. \u201cThese taxi drivers should face tough punishment. But it doesn\u2019t make vehicles operating without a proper license less of a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just want fair treatment.\u201d So far, Hong Kong police have said they had not arrested any Uber drivers ensnared in the amateur sting operations. Estyn Chung, general manager of Uber in Hong Kong, noted that the company launched its Uber Taxi service in 2020 to give riders the option to get a taxi on its app. \u201cWe know from elsewhere around the world that taxi and ride-sharing services can thrive alongside each other. Hong Kong is not an exception,\u201d he said. Creating harmony between traditional cabbies and gig-economy drivers can be tricky. And CUHK\u2019s Chan said that, after years of ambiguity, Hong Kong is already playing catch-up. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say the extent to which the government wants to promote Uber, and more broadly, ride-hailing platforms at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Hong Kong\u2019s ride-hailing regulations lag behind, for example, Singapore.\u201d The city government is expected to unveil a study on online ride-hailing services in July. A spokesman said it is \u201copen-minded\u201d on the apps, though \u201cthey must be in compliance with the relevant law and regulations.\u201d \u201cThe government should require them to get a different driver permit and insurance even if it legalizes their operation,\u201d said Ka Chun. \u201cOtherwise, why should I get a taxi license? I could drive white-plate vehicles.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/tech/hong-kong-uber-taxis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

The company said the issue stems from a defective anti-lock braking system, which in turn deactivates the stability control system. The system is a critical safety feature in many vehicles which prevents a loss of steering capabilities in emergency situations when the driver loses control of the vehicle, like on icy or flooded roads. Using a vehicle with a disabled stability system could increase the likelihood of a crash, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Thursday. Multiple studies have found electronic stability control systems tend to reduce fatal collisions, particularly single-vehicle and rollover crashes. Since 2012, the NHTSA has mandated that all new passenger cars include an ESC system. The models being recalled are the 2022 Dodge Durango, and 2022 Ram 2500 and 3500. The Ram 2500 is the most affected, with nearly 158,000 pickups recalled. A little over 53,000 Durangos and 524 Ram 3500s are involved in the recall. Stellantis said it will begin notifying affected vehicle owners in late July. The company said customers will be able to bring their cars in to the dealers to update their vehicle\u2019s anti-lock braking systems for free.

{"id": "2024_06_05_business_walmart-hourly-worker-bonuses", "text": "Walmart, America\u2019s largest private-sector employer, is starting a bonus program for its hourly employees. The company said on Wednesday that the program will be aimed at rewarding employees who stay with the company long-term, with employees able to earn up to a maximum of $1,000 for those who have been with the company 20 years or more. The company said any hourly store employee who has been with the company for a year or more is eligible for the bonus program, with those full-time employees with at least a year but less than five years getting an annual bonus of $350. The amount of the bonus then increases from there with seniority. Walmart has an outsized impact on the labor market for hourly workers, and has been grappling with finding and retaining the workers it needs in a tight labor market. It said it has raised hourly wages by around 30% over the last five years and that its average US hourly wage now is close to $18. Its starting pay ranges from $14 to $19 depending on the store and local market. A $1,000 bonus comes to just under 50 cents an hour for employees working a 40-hour week and equal to about 3% of annual pay for those full-time workers making that average hourly pay. The company has 1.6 million US employees, of which nearly 1.5 million are hourly workers. It said this new program covers about 700,000 of those hourly employees who work in stores. Store managers and supervisors already qualified for a bonus program, which is paid out in March after the close of the company\u2019s fiscal year at the end of January. Walmart boosted the average pay of its store managers from $117,000 to $128,000, or by just over 9%, the retailer announced earlier this year. \u2013 CNN\u2019s Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/business/walmart-hourly-worker-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers.

The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing.

{"id": "2024_06_08_business_red-lobster-black-history", "text": "Communities around the country are losing cheddar bay biscuits and all-you-can-eat seafood deals as troubled Red Lobster closes around 100 US restaurants, with up to 135 more closures looming. But Red Lobster\u2019s decline is particularly a loss for many Black diners, who formed a loyal base for the brand and still account for a higher share of customers than other major casual chain restaurants, according to historians, customers and former Red Lobster executives. \u201cRed Lobster cultivated Black customers. It has not shied away from that customer base like some brands have,\u201d Clarence Otis Jr., the former CEO of Darden Restaurants from 2004 to 2014, when the company still owned the chain, told CNN. After Otis became CEO, Sacramento Observer columnist Mardeio Cannon wrote that \u201cit is only fitting\u201d Red Lobster had a Black CEO because \u201cif there is any restaurant in America that most African Americans love, it\u2019s Red Lobster.\u201d In a 2015 presentation to investors, Red Lobster said 16% of customers were Black, two percentage points higher than the Black share of the US population. Red Lobster did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on current customer demographics. The chain hired Black workers and served Black guests from its beginnings in the South in the late 1960s, and Black celebrities such as Chris Rock and Nicki Minaj worked there before they became famous. (Minaj later joked about being fired from \u201call three or four\u201d of the Red Lobsters where she worked over \u201cLobsterita\u201d drinks and cheddar bay biscuits with Jimmy Fallon.) And Beyonc\u00e9 sang about taking a romantic partner to Red Lobster in her 2016 song \u201cFormation,\u201d which addresses police brutality, Hurricane Katrina and Black culture in America.  Red Lobster attracted both working-class and affluent Black diners during the 1970s and 1980s at a time when many sit-down restaurants were unwelcoming of Black patrons, said Marcia Chatelain, a professor of Africana studies at the University of Pennsylvania and author of \u201cFranchise: The Golden Arches in Black America,\u201d which explores the relationship between McDonald\u2019s and Black consumers. Red Lobster\u2019s early locations near shopping malls also helped it grow with Black customers, she said.  \u201cThe placement of Red Lobster outlets near shopping malls coincided with the opening of more retail options for African Americans after the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cThis style of restaurant was appealing to people seeking a fine dining-like experience without dealing with the uncertainty of how they would be treated at local businesses.\u201d Civil rights mythology Founded by Bill Darden, Red Lobster was racially integrated when it opened in 1968 in Lakeland, Florida. Hiring and serving Black people was not a revolutionary step by Darden, and he certainly was far from the first to leap at the opportunity. But it was another marker of racial progress for Black people in Lakeland and the changing South. In Lakeland during the early 1960s, local civil rights activists picketed businesses and movie theaters that denied entry to Black patrons, forcing them to integrate. Although Red Lobster\u2019s opening came four years after passage of the Civil Rights Act mandating desegregation of public accommodations, many schools and businesses still were segregated. Some closed rather than integrate. Red Lobster was \u201calways very open and receptive to us,\u201d said Beverly Boatwright, who was active in the sit-in movement in Lakeland while attending the all-Black high school, along with her mother, a leader in the local branch of the NAACP. \u201cWe never had a problem at Red Lobster. There were other places where we did have struggles\u201d in the city. But Red Lobster was not immediately a popular spot with Black customers in Lakeland, and the mythology of Darden as a civil rights pioneer that has grown in recent years has been overstated. Red Lobster was not a \u201cplace we frequented a whole lot\u201d in its early days, said Harold Dwight, who graduated two years after Boatwright in 1968. Most Black residents did not have the means to go out to eat, Dwight said. When they did, they went to establishments run by Black owners and Morrison\u2019s Cafeteria, the largest cafeteria chain in the South, which had been integrated for several years and had more Black employees. In corporate lore, Darden\u2019s first restaurant, the Green Frog \u2014which opened in 1938 in Waycross, Georgia \u2014 was desegregated. Darden has been lauded in various articles as a \u201csocial crusader\u201d \u201cwho [stood] up to Jim Crow\u201d in \u201cdefiance\u201d of segregation laws. On Darden Restaurants\u2019 corporate website, the company mentions the Green Frog and says its founder \u201cwelcomed all guests to his tables.\u201d But the Green Frog did not welcome Black diners initially, according to Black people who grew up in Waycross and recall the Green Frog, which closed in the 1980s. John Fluker, a former mayor of Waycross, said Black people worked in the kitchen, but the Green Frog did not welcome Black customers. The Green Frog reflected the racial norms of the time in south Georgia, said Waycross resident Horace Thomas. \u201cThey didn\u2019t open the doors for Black people,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody was like that.\u201d Cultural appeal Although Black customers did not immediately frequent Red Lobster, the chain gradually built strength with Black patrons as it expanded in the South and across the country. Red Lobster developed a reputation for being friendly and open to Black customers, in part because it had Black staff when a new restaurant opened, and it later developed marketing strategies to court Black diners, say historians and former executives. Walter King, who was hired in 1971 to manage a Red Lobster restaurant, was one of the company\u2019s earliest Black employees and stayed with the chain for 36 years. Red Lobster later named one of its signature dishes after King: \u201cWalt\u2019s Favorite Shrimp.\u201d King died last year. \u201cThey\u2019ve been loyal to us and we\u2019ve been loyal to them,\u201d Beverly Boatwright said. \u201cWe went there because the food was delicious. It was the only place you could get good seafood. It was a luxury.\u201d Red Lobster\u2019s cuisine was also a major part of its popularity with Black diners. Outdoor fish fries with catfish, crawfish and other seafood have served as a popular tradition in Black communities, said Robyn Autry, a sociology professor at Wesleyan University who studies race and wrote recently on how Red Lobster\u2019s downfall \u201chits differently\u201d for Black communities. Red Lobster brought the \u201coutdoor fried fish experience\u201d indoors, Autry said. For many Black people, it became a \u201cmarker of status to move from outdoor fish fries to sitting down with menus and being served.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/business/red-lobster-black-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

The league also said Monday it had its most-watched start of the season games ever across all six networks that broadcast matches \u2014 ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, CBS, ION and NBA TV. Women\u2019s basketball is experiencing a boom thanks to the phenomenon around WNBA rookie Clark.  The NCAA women\u2019s basketball National Championship matchup between Clark\u2019s alma mater the Iowa Hawkeyes and the South Carolina Gamecocks earlier this year drew 18.9 million viewers, smashing television ratings records. Since then, her entry to the WNBA, along with other players like Reese, has kicked off a new era in the league. Clark\u2019s professional debut in May drew the largest WNBA audience in two decades. People of color and young people are turning to the WNBA with interest. Viewership grew 60% year-over-year among people of color, the WNBA said, with huge jumps in Hispanic and Black audiences, who represent most of the group.

{"id": "2024_06_10_tech_tesla-self-driving-cars-china-hnk-intl", "text": "Tesla is one step closer to launching full-self driving (FSD) technology in China after it clinched an agreement with Baidu to upgrade its mapping software. The Chinese tech giant said Saturday that it was providing lane-level navigation services for Tesla cars. Baidu (BIDU) says this level of navigation can provide drivers with detailed information, including making lane recommendations ahead of upcoming turns, to enhance safety. Experts said during Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk\u2019s surprise visit to China at the end of April that one of his main hurdles in securing government approval to rollout the company\u2019s FSD software was reaching a mapping and navigation deal with Baidu. \u201cWith the support of Baidu\u2019s lane-level map, Tesla\u2019s navigation can accurately render lane changes on the road the user is currently on, upgrading from providing road-level guidance to providing lane-level guidance,\u201d Baidu said in the statement. China\u2019s answer to Google has been been providing mapping services to Tesla since 2020. But prior to Saturday\u2019s announcement, its services had been limited to \u201croad-level\u201d information, which is less precise than lane-level navigation. A day earlier, Tesla launched its new software upgrade for users in urban areas in China, the world\u2019s biggest car market, saying in a statement on WeChat that such detailed road information was being made available \u201cfor the first time.\u201d CNN has reached out to Tesla for comment. On Monday, Baidu declined further comment. Virtually all Teslas have a driver-assistance system called Autopilot, while the more robust FSD feature comes at a premium price. Autopilot is available in China, but not the full FSD feature. Teaming up with Baidu would remove an obstacle, as the Chinese firm has key mapping credentials that can be applied to driver-assistance functions. According to Chinese regulations, all self-driving systems must obtain mapping qualifications before operating on public roads. Foreign car companies need to partner with licensed Chinese companies to qualify for surveying and mapping. Partnering with Baidu would allow Tesla to run its full self-driving system on China\u2019s public roads, with its vehicles able to collect surrounding data, such as road layout, traffic signs and buildings. It could also accelerate Tesla\u2019s global development of its self-driving technology, as data from China could be used to train Tesla\u2019s algorithms needed for fully autonomous vehicles. Car owners have long complained on social media about Tesla\u2019s previous navigation services, which were also provided by Baidu, saying they often have to rely on other maps available on smartphones while driving. \u201cThis time, you can really remove your mobile phone holders (mounted in the car),\u201d Tesla said in its Friday announcement, suggesting drivers no longer need other maps for navigation. The news went viral on Chinese social media on Monday. \u201cAfter the system upgrade, I no longer need to use my mobile phone to navigate,\u201d said one Weibo user. \u201cTesla\u2019s (own) navigation system can finally be used.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u201d Introducing the FSD system could provide a revenue boost to Tesla, which is having a tough time in China. In April, it slashed prices across its car product lines in the country, hoping to bolster sales in the face of slowing demand and increased competition.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/tech/tesla-self-driving-cars-china-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_investing_premarket-stocks-trading-fed-meeting-rates", "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business\u2019 Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Another month, another hot jobs report that has Wall Street wondering when the Federal Reserve will finally cut interest rates. The US economy added 272,000 jobs in May, racing past economists\u2019 predictions for 180,000. The jobless rate rose only slightly to 4%\ufeff. The hot jobs report is a double-edged sword for Wall Street. On one hand, a resilient labor market lessens the chance that the economy will tip into recession. On the other, it puts long-awaited interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve on the back burner. Traders are betting that the Fed will ease rates once or twice this year, but not before September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The Fed is expected to hold rates steady at its policy meeting this week, as inflation remains above its 2% target and the economy is slow to cool. Investors are awaiting the latest Summary of Economic Projections, which contains the \u201cdot plot,\u201d or a chart where Fed officials project where rates could head in the future. Before the Bell spoke with Nate Thooft, chief investment officer of multi-asset solutions at Manulife Investment Management, about when he expects the Federal Reserve to begin cutting rates and what that means for markets. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Before the Bell: Do you think the Fed could lower its projection for three quarter-point rate cuts this year? There\u2019s no doubt that they could. The Fed\u2019s dot plot is still basically saying three, so there\u2019s a reasonable chance the dot plot does adjust to two as the possible outcome. But we\u2019re in the camp that it\u2019s two or three quarter-point [cuts]. I\u2019m not sure it really matters that much in the grand scheme of things, because the big point will be we are going to begin a cutting cycle the way other major global central banks are, whether it\u2019s the [European Central Bank] or Bank of Canada. The US will very likely join them, at least starting the cutting cycle before the end of this year with one to three cuts \u2014 our argument is two or three \u2014 and then they\u2019ll continue to do so through the course of 2025. Is it concerning that the European Central Bank and Bank of Canada have begun cutting rates before the Fed? The big thing that we have a lot of anxiety about is currency. (BTB: Higher interest rates tend to strengthen a currency.) The other central banks can move several quarter-points before the Fed, but they can\u2019t go into a completely accommodative state while the Fed is still in a very restrictive state. While the Fed and other central banks generally don\u2019t have currency as part of their explicit mandate, they are not void of being aware of those dynamics. So, I do think generally speaking, we believe the dollar is probably close to or right around its kind of peak levels. But there is a risk that if the Fed has to delay longer and other central banks continue to move forward, it\u2019s going to become more problematic for risk assets in general, especially outside the US if the dollar strength continues, like we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years. So that\u2019s something that we are watching very closely. Do you think questions about whether the Fed will cut rates later this year could add to stock market volatility as we draw closer to election day? You could see some additional volatility in the US around the election. But ultimately, and our view has always been this case, the US electorate is very split and very equally split. And so you\u2019re not going to be likely in a position where either party has significant majorities across the three components of government \u2026 which means significant policy changes are not that likely over the coming four years. And overall, that\u2019s been a positive for the US for much of its history when it comes to elections not really directly impacting markets much other than some short-term volatility around the election cycle. Workers at Samsung Electronics walk out for the first time ever A labor union at Samsung Electronics in South Korea said many workers went on strike Friday, marking the first such walkout in the smartphone and chipmaking giant\u2019s 55-year history, report my colleagues Yoonjung Seo and Diksha Madhok. The Nationwide Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU) said last week that its 28,000 members \u2014 just under a quarter of the company\u2019s total workforce in the country \u2014 would stage a one-day strike on June 7, following failed negotiations over pay and bonus arrangements. The union asked its members to take a day off on Friday, which falls between a public holiday on Thursday and the weekend. Son Woomok, a union leader, told CNN that \u201cmany employees used their annual leave today,\u201d and at one site \u201call workers had taken leave so replacement personnel were deployed.\u201d He did not provide other details. He had previously said many NSEU members work for Samsung\u2019s flagship semiconductor unit. That division is trying to regain its former status as a top semiconductor company, according to Reuters, which says Samsung has fallen behind its competitors SK Hynix and Micron Technology in delivering chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) processors. A Samsung spokesperson told CNN that, \u201cthere is no impact on production and management activities\u201d as a result of the one-day walkout. Read more here. How a Depression-era law could be used to make your booze cheaper Federal regulators are planning to use a rarely enforced law from the Great Depression to allege America\u2019s largest alcohol distributor is unfairly pricing wine and spirits, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. A looming Federal Trade Commission lawsuit against Southern Glazer\u2019s Wine and Spirits would be aimed at lowering costs for consumers \u2014 in this case on alcohol \u2014 and ensuring mom-and-pop shops have a level playing field against big chains, the source said. The case, which could be risky, would represent the latest effort by Biden administration regulators to show they are taking action to lower costs and confront dominant companies, reports my colleague Matt Egan.  It would also be the latest aggressive step by FTC Chair Lina Khan, who recently led the agency to ban most employers from using noncompete clauses and is probing a Microsoft deal with an artificial intelligence startup. The latest battleground in the antitrust fight could be booze. Southern Glazer\u2019s, based in Miami and operating in 44 US states, is the largest wine and spirits distributor in the United States. The family-owned company distributes everything from Grey Goose vodka and Jim Beam bourbon to Yellow Tail wine. The FTC lawsuit, previously reported by Politico, could come in the next few weeks and would rely on the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, the source said. That Depression-era law prohibits suppliers from providing deeper discounts to large chains than to smaller stores.

{"id": "2024_06_10_investing_french-election-stocks-euro-reaction", "text": "French markets and the euro were roiled Monday by President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s surprise decision to call a snap election after his party lost to the far right in a vote for European lawmakers. Big gains for the far right in the French election could force Macron to govern with a hostile parliament, making it harder for his centrist administration to pursue its policy agenda and raising doubts about its ability to put government finances on a more sustainable footing. France\u2019s CAC 40 index, which represents 40 of the biggest companies listed in Paris, fell 1.8% by 11.02 a.m. ET, with banks among the biggest losers. Europe\u2019s benchmark Stoxx 600 index was trading 0.5% down on the day by the same time. The euro fell 0.6% against the US dollar in late-afternoon trade, sinking to its lowest level in a month. Against the British pound, the currency, shared by 20 countries in Europe, also dropped 0.6% to stand at its weakest level in nearly two years. Macron dissolved the French parliament and called the election after an exit poll Sunday showed that his Renaissance party was set to be trounced by the National Rally, a far-right opposition party, in the European elections. The first round of the French election is scheduled for June 30, followed by a second round on July 7. Under the French system, parliamentary elections are held to elect the 577 members of the lower house, the National Assembly. A separate election is held to choose the country\u2019s president, and this is not scheduled until 2027. Banks slump That sets up the possibility of significant changes in the composition of the National Assembly, which could make it harder for Macron to govern. \u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot of moving parts, and it\u2019s not clear what a (new) government would look like,\u201d said Mike O\u2019Sullivan, chief economist at Moonfare, a private equity investment firm. \u201cEven if the (far right) don\u2019t do very well, (Macron) would still have a varied coalition of the center (parties) to put together, and it\u2019s not clear what key policies would unite those parties in a government.\u201d The uncertainty is rattling markets, he told CNN. In his view, Macron and his government have been good for parts of the French economy. \u201cFor example, unemployment is at a historic low, parts of the economy \u2014\u00a0particularly the tech investment part \u2014 have been thriving\u2026 A lot of that becomes very uncertain.\u201d Shares in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale had tumbled 8% by late afternoon in Paris, while shares in BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole were down 5.5% and 4.4% respectively. Commenting on the losses suffered by French banking stocks, Johann Scholtz, an equity analyst at Morningstar, said investors were concerned about the National Rally\u2019s \u201cinterventionist economic policies.\u201d \u201cIn many European jurisdictions, banks have become a soft target for populist measures such as windfall taxes and restrictions on dividends (and) share buybacks,\u201d he wrote in a note. Bond market jitters Of particular concern, according to analysts, is how a potentially very different parliament would affect France\u2019s ability to whittle down its huge government debt burden, which stood at 110.6% of gross domestic product at the end of last year. The budget deficit \u2014 the difference between what the government spends and what it receives in taxes \u2014 reached 5.5% of the country\u2019s GDP last year. In May, ratings agency S&P downgraded France\u2019s long-term credit score, citing the \u201cdeterioration of (its) budgetary position,\u201d though it still thinks the country has ample capacity to repay its debts. The agency said it expected the budget deficit to narrow to 3.5% of GDP in 2027, which is well above the 2.9% targeted by the government for that year. Andrew\u00a0Kenningham, chief Europe economist at consultancy Capital Economics, wrote in a note Monday: \u201cThe immediate concern for the economy is that (a new parliament) could make it even more difficult for the government to bring down the fiscal deficit.\u201d Bond traders are taking notice. The yield, or interest rate, on France\u2019s benchmark government bonds ticked up Monday to reach its highest level since late November. Higher yields indicate that investors want a bigger premium to buy French bonds given the political uncertainty. The gap between yields on 10-year German and French government bonds also widened. In general, a larger gap or \u201cspread\u201d between the yields on a European country\u2019s bonds and their ultra-safe German equivalents signals a higher risk for investors in holding the former bonds. \u201cA right-wing majority in the (French parliament) would hamper any reform plans. The deficit picture in France is already weak and this would further add to market concerns,\u201d Mohit Kumar, chief Europe economist at Jefferies, an investment bank, wrote in a note.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/investing/french-election-stocks-euro-reaction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_business_tj-maxx-body-cameras-shoplifting", "text": "Hourly retail security workers are now wearing police-like body cameras at major stores. Retail giant TJX, the parent of TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, said it\u2019s equipping some store employees with body cameras to thwart shoplifting and keep customers and employees safe. TJX finance chief John Klinger disclosed the body-camera initiative on an earnings call last month. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a de-escalation, where people are less likely to do something when they\u2019re being videotaped,\u201d he said. TJX isn\u2019t alone. In a survey of major chains by the National Retail Federation last year, 35% of US retailers said they were researching body cameras for employees. The manufacturer of Taser devices and other security companies are now designing and marketing body cameras specifically for retail workers. Although retailers say they\u2019re looking to cut down on costly merchandise loss and keep stores safe, outfitting workers with body cameras may do little to stop shoplifting, some criminologists say. Worker advocates say improved training, better staffing levels in stores and other safety investments will go further to protect frontline workers and reduce shoplifting. One TJ Maxx retail worker in Florida said the body cameras were \u201cjust for show\u201d and their presence did not make employees feel any safer. The job of these security workers \u201cwas to just stand there with the tactical vest labeled \u2018security,\u2019 and the camera mounted on the vest,\u201d said the employee, who spoke under the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters.  \u201cIt feels like the implementation of this program with the cameras isn\u2019t meant to achieve anything, but rather just something the company can point to\u201d to say it is improving security. Loss prevention workers Over the past year, TJX has assigned its hourly unarmed security workers, known as loss prevention associates, to wear body cameras in certain stores. The TJX workers who wear the cameras undergo \u201cthorough training on how to use the cameras effectively in their roles,\u201d a TJX spokesperson said. The company only shares video footage upon law enforcement request or in response to a subpoena. \u201cBody cameras are just one of the many ways that we work to support a safe store environment,\u201d the spokesperson said. The company did not provide additional details on training or share policy on when the cameras are turned on. TJX is one of the only retailers speaking publicly about body cameras and posting job openings with specific details of the cameras in the job description. The primary responsibilities of one job at a Marshalls in Miami Beach, Florida, are to maintain a \u201cproper and professional stance\u201d at the front of the store, act as a \u201cvisual deterrent to prevent potential loss/dishonesty\u201d and wear a company-issued body camera. The description says that the camera is to record \u201cspecific events involving critical incidents for legal, safety, and training purposes.\u201d These employees, who wear a company-approved black vest, black pants and black shoes, are instructed not to stop or chase after shoplifting suspects. Growing trend The retail industry is responding to theft in stores and violence against workers. Many retailers report they have seen an uptick in organized theft, which typically involves groups of thieves who steal items at stores. About 90% of asset protection specialists surveyed last year by the National Retail Federation said the crime had become more of a risk over the prior three years and that shoplifters have become more violent. Precise national data on organized retail crime is lacking, however, and some analysts say the threat of shoplifting to retailers is overblown. Body cameras are just the latest in a slew of security measures retailers have taken, such as locking up products behind glass cases and removing self-checkout stations. Retailers are also working more closely with law enforcement and devoting more internal resources to investigating theft. In the UK, Tesco, Lidl and other grocers have issued body cameras to employees. Bakery chain Greggs gave employees body cameras after a rise in sausage roll thefts and threats from customers. Axon Enterprise, which owns Taser and primarily develops technology and products for police, launched a \u201cBody Workforce\u201d camera this year for retail and health care workers. These cameras are lighter than ones Axon develops for police offers because they don\u2019t record for as long and require as much a battery life, Axon President Joshua Isner said at an analyst conference last month. They are also a more \u201cinviting product, instead of more of like a militaristic\u201d camera worn by police, he said. \u201cWe think retail is an emerging market for body cameras,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think this is a logical extension of where our business is headed.\u201d The company told CNN that dozens of retailers are piloting Axon\u2019s body cameras, including big-box chains and specialty retailers. Axon did not share specific chains. One trial retailer saw a 53% reduction in incidents with the cameras compared to stores where employees were not wearing them, the company said. Series of concerns Over the past decade, police departments have equipped officers with body cameras to improve public accountability. John Eck, a criminologist at the University of Cincinnati, said body cameras in retail \u201ccan help sort things out\u201d when there are customer complaints over issues like racial profiling in stores or wrongful arrests for shoplifting. Despite TJX and Axon\u2019s claims, some criminologists say that body cameras are unlikely to be an added deterrent to shoplifters who already know that there are cameras throughout stores. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much this will stop someone in the act. They\u2019re already going in with the assumption they will be recorded,\u201d said Ernesto Lopez, a research specialist who has studied shoplifting trends at the Council on Criminal Justice. Body cameras could help retailers or law enforcement identify shoplifters, but that would require employees wearing them to get close to a suspect, potentially putting their safety at risk. \u201cI would be really cautious about putting underpaid, undertrained people in these positions,\u201d said Thaddeus Johnson, a senior research fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice. \u201cWe have to be really careful when we talk about body-worn cameras.\u201d Stuart Appelbaum, the president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, said, \u201cit\u2019s not enough to just slap a camera on somebody and say it\u2019s an alternative to doing more significant safety measures.\u201d The union, which does not represent TJX stores, has advocated for legislation advancing in New York that will require retail employers to adopt a violence prevention plan and train workers in de-escalation and active shooters. Large employers must install panic buttons throughout stores under the legislation. Appelbaum also expressed concerns about the information the body cameras are collecting and whether it could be used to stymie union organizing attempts. \u201cEmployees feel like they are under surveillance,\u201d he said. -CNN\u2019s Curt Devine contributed to this article.

{"id": "2024_06_05_investing_dollar-tree-family-dollar-sale", "text": "Dollar Tree said Wednesday it will explore a sale or spinoff of Family Dollar, less than a decade after acquiring the chain in what has turned out to be a disastrous merger. Family Dollar has around 8,000 US stores, catering to low-income customers predominantly in cities with prices typically ranging from $1 to $10. The chain has struggled in recent years. Last year, Family Dollar announced plans to close more than 900 stores. Dollar Tree CEO Rick Dreiling said in a statement that the \u201cunique needs\u201d of the two different chains led the company to explore a split from Family Dollar. Dollar Tree typically has stores in suburban areas and focuses on middle-income consumers, unlike Family Dollar, which is located in more urban areas and caters to lower-income customers. Messy stores, high prices and over-expansion have plagued Family Dollar, analysts say. The chain has also faced steep competition from larger retailers, such as Walmart and Dollar General. And inflation in recent years has increased Family Dollar\u2019s operating costs and squeezed its lower-income customers. \u201cThe saga of Family Dollar is a long and unhappy one,\u201d Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients Wednesday. \u201cThe harsh reality is that Family Dollar is a problematic business which is a millstone around Dollar Tree\u2019s neck, dragging down overall performance.\u201d Family Dollar\u2019s sales at stores open at least one year ticked up 0.1% last quarter. Dollar Tree\u2019s (DLTR) stock fell 3% in premarket trading. Merger gone bad Family Dollar has struggled since Dollar Tree bought it in 2015\u00a0for $8.5 billion. Dollar Tree believed acquiring Family Dollar would help it compete against bigger rivals. But it misjudged the deal. The combined company hoped that by joining forces it could grow its customer base, reduce costs and fend off Dollar General, which is located primarily in rural areas. Dollar General had also bid for Family Dollar. But analysts say the match between the two different chains was a poor fit, and Dollar Tree has struggled to manage the larger Family Dollar store base. Family Dollar stores were in worse condition than Dollar Tree management expected, and early strategies to improve sales, such as selling beer, fell short. Many Family Dollar stores were located too close to each other and cannibalized each other\u2019s own sales. \u201cFamily Dollar\u2019s sales have been sputtering, hurt by neglected stores, poor product selection and unhappy workers,\u201d The Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0in 2018. Family Dollar \u201cneeds more work than the company originally thought.\u201d A year later, an activist investor pushed for a sale of the \u201cunderperforming\u201d Family Dollar business, and Family Dollar announced it would\u00a0close hundreds of stores. Even though Family Dollar has renovated thousands of stores in recent years, many are still poorly maintained, analysts say. Family Dollar was hit with a record $41.6 million fine by the Justice Department this year for violating product safety standards after selling items that were stocked in a rat-infested warehouse in West Memphis filled with live, dead and decaying rodents.

{"id": "2024_06_09_business_elon-musk-pay-package-shareholder-vote", "text": "Tesla\u2019s controversial CEO Elon Musk, and his massive wealth, are front and center in a shareholder vote this coming week. Five months ago, a Delaware judge threw out the largest pay package in history, then worth more than $50 billion, that Telsa\u2019s very friendly board had given Musk in 2018. Now, Musk and the board want Tesla shareholders not only to vote again to give him back those stock options, but to relocate Tesla away from the judge\u2019s state entirely. And his board is threatening if they don\u2019t do so, they won\u2019t get the attention they need from Musk to turn around a company facing its greatest trouble in several years. Tesla\u2019s stock price slid by more than half from its peak as a trillion-dollar company in late 2021. Its sales fell short of forecasts and promises. Its profits are squeezed by a global price war for EVs that it started itself. The answer will come Thursday, when Tesla holds its annual shareholders meeting and announces results of shareholder votes on two proposals. One would once again approve the package of 303 million split-adjusted stock options, worth $46.9 billion as of Friday\u2019s closing price. That\u2019s down from the $51 billion those options were worth at the time of the decision. The shareholders approved the package back in 2018, with 73% voting in favor of it. But Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick in January ruled in favor of shareholders who challenged the package. She wrote that the company\u2019s board \u201cbore the burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair, and they failed to meet their burden.\u201d McCormick said that process the Tesla board used to create the pay package was \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and criticized the board for being to close to the famous CEO to represent the interests of the shareholders. \u201cMusk launched a self-driving process, recalibrating the speed and direction along the way as he saw fit,\u201d she wrote. Musk and Tesla reacted by appealing the ruling, and by seeking permission from shareholders to move the company\u2019s state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas, where its headquarters is located. Many major companies are incorporated in a different state from where their main offices are located, often in Delaware, which has a reputation for being business friendly. It was because of Tesla\u2019s incorporation in Delaware that McCormick was able to rule on the fairness of the pay package. Despite the widespread support among shareholders back in 2018 for Musk\u2019s pay package, the Tesla board seems to be scrambling to shore-up support for this month\u2019s vote. It has filed with the SEC more than two dozen communications with shareholders advocating for a yes vote, far more active than most companies are when seeking shareholder approval of their proxy items. It has even opened a lottery in which the winning shareholder who casts a vote gets a tour of Tesla\u2019s Texas factory conducted personally by Musk. Holding Musk\u2019s focus Tesla\u2019s filings to shareholders argue it must keep the pay package in place to keep Musk fully engaged running Tesla and not one of his other companies. \u201cThis is obviously not about the money,\u201d Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm wrote in a letter to shareholders. \u201cWe all know Elon is one of the wealthiest people on the planet, and he would remain so even if Tesla were to renege on the commitment we made in 2018. Elon is not a typical executive, and Tesla is not a typical company.\u201d Rather, she continued, it\u2019s about \u201cwhat will motivate him to continue to create value for stockholders,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhat we recognized in 2018 and continue to recognize today is that one thing Elon most certainly does not have is unlimited time,\u201d Denholm wrote. \u201cNor does he face any shortage of ideas and other places he can make an incredible difference in the world. We want those ideas, that energy and that time to be at Tesla, for the benefit of you, our owners. But that requires reciprocal respect.\u201d But part of the problem with winning support is that Musk is far more controversial than he was in 2018, and appears to be far less focused on simply running Tesla. He famously bought social media platform Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, selling $22.9 billion of his Tesla shares to help fund that purchase. He has even been accused of improperly selling $7.5 billon of those shares late that year knowing that Tesla was due to soon report disappointing sales that would reduce Tesla\u2019s price. Under his management of Twitter, since rebranded X, he\u2019s restored accounts for users who had been banned for hate speech, advocacy of violence or misinformation. Meanwhile, allegations about widespread antisemitism on the platform, and Musk\u2019s own endorsement of antisemitic tweets, has driven away many advertisers and caused widespread losses. But perhaps a more serious concern among Tesla shareholders is problems faced by the electric car pioneer itself. While shares shot up more than 1,700% between when the original package was approved in 2018 and its high point in November 2021, making Musk the richest person in the world at that time, it has lost more than half of that value since, including a 30% drop this year. Tesla has been forced to cut prices in the face of weaker than forecast demand for sales, and increased competition from other automakers offering their own EVs. \u201cThis shareholder vote is happening at the most tenuous time for Musk,\u201d said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities and an analyst who is still bullish on Tesla shares. \u201cAfter Tesla went through a Cinderella ride, it\u2019s become a horror show. There\u2019s a group of shareholders who are frustrated. And this is a shot across the bow for them to show they\u2019re not satisfied.\u201d While Ives thinks that the pay package will again be approved by shareholders in the current vote, he said it will be a much closer vote this time. He said despite Tesla\u2019s problems and the controversy swirling around Musk, many shareholders believe keeping him at the company, and focused on Tesla more than SpaceX, his new artificial intelligence company xAI, The Boring Company, Neuralink and his rebranded social media company X, or his other ventures, is crucial for the company\u2019s future. Musk has even said he would not want to grow Tesla to become a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics, as he has promised, without a compensation plan that would give him ownership of around 25% of the company\u2019s stock. That would be about double the roughly 13% stake he currently owns. \u201cIt comes down to Musk,\u201d Ives said. \u201cMusk is still the hearts and lungs of the Tesla growth story.\u201d Supporters, opponents to Musk options Some high profile shareholders have spoken out in favor of Musk ahead of the vote, including Ron Baron, CEO of Baron Capital, which has Tesla as one of its top holdings with  a stake worth more than $2 billion in the company. \u201cElon\u2019s compensation contract contained aggressive performance metrics that few in 2018 believed could be achieved. If these aggressive performance metrics had not been achieved, Elon would have received\u00a0nothing,\u201d Baron said in a recent statement. \u201cWhen Tesla achieved targeted earnings, revenues, and market cap metrics, Tesla\u2019s shareholders benefitted greatly. He performed under his compensation contract. He earned his pay. Elon is the ultimate \u2018key man.\u2019\u00a0Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla.\u201d But there are also high profile opponents of the deal including Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, two firms that advise investors on how to vote on proxy proposals. Both are urging no votes on Musk\u2019s package. \u201cThe award value was considered outsized from the start,\u201d wrote ISS. \u201cSome investors may find the board\u2019s argument compelling, that it would be unfair for CEO Musk not to receive the award. However, the concerns raised, both back in 2018 and in the interim, have not been sufficiently mitigated.\u201d On Saturday, the Norwegian government\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, which holds 28 million shares of Tesla, according to its most recent filing, said it had voted those shares against the pay package, adding that it did the same back in 2018. \u201cWhile we appreciate the significant value generated under Mr. Musk\u2019s leadership since the grant date in 2018, we remain concerned about the total size of the award, the structure given performance triggers, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk,\u201d said its statement. It said it had voted in favor of the shift of incorporation to Texas. On X, Musk criticized the the decision of the sovereign fund to vote no. \u201cYeah, this is not cool,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIf they actually surveyed their constituents, they would discover overwhelming support in favor. So far, roughly 90% of retail shareholders who have voted have voted in favor of both resolutions. The public sentiment is unequivocally supportive.\u201d In her decision throwing out the original package, McCormick rejected the argument that Musk would be uncompensated if the package was thrown out, writing, \u201cMusk\u2019s preexisting equity stake provided him tens of billions of dollars for his efforts.\u201d And it could continue to be up to the courts in Delaware to decide if Musk gets the options restored, no matter how the shareholders vote this month, and whether or not they approve incorporating in Texas. The attorneys for Tesla have told the court in Delaware that the companies\u2019 desire to move its incorporation to Texas is not an effort to evade jurisdiction from the original court order in Delaware as that case is appealed. But the outcome of the vote could decide how much Musk wants to continue to be involved with Tesla, the company that made him so rich and so famous before he became so controversial.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/business/elon-musk-pay-package-shareholder-vote/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_business_adults-preschoolers-toy-buying", "text": "Adults bought more toys for themselves than for any other age group last quarter for the first time ever, surpassing toys for even the historically-dominant preschooler market.  Consumers 18 years of age and up spent $1.5 billion in toy-related purchases in the period from January through April, overtaking the three-to five-year-old demographic as the most important age group for the toy industry, according to a new report from market research firm Circana. Looking back over a longer period, the report said as many as 43% of adults purchased a toy for themselves in the past year, with the top reasons being for personal fun, socialization and for collecting. Trading cards, Squishmallows (which are a rage across age groups), Lego sets and sports toys were among the most sought-after toy products in the period, the report said. As adults play with toys more and more, the trend bodes well to counter the decline in overall toy sales. Circana said toy industry dollar sales declined by 1% through April, versus the same period a year ago but are still up 38% compared to 2019. \u201cTailwinds, like the growing adult toy market and spending power of higher income households and grandparents, drive positive trends,\u201d Juli Lennett, vice president and toy industry advisor at Circana, said in the report. \u201cHowever, headwinds like rising household debt, slowing GDP growth, and fluctuating consumer confidence indicate potential challenges. \u201c Key part of \u2018adulting\u2019 involves toys While adults have always bought toys for themselves, fueled by the collector market for brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels, that niche market, industry experts said, has gone mainstream in the last five years. The pandemic was an important catalyst for it. \u201cDuring the pandemic, when people were flush with cash and had time to spend at home whether with their families or alone, they wanted to reconnect with the toys that made them happy as kids,\u201d said James Zahn, Editor in Chief of industry trade publication The Toy Book, in an interview with CNN. But people who were already toy collectors by that point ramped up their interest. \u201cWe\u2019re talking everything, dolls, action figures and diecast vehicles,\u201d he said. \u201cOutside of collectibles, boardgames, Lego building sets, trading cards, which are extraordinarily hot again, are also firing up adult interest.\u201d Some toymakers, he said, are now introducing new products straight for the adult population. \u201cJanuary Through April, in the actions figure category, the top two new items that came out were both items that kids are not going to buy,\u201d Zahn said. \u201cThe No. 1 item is the X-Men 97 Marvel Legends action figure collection from Hasbro, inspired by an animated series geared towards an adult audience.\u201d The second buzziest new item in the period is a Star Wars The Black Series Clone Caption Rex role play helmet from Hasbro. \u201cIt is a $130 collectible that essentially looks like a movie prop,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, old-fashioned modeling kits that were once popular with older shoppers have been replaced by Lego sets. \u201cThat very therapeutic idea of sitting down to create something of your own as an adult has a new format from a traditional model kit to a building set,\u201d Zahn set. \u201cLego gets a ton of that 18 and older market.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/business/adults-preschoolers-toy-buying/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

Seat control switches on the front power seats of the SUVs can become misaligned and stuck if they\u2019re hit hard by something, according to recall documents filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. If that happens, a small electric motor that moves the seat can run continuously and overheat. The recall involves 2020 through 2024 Kia Telluride models. The Telluride, a roomy SUV with three rows of seats, has been an extremely popular model for the Korean automaker. Designed in California and built in Georgia, the Telluride was created specifically to appeal to Americans. When it first came out, dealers were unable to keep enough in stock for customers. The problem was first noticed by Kia in 2022 when a customer reported smoke coming from under their Telluride\u2019s driver seat, according to a timeline Kia provided NHTSA. In 2023, another customer complained of a smoke smell from the passenger-side power seat, which wasn\u2019t working. Other similar cases were reported later that year. In 2024, at least one Kia owner reported that the driver\u2019s seat caught fire while they were driving. There have been no accidents or injuries as a result of the problem, according to Kia. An investigation by Kia concluded that the problem was with the power seat switches that could be damaged in a way that causes its motor to overheat. Kia will send recalled vehicle owners letters, starting at the end of July, asking them to bring their SUVs to a Kia dealership for repairs \u2014 at no cost. Service technicians at the dealers will install reinforcements and improved switches to prevent the seats from burning. Owners who suspect their Telluride might be involved can also call Kia customer service at 1-800-333-4542. Kia recalled more than 400,000 Tellurides earlier this year for a separate problem that could allow them to roll away while in park.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/business/kia-recalling-463000-telluride-suvs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_business_janet-yellen-artificial-intelligence", "text": "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is expected to warn bankers and tech executives on Thursday that while artificial intelligence could open the door to vast rewards for the financial system, the technology also threatens to introduce new dangers, according to speech excerpts shared first with CNN. Yellen\u2019s speech at a\u00a0conference on financial stability\u00a0represents her most extensive remarks to date on AI. It comes as investors\u00a0scramble to get a piece of the AI boom, tech giants embark on an AI arms race and regulators worry about\u00a0what could go wrong. \u201cThe tremendous opportunities and significant risks associated with the use of AI by financial companies has moved this issue toward the top\u201d of financial regulators\u2019 agendas, Yellen plans to say in the prepared remarks to be delivered at the conference, which is being held on Thursday at the US Treasury Department and on Friday at the Brookings Institution. The event, including Yellen\u2019s remarks, are set to be live-streamed. On the opportunity side, Yellen will note how AI has already been used by investors to support forecasting and portfolio management and by banks to fight fraud and support customer service, according to the prepared remarks. Going forward, Yellen is expected to say AI\u2019s \u201crapid evolution\u201d could pave the way to make financial services cheaper and easier to access, pointing specifically to advances in natural language processing, image recognition and generative AI. AI chatbots, including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini, have captivated users with their abilities. The latest AI tools can almost instantly conjure up images, spit out song lyrics and some can even generate movie-quality videos. Yellen herself has experimented with AI chatbots, a Treasury official told CNN. \u201cI know all of you here also recognize that the use of AI by financial institutions comes with risks alongside these opportunities,\u201d Yellen said in the prepared remarks. A Treasury official told CNN that the conference is expected to include a mix of regulators, tech executives, asset managers, insurers, academics, civil society organizations and small and large banks. Last December, a team of leading US regulators led by Yellen\u00a0warned for the first time that AI poses a risk to the financial system.\u00a0The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a SWAT team of regulators formed after the 2008 financial crisis, formally designated AI as an \u201cemerging vulnerability.\u201d In her speech, Yellen plans to spell out what could go wrong in financial markets. For instance, Yellen will note that the \u201ccomplexity and opacity\u201d of AI models could cause problems. The problem is that many AI models operate as a \u201cblack box,\u201d meaning their inner workings are impenetrable to outsiders. If Wall Street firms are relying on mysterious AI models, regulators will struggle to understand how safe their systems truly are. Yellen plans to also cite \u201cinadequate risk management frameworks\u201d around AI risks and \u201cinterconnections that emerge as many market participants rely on the same data and models.\u201d In other words, if many investors are all relying on tools that produce the same outcome, it could cause crowded market positions that exacerbate market moves, both to the upside or downside. Likewise, Yellen will say there is a \u201cconcentration\u201d risk linked to the fact that there are only a few companies providing AI models. That means if one goes down, many Wall Street firms could be impacted. Another concern: AI models can at times\u00a0churn out biased results. And that could be a major problem in the real world, especially when it comes to making financial decisions like who gets a loan. \u201cInsufficient or faulty data could also perpetuate or introduce new biases in financial decision making,\u201d Yellen will say, according to the prepared remarks. One major challenge facing AI that Yellen does not address in her speech excerpts: so-called hallucinations. AI models have a history of making stuff up, often in a convincing way. Such\u00a0hallucinations have previously gotten lawyers in trouble\u00a0when they cited case law that did not exist. Yellen is expected to emphasize that regulators plan to continue to monitor AI\u2019s impact on financial stability. Given how fast AI is evolving, Yellen will say that regulators and the industry can use scenario analysis to better understand \u201cfuture vulnerabilities\u201d and what can be done to \u201cenhance resilience.\u201d A Treasury official told CNN that FSOC is working to connect the dots on how AI could pose a threat to the financial system, including by ramping up efforts to monitor how it\u2019s already being used. Of course, US officials themselves are leaning on AI to do their jobs. For instance, the IRS announced last September that it has started\u00a0deploying AI to detect tax cheats. And in February, the Treasury Department disclosed it has\u00a0quietly deployed AI to catch bad guys trying to steal from taxpayers. Treasury plans to do even more with AI in the future. \u201cWe\u2019ve engaged with the public and private sectors on using AI to detect some of the greatest risks we face, from money laundering, to terrorist financing, to sanctions evasion,\u201d Yellen plans to say.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/business/janet-yellen-artificial-intelligence/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_tech_apple-ai-next-big-thing", "text": "Apple just kicked off a brand new era for the company with the introduction of its first generative AI features for the iPhone. At its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, the company unveiled the first batch of tools powered by \u201cApple Intelligence,\u201d from personalized Genmoji \u2013 Apple\u2019s AI-generated emoji \u2013 to a significantly smarter Siri, which can answer questions about your schedule, what\u2019s in your email and what time your loved one\u2019s flight is landing. It also announced a partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI to power the features. Although the partnership will likely give the company a much-needed boost, Apple aligning itself with a company and a technology that have yet to win public trust, facing criticism for taking user inputs and incorporating them into ChatGPT\u2019s data set may cause some challenges down the road. Apple emphasized privacy and security during its presentation, noting most AI functions will be done on the phone, keeping inputs away from a far-off server cloud. A big push into AI could spur growth for iPhone sales and services for years to come, as users are now waiting longer to upgrade their devices and an uncertain economic environment weighs on consumers, particularly in China. The company also faces regulatory scrutiny in Washington and was passed this week by chip maker Nvidia as the second-largest public company in the US. The company said it\u2019s been impressed with the generative AI tools already on the market, but wanted to make it more personal with privacy in mind. \u201cAs we look to build in these incredible new capabilities, we want to ensure that the outcome reflects the principles at the core of our products, it has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the keynote. \u201cIt has to be intuitive and easy to use. It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences.\u201d He added: \u201cMost importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications, and more. And, of course, it has to be built with privacy, from the ground up.\u201d The timing is also noteworthy: Apple is not always first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the most cutting-edge technology. Here\u2019s a closer look at what Apple announced at its big event: AI, AI and more AI Apple is embracing generative AI \u2013 the buzzy form of artificial intelligence that can provide thoughtful and thorough responses to questions \u2013 through Siri, the company\u2019s virtual assistant with a hit-or-miss track record, essentially turning it into an iPhone chatbot. This could enable Siri to perform specific tasks such as recalling a picture taken years ago on the device or answering detailed questions about the weather, the news or trivia. It can also perform more advanced tasks, such as answering when a user\u2019s mom\u2019s plane is landing, by analyzing information previously sent in an email. Over time, it could learn the user\u2019s preferences and respond accordingly. This is not unlike what some competitors have already introduced in generative tools. Siri will also likely adapt automatically and seamlessly to users, based on voice, audio and natural language, along with images and contextual cues. Users will also be able to create personalized photos, such as taking a picture of your mom and making it into a stylized, cartoon-y version, adding a superhero cape. It can take action across apps, including asking the software to pull up all photos of a family member, and retrieve and analyze data from across your apps, such as factoring in what\u2019s on your screen like email or a calendar. If a meeting is being rescheduled, Apple Intelligence can process relevant personal data and see the email your kid sent days before about a recital, alerting users if there may be a conflict. In a Q&A following the keynote, Cook once again said the company is taking privacy and security very seriously with the rollout of the new technology. \u201cWe think AI\u2019s role is not to replace users but to empower them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you think about what\u2019s possible, it has to be integrated with the experience and be intuitive, and informed by your personal context and knowledge of you. If you\u2019re going to do that, there\u2019s a lot of responsibility.\u201d Beyond AI Apple kicked off its iOS 18 portion of the event by highlighting new controls and personalization coming to iOS 18, including a revamped look for all icons when it goes into Dark Mode, a new tint color that compliments wallpaper and a redesigned control center that is available from the lock screen, so you can swap the flashlight icon for other tools. Apple said it is also doubling down on privacy and security, such as giving users the option to \u201clock\u201d certain apps, making them accessible only via Face ID, Touch ID or a user\u2019s passcode. The feature could be especially helpful to protect apps like a banking app, an insurance app, or if you\u2019re handing your phone over to show off photos or get someone\u2019s phone number. Users can now also \u201chide\u201d an app, so it will show up only in a locked, hidden folder. And media from hidden apps won\u2019t show up anywhere else on their phone. Text messages are getting a bump, too. The company said it will soon let people send texts via satellite, even if they don\u2019t have a cell or WiFi connection. Apple is also adding what it called one of the most requested features in iMessage: the ability to schedule messages .iPhone users will now be able to record and create transcripts of calls right from the phone app. All parties to the call will be notified when it is being recorded. Other product updates The company also made software updates to other products, including the Mac, AirPods and Apple Watch. Apple showed off its latest MacOS software called Sequoia, with a handful of new productivity features. Phone mirroring, for example, will bring iPhone alerts directly to the laptop that show up directly next to Mac notifications. MacOS will also support the ability to arrange windows open on screen in certain areas, such as side by side \u2014 a concept popularized by Microsoft Windows. Video conferencing is getting a presenter preview, so users can see what they\u2019re going to share before they share it. Apple is also introducing background replacements on calls, so users can hide the laundry behind them. Meanwhile, AirPods users will be able to answer or decline a call with just a nod or shake of their head. And new vital sign tracking on Apple Watch can notify users when they may be getting sick, based on signals like body temperature and heart rate. Vision Pro update Just a few months after its launch, Apple showed off a few upgrades coming to the software that powers its Vision Pro mixed reality headset. During its most recent earnings call, Cook said more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought an Apple Vision Pro. \u201c[We] are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren\u2019t possible before,\u201d he added. Vision OS 2 promises to offer more rich experiences for users, such as a wider display for work stations, new hand gestures that let you check battery life or open up the home screen, and get deeper inside the photos in your library, thanks to advanced machine learning that provides more natural depth. The company said it is also adding more capability for users to capture spatial videos. Apple is also bringing Vision Pro to more countries, including the UK, China, Japan Singapore and Australia, this summer. Upgrades could also boost sales of the pricey Vision Pro, which starts at $3,499. Demand for Apple\u2019s new headset has\u00a0reportedly\u00a0been weak.

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. How do we know if the economy is in decline? The answer might be on our lips. Estee Lauder chairman Leonard Lauder created the lipstick index during the economic downturn following September 11, 2001. He noticed that the purchase of cosmetics, lipsticks in particular, tend to be inversely related to the economy because women replace more expensive purchases with small pick-me-ups. In fall 2001, US lipstick sales increased by 11%. And back during the Great Depression, cosmetics sales overall increased by 25%. In 2020, at the height of the Covid economic downturn, Estee Lauder\u2019s CEO Fabrizio Freda said that the lipstick index had been replaced by a skincare item as customers donned masks and worked from home. \u201cThe lipstick index has been substituted with the moisturizing index,\u201d said Freda. \u201cBut the concept of the index is still there.\u201d Now we may be seeing that phenomenon rear its head once more. Sephora recently announced a record sales year and data from consumer research group Circana shows that prestige beauty growth has outpaced mass beauty sales, growing 9% and 2%, respectively in the first quarter of the year. Of course, the so-called lipstick index is a less technical \u2014 and more fun \u2014 measure of\u00a0economic downturn and isn\u2019t always entirely accurate. But as the free-spending post-pandemic\u00a0party comes to an end in the US, it\u2019s something worth exploring. Before the Bell spoke with Neela Montgomery, CEO of Overeon (a collective of premium cosmetics brands including BareMinerals, Laura Mercier, and Buxom) about the outlook for beauty in an uncertain economic climate. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Before the Bell: We\u2019ve been writing a lot at CNN about how Americans are beginning to rein in their spending. Consumers seem to be taking a hit right now. But data shows that more expensive prestige beauty sales are outpacing mass, lower-priced beauty sales. How do you explain that? Neela Montgomery: Beauty shifted a bit during the Covid times because it became self-care purchase orientated. I do think that\u2019s making it more resilient to broader economic trends. As people are thinking about where to reduce spending, it\u2019s more likely to be in fashion and very high-priced discretionary goods than beauty. What\u2019s very interesting about beauty and one of the things I really like about the industry is that we continue to innovate, it\u2019s fast-paced and there are new trends all the time for people to keep up with. So Bare Minerals Lip Gloss Balm is a huge new product for us\u2026it\u2019s like a micro-moment of pleasure that people can treat themselves to. I think that is still very appealing and seems relatively easy to access for $24. So I think that is why it\u2019s more resilient. It\u2019s more about the comparative nature of prices and what customers are using products for. Do you think the industry has been just resilient or have you seen a boost? I think if you look at the broader prestige market, it\u2019s been enormously resilient across all demographics including age and income. Skincare drove a lot of that for a while and now fragrance and makeup are dominating again. The category remains way, way higher than one would expect. It\u2019s a considered purchase, but it\u2019s not so discretionary that it\u2019s unobtainable. You mentioned that trends move quickly in the beauty industry, are TikTok and other social platforms driving sales and have you adjusted your products based on influencer trends?\u00a0 Well, Laura Mercier is very much about a flawless face and what makes you unique makes you beautiful so we recognize that a trend like glassy skin is not for that brand. But the latte look could be, so we think about it more in terms of palette trends. For example, we\u2019re about to launch a caviar matte lipstick, and matte lipstick has definitely made a huge comeback \u2013 it\u2019s also super popular in Asia, which is a very high growth part of our business. So we think about overall trends and then TikTok trends specifically where they\u2019re relevant. We can\u2019t respond to every microtrend, we\u2019re not in that kind of development cycle, but if it relates to our brand, how we then go to market and talk about it very much resonates on TikTok. And then the other thing I would say about TikTok that I think is fascinating is the role of these communities. Social selling has become almost 20% of our brand .com sales. That\u2019s a really interesting and important trend because what matters these days for a brand is what people say about you to each other rather than what you say about yourself. What do you see dominating the beauty market in the second half of the year?\u00a0 Clean has become a real buzzword in this industry, but this whole idea of no-tox (anti-botox), remains a really important thing\u2026 The market is bifurcating between this very authentic, real look and people who are getting more cosmetic work done. What we see is a need for more of these kinds of efficacious products for people who don\u2019t want to go down the cosmetic procedure route or injectables route. And then we continue to see that sort of clean girl with a pop of color look. So you know, we have this sort of red lip\u2026We continue to see that grow and expand. I think what\u2019s fascinating is how informed people are about ingredients \u2013 whether it\u2019s a sesame seed extract in the lip gloss, or using sea buckthorn or just being educated around some of these unique natural ingredients that have, probably not the same efficacy, but have efficacy as well compared to more more obvious things like retinol. As AI booms, Microsoft\u2019s deal with a startup comes under federal investigation The Federal Trade Commission is investigating a recent Microsoft deal with artificial intelligence startup Inflection, according to a person familiar with the matter, as US antitrust regulators ramp up scrutiny of the red-hot AI industry. Microsoft announced in March that it had\u00a0hired Inflection\u2019s co-founders\u00a0and a number of its staff to lead its Copilot program, and Inflection said its AI model\u00a0would be hosted\u00a0on Microsoft\u2019s cloud platform. As part of that deal, Microsoft was\u00a0said to have paid Inflection $650 million. In its announcement at the time, Microsoft described the move\u00a0as merely a hiring decision, not as an acquisition. The FTC probe into Microsoft concerns whether the company\u2019s investment in Inflection constituted an acquisition that Microsoft failed to disclose to the government, one of the people said. The investigation comes as antitrust officials at the FTC and the Justice Department are nearing a final agreement this week on how to jointly oversee AI giants such as Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, OpenAI and others, two people familiar with the matter told CNN. That agreement, which could be finalized within days, would appoint the DOJ as the lead investigator of Nvidia, while the FTC would take responsibility for investigating Microsoft and OpenAI, the people said. DOJ will likely continue its role in overseeing Google, one of the people indicated. Any investigations would focus on whether the companies have used their dominant positions in the AI industry to harm competition through abusive and illegal behavior. The agreement shows enforcers are poised for a broad crackdown on some of the most well-known players in the AI sector, said Sarah Myers West, managing director of the AI Now Institute and a former AI advisor to the FTC. \u201cClearance processes like this are usually a key step before advancing an investigation,\u201d West said. \u201cThis is a clear sign they\u2019re moving quickly here.\u201d Microsoft declined to comment on the DOJ-FTC agreement but, in a statement, defended its partnership with Inflection.

{"id": "2024_06_05_business_lululemon-is-at-a-crossroads", "text": "Lululemon, maker of the pricey yogawear sported by seemingly everyone from Pilates moms to college students to preteens in the US, is at a crossroads. For over a decade, the company has fought off competitors like Athleta and Nike to dominate the luxury athleisure market, managing to grow despite the lightning rod of controversies that followed its founder. Its soft, colorful, $98 leggings and viral beltbags have attracted an even younger demographic, a huge plus for any retailer. But, while the skin-tight look shot Lululemon to fame, it now must navigate a new, baggy pant-loving Gen Z demographic and the radical reshuffling of its own executive team. Lulu stock is down almost 40% year to date but rose more than 10% after hours on Wednesday, after slightly topping analyst revenue expectations in its first quarter 2024 earnings. Macroeconomic headwinds are hitting many peer retailers, of course. But Lulu is also coping with the addition of trendy, celebrity and influencer-backed competitors like Alo, which is known for its monochromatic, chic sets, and Vuori, which carved out a space for itself in men\u2019s athleticwear. And the company blamed its slower North American sales on its own actions: It just didn\u2019t have enough sizes and colors in stock for its youngest customers. Lulu recently announced that its chief product officer \u2013 considered by Wall Street a key engine of its success \u2013 was leaving just ahead of its first quarter earnings release Wednesday. As part of that release, Lululemon said it was raising its stock repurchase program by $1 billion, which could help calm down investors who are worried abut slowed growth. The company also maintained a brighter outlook for the year, saying it expects its net revenue to be between $10.7 billion and $10.8 billion. A departure shakes the firm Sun Choe, who had been Lululemon\u2019s creative mastermind, recently resigned to join Vans as its global brand president. The departure of the company\u2019s chief product officer adds to a \u201cwall of worry\u201d Raymond James analysts said. Choe joined Lululemon more than seven years ago and became chief product officer in 2018, according to her LinkedIn. Raymond James analysts credit Lululemon\u2019s success with strong products and marketing to Choe\u2019s role at the company. Shares fell as much as 7% on May 22 upon news of her departure. She left big shoes to fill, Wedbush analyst Tom Nikic told CNN. Under Choe, there was \u201cconstant innovation and newness, whether it\u2019s new fabrics or getting into new product categories.\u201d There\u2019s a reason Wall Street responded so negatively to Choe\u2019s departure. \u201cI think that there\u2019s a lot of people out there who believe that she was the person behind the scenes and was the most instrumental to Lululemon\u2019s success,\u201d Nikic said. Competition on both sides The fashion the company was known for has already been on the way out, Jefferies analysts warned. They \u201cbelieve the company\u2019s product assortment is falling flat.\u201d Lululemon is getting walled in by two very different types of competitors. On one end is those rapidly expanding luxury yogawear brands Alo and Vuori, who have been opening stores  near existing Lululemon locations. And then there\u2019s the culture of dupes, which claim leggings just as soft as Lulu\u2019s can be purchased for a fraction of the price. Lulu has been\u00a0\u201chyper aware\u201d of dupe culture, Nikki Neuburger, then its Chief Brand Officer, previously said in an interview with CNN Business. So much so that the brand hosted a dupe swap at the Century City Mall in Los Angeles. Bring in a knock-off pair, Lulu said, and they\u2019ll swap it out for the black Align High Rise Pant 25\u2019. That wasn\u2019t enough to quell knock-off popularity. As Americans cut back spending due to inflation and rising prices, many view a $90 pair of leggings as an unnecessary expense. And for those who can still shell out the money, Lululemon faces steep competition. Alo shot to popularity after celebrities from Hailey Bieber to Martha Stewart were photographed in the trendy brand. Vuori has a $400 million investment by Softbank and said it had bullish plans to open more than 100 stores in the US in the next five years. Time to turn it around Lululemon\u2019s demographic has shifted \u2013 originally marketed toward suburban women in their 30s and 40s, its stores are increasingly filled with younger, close to preteen-aged shoppers. In its Q4 earnings call in March, Lululemon said it had seen strong sales of its smaller sizes and colorful offerings. However, Lululemon wasn\u2019t stocked enough in these smaller sizes, which could have led these younger shoppers to competitors, Nikic said. But these are quick fixable problems, Nikic said. CEO Calvin McDonald made clear the company was still focused on pursuing\u00a0its new core customer in its last earnings call. (Lululemon has not responded to request for comment for this story in advance of their Wednesday earnings.) Lululemon also has potential for growth in its men\u2019s sector and international business. Unlike athletic brands like Nike that have a huge international footprint, Lululemon\u2019s international business represented only 21% of its business at the end of 2023. The company said in the fourth quarter that its mainland China revenue increased 78%, compared to North America\u2019s revenue increase of 9%. \u201cI certainly would not say that hope is lost with this company. This is a company that has a long track record of success,\u201d Nikic said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/business/lululemon-is-at-a-crossroads/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_business_vintage-collectible-toys-market-sale", "text": "An action figure from 1979 that was never officially released in stores has become the most valuable vintage toy ever sold at auction, fetching a final bid that could buy a three-bedroom, two-bath home in many parts of the United States. The Rocket-Firing Boba Fett action figure, modeled after the \u201cStar Wars\u201d bounty hunter, was purchased in Dallas by an anonymous buyer for $525,000, Heritage Auctions announced last Monday. It dethroned Barbie from the No. 1 spot she had held since 2010, when a version of the iconic doll with a necklace of real diamonds sold at a Christie\u2019s auction for $302,500. Pricey efforts by collectors to get their hands on specific toys are par for the course in this niche field, one that can be lucrative but also one where pricing is opaque and volatile and many of the most expensive deals are brokered privately among hobbyists. Part of what makes almost any memorabilia market so speculative and unstable, especially one based on entertainment, is that it\u2019s governed by sentiment and nostalgia. Those who grew up playing with the earliest action figures in the 1970s and 1980s now have the money to spend on some of the toys they had (or couldn\u2019t have) as kids, and many hobbyists are willing to pour a lot of money into rare vintage toys. \u201cI have a lot more disposable income now than I did when I was collecting toys as a kid,\u201d said Justin Caravoulias, the Action Figures & Toys consignment director at Heritage Auctions, whose own collection includes a range of G.I. Joe action figures from the 1960s to present day. \u201cPeople my age have the disposable income to say, \u2018I want that $100 Rambo figure, I want that $400 Hot Toys Star Wars figure or, hey, I want the $525,000 Boba Fett figure.\u2019 So the people who have grown up with it have matured to the point where they can spend some real money on these things.\u201d And while that old toy box in the back of that closet full of beat-up He-Man, Batman and Barbie dolls almost certainly won\u2019t be worth as much as the jackpot Boba Fett, adults today are increasingly gravitating toward buying toys for themselves \u2014 perhaps invigorating new collectible markets down the road. The toy that never was The \u201cRocket Fett,\u201d as it is sometimes called, was part of a mail-away promotion from American toy maker Kenner, which had sold popular toys from properties like \u201cStar Wars\u201d and \u201cBatman.\u201d Under the promotion, anyone who provided proof of purchasing four \u201cStar Wars\u201d action figures would be mailed a Boba Fett figure that had a rocket launcher on its back. But Kenner ultimately decided to attach the plastic rocket onto the toy because it posed a choking hazard to children. The figures came with a \u201cNote to Customers\u201d from the company explaining the change. While no rocket-firing toys were mailed out, a number of them were saved by Kenner employees before the company destroyed its stock. Toy dealer Brian Rachfal, who represented the seller in the Heritage auction, estimates there are about 100 rocket-firing models of various types in circulation among vintage toy collectors and hobbyists. Some have even gone as far as tracking down former Kenner employees to purchase the models they saved, a dogged determination that\u2019s typical in many collectible markets where interpersonal deals still reign supreme. Dolls are for girls, action figures are for boys Unlike fine art or sports memorabilia, the collectible action figure market is only a handful of decades old because action figures have only been around since the mid-1960s. \u201cThe first action figure was G.I. Joe in 1964,\u201d said Caravoulias. He recounted how Hasbro executive Don Levine coined the term \u201caction figure\u201d as a marketing tool, because \u201cwe can\u2019t call these dolls. Boys do not want to play with \u2018dolls.\u2019\u201d Even today, toy experts tell CNN that action figure collectors tend to overwhelmingly be men, many in high-powered professions like finance and the entertainment industry. The market took off in the 1970s and 1980s with properties like \u201cStar Wars,\u201d \u201cMasters of the Universe\u201d and \u201cTransformers.\u201d At the time, these action figures were simply that: toys meant to be played with and stored in a toy bin or the family playroom. \u201cNobody saved them in the box, because why would you? You you can\u2019t play with it while it\u2019s in the box,\u201d said Caravoulias. \u201cThere were very few people who are actually collecting them in this sense that we know today, as something that would be worth anything in the future.\u201d By the 1990s, adults driven by nostalgia began seeking out the toys they grew up with. Increased demand \u2014 coupled with the fact that it was rare to find these toys in original packaging \u2014 pushed prices for pristine-condition action figures even higher, a trend that continues today. According to Caravoulias, the value of a piece is driven by its popularity among collectors, its condition and how common it is to find it in its original packaging. Action figures lose their collectability if they\u2019re all saved in pristine condition. Price is typically subject to the buyers and sellers in any given transaction. With public auctions, the bidders set the ultimate dollar value, while experts can give a range of how much a product might be worth. But even that can change depending on demand among other factors. In 2012, a similar Rocket Fett would have sold for $15,000, said Caravoulias. Other experts note that the items with the highest price tags typically change hands in private sales. Tom Derby, a strategic analyst at Collectible Investment Brokerage who authenticates high-end collectibles, told CNN he facilitates about $10 million in transactions per year. The largest private sale he has ever brokered was for the original wax sculpture model of the first Darth Vader action figure for just under $1.2 million. \u201cThe problem with the private sales is you don\u2019t know really what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Rachfal. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re cash, sometimes they\u2019re cash and trade. Sometimes the yields can drag out. So it\u2019s really kind of hard to compare. It\u2019s not necessarily apples to apples.\u201d Nostalgia drives a lucrative market Many vintage toy collectors enter the hobby out of passion and nostalgia, experts say. Caravoulias recalls laying in bed as a kid in 1985 and wishing he could buy a $5 Rambo II action figure. As with anything collectible, at times people find it hard to put a dollar amount on a piece they\u2019re attached to and are reluctant to part with it regardless of the potential monetary value attached. Rachfal says the showcase of his collection \u2014 which at one time included 11 Rocket-Firing Boba Fett figures \u2014 has several pieces he can\u2019t imagine parting with. \u201cI don\u2019t know what type of money a person could offer me that would not make me cringe for the rest of my life as I walked by that showcase and the pieces aren\u2019t there,\u201d he said. \u201cMoney doesn\u2019t always talk in the hobby. What makes some of these pieces so desirable is because you just can\u2019t get them.\u201d Those who acquire the most valuable pieces are protective of their privacy over fears of theft and to avoid being harangued by other overeager toy buyers. According to Derby, over the past four years, one buyer is a \u201chousehold name\u201d who bought the majority of the best pieces. Caravoulias recommends people collect whatever sparks their interest, as they\u2019re more likely to be better informed about the market if they\u2019re invested emotionally, not just financially, in their collection. When it comes to toys, he says the safest investment are properties that have maintained their relevance for multiple generations and continue reinventing themselves, like \u201cStar Wars\u201d and \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\u201d \u201cI think that \u2018Power Rangers\u2019 will be the next one that comes up,\u201d Caravoulias added. \u201cKids played with them and adults really didn\u2019t think to save them. There are packaged examples out there, but they\u2019re not in collector-grade condition. And I think a lot of people will come back and want to collect what they had when they were a kid, probably in the original packaging.\u201d On the other hand, he cited \u201cBeanie Babies\u201d as \u201ca study in what not to do,\u201d referring to the 1990s craze over the plush toys that spurred hysteria among collectors. \u201cBeanie Babies\u201d were manufactured to be collectible, with a limited number of toys released for each series and some pieces that were discontinued seemingly at random. Interest plummeted after a few years, and the value of the stuffed animals likewise crashed. \u201cThe hugest missing component of \u2018Beanie Babies\u2019 is they were collectible right from the beginning,\u201d Caravoulias said. \u201cThey were collected because there was scarcity. And they were fun to collect. But they had no nostalgia because they were collected right off the bat.\u201d Adults dominate the toy market for the first time ever Even beyond rare and collectible pieces, adults are now the most lucrative cohort for the toy industry, beating out preschoolers for the first time ever. In the first quarter of 2024, those 18 and older spent more than $1.5 billion on toys for themselves, according to a report published Thursday by market research firm Circana. Nearly half of adults who bought a toy for themselves in the past 12 months cited \u201csocialization, enjoyment, and collecting\u201d as their motivation. According to Circana, last year\u2019s highest selling toy properties included \u201cPok\u00e9mon,\u201d \u201cBarbie,\u201d \u201cStar Wars\u201d and \u201cHot Wheels.\u201d All of these properties have extensive vintage catalogues, and their enduring relevance and legacy have only propelled prices for older items in the more niche vintage toy market. Some experts say the pandemic was a catalyst for adults\u2019 mainstream interest in toys. \u201cDuring the pandemic, when people were flush with cash and had time to spend at home whether with their families or alone, they wanted to reconnect with the toys that made them happy as kids,\u201d James Zahn, editor-in-chief of industry trade publication The Toy Book, told CNN. But toy collectors by that point had already ramped up their interest. \u201cWe\u2019re talking everything \u2014 dolls, action figures and die-cast vehicles,\u201d he said. \u201cOutside of collectibles, there are boardgames, Lego building sets, and trading cards, (which are extraordinarily hot again) that are also firing up adult interest.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/business/vintage-collectible-toys-market-sale/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_tech_apple-wwdc-event-2024", "text": "Apple is on the verge of kicking off perhaps its most important event in years as it faces a gauntlet of challenges. At its annual Worldwide Developers Conference starting Monday, the company is widely expected to announce a partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI and unveil the first batch of generative AI tools coming to its mobile operating system. A big push into AI could spur growth for iPhone sales and services for years to come, as users are now waiting longer to upgrade their devices and an uncertain economic environment weighs on consumers, particularly in China. The company also faces regulatory scrutiny in Washington and was passed this week by chip maker Nvidia as the second-largest public company in the US. \u201cWe see generative AI as a key opportunity across our products and believe we have advantages that set us apart there,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the company\u2019s most recent earnings call in early May, noting the company would announce news in the \u201cweeks ahead.\u201d The timing is also noteworthy: Apple is not always first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the most cutting-edge technology. According to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, the company going all in on AI will \u201ckick off a new frontier for Apple\u201d \u2013 one that will have a lasting impact on its products and services. Here\u2019s a closer look at what to expect at Apple\u2019s big event: AI, AI and more AI Apple is expected to call its AI initiative \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d and make opt-in only. It will require an iPhone 15 Pro or a device with an M1 chip or newer, according to a new report by Bloomberg. Perhaps the most obvious way Apple could embrace generative AI \u2013 the buzzy form of artificial intelligence that can provide thoughtful and thorough responses to questions \u2013 is through Siri, the company\u2019s virtual assistant with a hit-or-miss track record. An integration with OpenAI\u2019s latest ChatGPT-4o model could catapult Siri years forward by turning the feature into an iPhone chatbot. This could enable Siri to perform specific tasks such as recalling a picture taken years ago on the device or answering detailed questions about the weather, the news or trivia. Over time, it could learn the user\u2019s preferences and even personality, and respond accordingly. Looking at how competitors have already introduced generative tools, AI-powered features for the iPhone could also likely assist users with summarizing and drafting emails or bringing information up on a device\u2019s screen with a finger gesture. It will also likely adapt automatically and seamlessly to users, based on voice, audio and natural language, along with images and contextual cues. \u201cGenerative AI will allow the next generations of iPhones to become a sixth sense, empowering us to scan and interact with the world around us,\u201d Thomas Husson, an analyst with market research firm Forrester, told CNN. It could also mean changes for Apple\u2019s whole ecosystem by embedding AI within its own apps, such as Apple Maps, iMovie and iPhoto. Some analysts expect Apple to release tools for brand developers and app makers to create new experiences. Reece Hayden, a senior analyst at ABI Research, said he expects the demos during the event to highlight points where on-device AI brings additional value. He also believes Apple will spend time outlining its long-term vision. \u201cAI will increasingly be foundational to Apple\u2019s entire strategic focus, so it will highlight the R&D efforts moving forward, expected investment and acquisitions that the company has made to support their proposition,\u201d he said. A strategic partnership In the spring, Apple was reportedly discussing partnership opportunities with both OpenAI and Google to power its AI tools. But now the company is believed to have inked a deal with the ChatGPT creator, a partnership Apple could elaborate on during the opening keynote on Monday. \u201cIf OpenAI is responsible for powering Apple\u2019s AI capabilities, I would expect a formal partnership announcement as consumers and enterprises want to understand the regulation and rules and what they are signing up for and how their data is being utilized,\u201d Hayden said. Although the partnership would give the company a much-needed innovation boost, it could also hinder Apple\u2019s control over product development and over the rules and regulation on data collection and privacy, Hayden said. Apple aligning itself with a company and a technology that have yet to win public trust could pose some risks for Apple down the line. OpenAI continues to face criticism over some of its practices. This week, a group of current and former OpenAI employees demanded artificial intelligence companies be far more transparent about AI\u2019s \u201cserious risks\u201d \u2014 and that they protect employees who voice concerns about the technology they\u2019re building. The group called for AI companies to foster \u201ca culture of open criticism\u201d that welcomes, rather than punishes, people who speak up about their concerns, especially as regulation struggles to catch up to the quickly advancing technology. A focus on privacy and security Apple has been long focused on consumer privacy and security, and that will likely also be reflected in Monday\u2019s announcements. Companies have acknowledged the serious risks posed by AI \u2014 from manipulation and the spread of misinformation to a loss of control that could potentially result in human extinction. Many researchers and AI workers have expressed the need to better educate the public about risks and protective measures. Apple will need to address how using this type of technology will impact consumers. Vision Pro update Apple will likely provide an update to its Vision Pro mixed reality headset, which was announced one year ago this week and released for purchase in February. During its most recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought an Apple Vision Pro. \u201c[We] are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren\u2019t possible before,\u201d he added. Generative AI could potentially propel the headset into another level of personalization and immersion and usher in new use cases for businesses, particularly in the education and medical spaces. Tuong Nygugen, a director analyst at market research firm Gartner, said any company interested in headsets \u201chas to be thinking about [AI]\u201d across all of its product lines. \u201cNobody really knows what\u2019s a winner yet, so they\u2019re pulling together all these use cases right now, with a focus on enterprise, and making a case for why this is the future of experiences and devices,\u201d he said. Upgrades could also boost sales of the pricey Vision Pro, which starts at $3,499 and has reportedly seen weak demand.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/tech/apple-wwdc-event-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_tech_hospital-cyberattack-google-microsoft", "text": "Microsoft and Google will offer free or discounted cybersecurity services to rural hospitals across the United States to make them less vulnerable to cyberattacks that have disrupted patient care and threatened lives, the White House and those tech firms said Monday. Microsoft said in a statement to CNN that it would provide free security updates for eligible rural hospitals, as well as security assessments and training for hospital staff. Google will provide free cybersecurity advice to rural hospitals and start a pilot program to match the firm\u2019s cybersecurity services with the needs of rural hospitals. The nation\u2019s roughly 1,800 rural community hospitals are among the most vulnerable to dangerous ransomware attacks because they often lack IT security resources and cybersecurity-trained staff. And they may be the only hospitals within dozens of miles, meaning a ransomware attack that prevents a hospital from accepting ambulances can put patients\u2019 lives at risk. The new announcement is\u00a0the result of private discussions between the tech firms and officials at the White House National Security Council who have growing increasingly concerned about cyber threats to hospitals. It\u2019s an effort to use the broad reach of Microsoft and Google\u2019s software, which is used in hospitals across the United States, to help plug a gap in the defense of the health care sector. \u201cWe\u2019re in new territory as we see \u2026 this wave of attacks against hospitals,\u201d Anne Neuberger, the top cyber official at the White House National Security Council, told reporters on Sunday. The Biden administration is also preparing to issue minimum cybersecurity requirements for US hospitals. The details of that proposal have yet to be finalized. But the American Hospital Association, which represents hospitals across the United States, opposes the proposal, saying it would impose penalties on the victims of cyberattacks after they are hacked. A growing problem The number of ransomware attacks against the US healthcare sector increased by 128% in 2023 compared to 2022,\u00a0according to data\u00a0released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. And recent ransomware attacks have brought the sector\u2019s vulnerability into sharp relief. A February ransomware attack on a major health insurance billing firm\u00a0cut off health providers\u00a0from billions of dollars and put some health clinics on the brink of bankruptcy. UnitedHealth Group, whose subsidiary was hacked, paid a $22 million ransom to the hackers to try to recover patient data. One third of Americans may have had their data stolen. Another ransomware attack, in May, on one of America\u2019s largest hospital chains,\u00a0put patients\u2019 lives in danger\u00a0as nurses were forced to manually enter prescription information, multiple nurses at affected hospitals told CNN. The FBI and its international allies have conducted a series of crackdowns on ransomware gangs, seizing the computers they use and unlocking some of the victim computers that hackers have encrypted. But ransomware remains a flourishing business, in part, US officials say, because many of its perpetrators operate with impunity from Russia. The health care sector is a particularly enticing target because hospitals under duress to restore patient services\u00a0are sometimes willing\u00a0to pay the ransom. \u201cWe do see a much more permissive environment in Russia by both hacktivists and criminals, and it\u2019s of concern,\u201d Neuberger, the White House official, told reporters. \u201cWe also see more and more companies paying ransoms. And every ransom payment feeds the beast and drives further attacks.\u201d Cleveland cyberattack shuts City Hall Cyberattacks have frequently shut down other vulnerable services. The\u00a0City of Cleveland is\u00a0investigating a cyber incident, according to a statement from mayor Justin\u00a0Bibb. As a precaution, the city said it closed City Hall Monday, and it will keep City Hall closed Tuesday. Cleveland also shut down all of its internal systems and software. But city and emergency services like the Department of Public Safety, 911, police, the fire department, ambulances and the Department of Public Utilities, will remain operational, Bibb\u2019s office said. However, the mayor said the emergency services are functioning with limited IT capabilities. \u201cOver the weekend, the city identified some abnormalities,\u201d Commissioner Kimberly\u00a0Roy-Wilson, with the city\u2019s Division of Information Technology Services, said. \u201cWe have moved into our protocols and procedures with regards to containment and we are now investigating the nature and scope of those abnormalities.\u201d Bibb would not say how many or which agencies are helping with the investigation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/tech/hospital-cyberattack-google-microsoft/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

Monday\u2019s survey also showed improved optimism beyond the homefront: Notably, consumers believe the markets\u2019 good times could keep rolling. Households\u2019 expectations for highest US stock prices improved to a three-year high. In terms of the labor market, the latest survey was a little mixed. Earnings growth expectations dipped slightly, while the expected probability of the national unemployment rate being higher next year increased above the 12-month trailing average. At the same time, consumers\u2019 perceived probability that they\u2019d lose their job decreased below the 12-month trailing average. The May Survey of Consumer Expectations showed a rosier picture than the New York Fed\u2019s survey a month before, which showed respondents bracing for even more expensive homes \u2014 anticipated home price growth hit a nearly two-year high \u2014 while year-ahead inflation expectations picked up to the highest level in five months. In May, home price expectations were still high, unchanged from the month before; however, inflation expectations dipped \u2014 and that\u2019s a good sign for the Federal Reserve. The Fed closely monitors gauges of near-, medium- and long-term inflation expectations as those could be self-fulfilling prophecies for consumers: If people think prices will be higher in the future, they might spend more now or even demand higher wages. In turn, businesses faced with higher costs might end up raising prices as a result. Monday\u2019s survey showed that the three- and five-year inflation expectations were unchanged. The US will get a critical read on the state of inflation this week with the release of the May Consumer Price Index on Wednesday morning. The most widely used inflation gauge is expected to show that consumer prices slowed on a monthly basis and that a key underlying inflation metric has also cooled. If the expectations hold true, that would be welcome news for Americans weighed down by three-plus years of elevated inflation, the Fed in its fight to rein in price hikes, and the markets. When the April CPI showed inflation on a cooler trajectory than it had started the year, the major US stock indexes all surged to record highs.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/economy/may-survey-consumer-expectations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_tech_ai-iphone-cool-apple-wwdc", "text": "Apple hasn\u2019t given users a significant reason to buy an upgraded iPhone for four years, since it rolled out 5G connectivity with the iPhone 12 \u2014 a worrying trend for the tech giant\u2019s core business. That could change this week. The iPhone brought in more than half of the company\u2019s total revenue last year, but sales growth has lagged as customers have been slower to upgrade to new models. Longer upgrade cycles \u2014 the time between users\u2019 new phone purchases \u2014 currently plague many device companies. But they\u2019ve been especially painful for Apple as it grapples with compounding challenges that also include steep competition in the key China market and a landmark antitrust lawsuit. Apple is expected to announce new artificial intelligence features at its annual Worldwide Developer Conference on Monday, which could supercharge its products and bring Apple back into competition with much of the rest of the tech world that has already gone full steam ahead on AI. And no product is more important to Apple than the iPhone. New AI features that provide a compelling reason to upgrade when Apple rolls out the iPhone 16 in the fall could boost the company at a crucial time. Here\u2019s the thing: No matter how Monday goes, Apple isn\u2019t losing its status as a tech powerhouse anytime soon. The company earned more than $200 billion from iPhone sales alone last year, its stock (AAPL) is up 9% over the past year and it has a healthy services business that helps to balance some of the seasonality of hardware sales. But analysts say that reinvigorating iPhone sales is key to Apple\u2019s continued growth. \u201cThis can\u2019t be another, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ll do something cool later on,\u2019 kind of presentation. They know that,\u201d D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told CNN ahead of WWDC. \u201cFor Apple\u2019s stock to work, for the business to grow, we need to hear from them why we should buy iPhone 16.\u201d Investors are also counting on Apple to prove it can hold its own in the intensely competitive AI arms race at a time when many of its peers have much more clearly articulated a strategy for the next major wave of tech development. \u201cThe timing is critical for\u00a0Apple. Nvidia just leapfrogged it as the second most valuable technology company behind Microsoft,\u201d which is also seeking to more directly compete with Apple\u2019s device business with new AI-powered PCs, eMarketer senior analyst Gadjo Sevilla said in emailed commentary. \u201cAny misstep by\u00a0Apple\u00a0at this juncture could see it lose its traction as a technology leader. \u201c Awaiting the AI iPhone Apple has for years included AI in its products in small, often invisible ways that nonetheless make life easier for its fans. But now, Apple is set to introduce its most consumer-facing AI updates yet. The company is widely expected to announce on Monday new generative AI capabilities for iOS, which could especially benefit its Siri personal assistant. An AI-powered Siri could potentially perform specific tasks such as recalling a picture taken years ago on the device or answering detailed questions about the weather, the news or trivia. Over time, it could learn the user\u2019s preferences and even personality, and respond accordingly. Based on how competitors have already begun to integrate generative AI into their devices, Apple could also introduce other tools, such as the ability to summarize or draft emails. Historically, Apple is often not the first to introduce new technology, but rather rolls out a premium experience more slowly. Now, the pressure is on for the iPhone giant to wow people with features that go beyond what competitors like Samsung and Microsoft have already introduced for their smartphones and computers. But beyond the features themselves, perhaps the biggest question going into WWDC is which Apple device owners will be able to use them: Will the new AI tools be accessible on older iPhones or will they be functional only on forthcoming devices set to launch in the fall, perhaps because of the need for powerful new chips or faster processors? The latter scenario \u2014 assuming the features are compelling \u2014 could spur the next major iPhone upgrade cycle and have ripple effects for the entire company. Luria said that boring new features or AI capability that is available to anyone with an older iPhone could cause the company\u2019s stock to drop as low as $160 per share. But exciting new technology that encourages users to upgrade in the fall could boost shares to $240 each. (Apple shares closed the day just shy of $197 on Friday.) \u201cThat\u2019s the key: if it\u2019s compelling and not backward-compatible, Apple will have the first upgrade cycle in four years,\u201d Luria said. \u201cAnd that will mean a lot for the stock because that was the last time they had a big jump.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/tech/ai-iphone-cool-apple-wwdc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

The famed meme stock icon, also known as \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d made a long-awaited appearance on a livestream on his YouTube channel Friday. Sporting long hair, a thick bandage wrapped around his head, gaudy white sunglasses, a sling and a beer, Gill livestreamed against a background of Yahoo! Finance\u2019s GameStop stock ticker page. \u201cIt\u2019s been a few years now. I hope y\u2019all are good,\u201d said Gill, a native of Brockton, Massachusetts. \u201cThis is me, by the way.

Is it someone else?\u2019 I mean, can you tell it\u2019s me now?\u201d Gill confirmed that he is behind the posts on his X and Reddit accounts, and that the screenshots he has uploaded on the latter platform are of his own portfolio. \u201cThese are my positions. I\u2019m not working with anyone else. I\u2019m not working with hedge funds,\u201d he said. Gill had communicated exclusively by posting memes, gifs, short video clips and screenshots of his portfolio until the livestream, leaving it unclear if it even was Gill behind the social media posts. GameStop shares slid during his livestream and were halted several times for volatility. The livestream lasted roughly 50 minutes, much shorter than his previous livestreams that typically went on for several hours. \u201cWhat can I say about GameStop? I mean, the funny thing is that I have a lot of the same feelings about everything,\u201d said Gill. \u201cThey\u2019re in the transformation stage here. \u2026 I feel like I see enough. I believe (CEO Ryan Cohen) might be able to do it.\u201d In a surprise move, GameStop brought forward its first quarter earnings to Friday from next Tuesday. The video game retailer recorded a loss of $32.3 million, slightly better than the $50.5 million loss the prior year. First quarter sales slipped to $0.9 billion, from $1.2 billion the year before. Gill cautioned that while he has faith in Cohen, traders should reach their own conclusions. \u201cIt remains to be seen. You should keep your eye on stuff, too, reserve the right to change your mind just like I do. Don\u2019t follow anyone blindly,\u201d Gill said.

He shared another update on his portfolio, which showed he has not sold any of his 5 million shares or exercised his 120,000 call options after his last update on Thursday.

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent.

While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_08_business_renting-electric-vehicle-rental-cars", "text": "Lydia Wu had never driven an electric vehicle before she rented a car from Avis last February. An electric Genesis GV60 was all they had available at a location in Kansas City, Kansas. Wu received no specific instructions on how to use the vehicle, or how to find chargers, but she appreciated the SUV\u2019s ornate and elegant interior. \u201cIf it was a gas vehicle, I would totally consider it as my next car,\u201d she said. But she is out of the market for an EV. I, on the other hand, have had a lot of experience with EVs. So when I recently rented a Polestar 2 from Hertz in San Diego and received no instructions it was no problem. But I could imagine a first-time EV driver wondering, \u201cHow do I turn this thing on?\u201d Many would be flummoxed by a car with no \u201cStart\u201d button, for instance. In a Polestar, you get in and it\u2019s on. You get out and it turns off. A lot of drivers may be baffled by that alone. While sales growth has slowed, EVs make up about 7% of overall car sales, according to Cox Automotive. Rental car companies may have overestimated their customers\u2019 readiness for a switch, though. Hertz made a bold move in 2021, saying it would order 65,000 EVs from Polestar, 100,000 from Tesla and another 175,000 from General Motors. At the time, Hertz said that EVs might represent 25% of its fleet by 2024. But in January Hertz said it would sell 20,000 Tesla models, or one-third of its fleet, to buy gas-powered cars. The company\u2019s CEO at the time, Stephen Scherr, said, \u201cCollision and damage repairs on an EV can often run about twice that associated with a comparable combustion engine vehicle.\u201d Scant driver\u2019s ed In general, big rental car companies, with huge fleets to manage and lots of customers to put into cars, don\u2019t have time to give individual instruction to rookie EV drivers. And it\u2019s not a seamless transition from a gas-powered vehicle to an EV. Experienced as I am, I was still taken by surprise as I approached a stop light in the Polestar and the car slowed abruptly as soon as I lifted off the accelerator. Oh, right\u2026it\u2019s called \u201cautomatic regenerative braking.\u201d The Polestar was using its electric motor to slow the car while sending power back to the battery. That\u2019s a good thing, but, again, I could just imagine a new renter panicking and thinking, \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Hertz said in an email that it provides a QR code that links to a website with information about how to charge and even how to drive individual models like the Polestar 2. If that link was provided during my rental, then I must have missed it. I went to the website and watched the videos and, yes, the instructions would have been helpful. But, let\u2019s face it, how many people who rent cars take the time to read the paperwork, let alone go to a website to review instructions? Beyond that, both Hertz and Avis declined to comment for this story. Doug Jensen, similarly to Wu, found due to scarcity that he had to rent an EV from a Hertz location in New York City. Given no instruction on how to handle charging, he found himself trying to use Tesla chargers for his Kia rental car, not initially realizing they wouldn\u2019t work. Then he had to struggle with a non-working EV charger at his hotel. Since then, Hertz has respected Jensen\u2019s request to never have an EV again, he said. Hertz also gave him a free rental day and extra loyalty points to make up for his aggravation. Charging as a sticky point It was around around 1 a.m. in February in Kansas City, Kansas, when Wu got her rental GV60 with its batteries charged up to 57%. She had to quickly find a charger since it was cold and, with the heat running, the battery was draining faster than normal. \u201cIt was easy to find chargers but the thing is (the navigation software was) pulling up every single charger available including Tesla Superchargers,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have EV experience so I had no idea if Tesla Superchargers were going to work with my car.\u201d Wu was ultimately able to find a charger. She said her experience with the EV was good after it had been plugged in. \u201cI could monitor how my car was doing, charge-wise, from my phone, even though it was in the parking lot a few blocks away. So everything was super great,\u201d she said. There are car rental companies that offer customers more hand-holding. In my case, I\u2019ve rented EVs from Turo, a peer-to-peer car rental platform that\u2019s sort of like Airbnb but for cars. Just like with Airbnb, some people have set up small businesses renting their vehicles through Turo and some of them specialize in EVs. When I\u2019ve rented EVs through Turo, a host has always given me a helpful walk-through of the vehicle. The hosts would explain the features, something that was especially helpful when I rented a Tesla Cybertruck, an EV that has plenty of quirks. The Cybertruck had cost more than a $1,000 a day to rent at the time including insurance \u2014 it had just come out \u2014 but EV rental costs are normally more in line with gas cars. Customer service as key Joulez, an EV rental company, rents its fleet through its own website as well as through Turo. Founder Micah Bergdale said he had rented EVs years ago and saw an opportunity to do it better so he started the company in 2021. \u201cThe entire experience that someone has, especially if they\u2019re not familiar with it, is very different than a traditional gas car,\u201d he said. On the Joulez website, customers are asked if they have ever driven an EV and if they have any experience with the specific model they\u2019re about to rent. If not, an on-site attendant can provide an overview. Also, Joulez has a customer service line if they have issues with things like charging. Of course, a company like Joulez can provide that kind of attention because it only has locations in four US cities and its fleet consists of about 150 vehicles. Bigger rental companies, on the other hand, manage hundreds of thousands of cars in locations nationwide. And, of course, Joulez and Turo have the advantage of a customer base that knows up front what they\u2019re renting. Their customers select specific vehicles, unlike customers who rent from big rental companies where they might select a general class of vehicle but not find out the make and model until they arrive at the lot. But not everyone has such a bad time when renting an EV from a big rental car company. Jay Waldron, a Georgia resident, rented a Hyundai Kona EV from National while on a trip to Washington, DC. He loved how fun it was to drive. \u201cIt was so disappointing going back to my old stick-shift 4 cylinder,\u201d he said in a text message. \u201cSitting in traffic with it, I missed that EV bad.\u201d A few weeks later, Waldron bought himself a Kia EV6.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/08/business/renting-electric-vehicle-rental-cars/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
