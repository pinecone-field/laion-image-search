{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}

Thursday\u2019s order by the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas sets the date for a high-profile showdown over Media Matters\u2019 research highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on the social media platform. In November, X\u00a0sued Media Matters, alleging that the group went out of its way to misrepresent the likelihood that users may encounter hate speech on the platform. CNN has reached out to X for comment on Thursday\u2019s order. Media Matters declined to comment. Media Matters President Angelo Carusone\u00a0has previously called X\u2019s suit \u201cfrivolous\u201d and an attempt to silence Musk\u2019s critics. The lawsuit claimed that Media Matters\u2019 testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the group\u2019s reports distorted the odds of a person seeing extremist material. Motions for summary judgment in the case are due in December, and a decision by the judge on those filings could decide the case prior to trial. Musk has suffered setbacks in similar cases. In March, a federal judge in California reprimanded X and tossed out a lawsuit it had filed against another watchdog group, the Center for Countering Digital Hate.

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Meme stock mania is back. This time around, it\u2019s looking a little different. Meme stocks saw a resurgence last month after Keith Gill, an investor who helped stoke the meme stock frenzy in 2021, made his first post on X in three years. Also known as \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d Gill has since posted screenshots on Reddit that appear to show GameStop shares and call options worth hundreds of millions of dollars in his portfolio, stoking excitement among his devout followers. (CNN has not independently confirmed the screenshots.) GameStop shares have surged roughly 75% and seen wild, unpredictable swings since that first post. Gill\u2019s fans last Friday flocked to his livestream, inundating the live chat with comments and questions. A video montage of kittens played before Gill himself finally appeared.\u00a0The meme trader poured a beer during the stream and sported gaudy white sunglasses. For many traders who experienced the original meme stock craze, the phenomenon has prompted a wave of deja vu. Still, there are key differences between the reignited 2024 meme stock craze and the original in 2021. For one, trading volumes aren\u2019t nearly as high as they were three years ago. Daily trading volumes of GameStop shares peaked at roughly 789 million on January 22, 2021, when the stock popped 51%, according to FactSet data. The highest trading volume for GameStop so far this year was on June 7, when roughly 279 million shares traded hands \u2014 and the stock tumbled 39%. The difference in volumes could be due to the drastic changes in the economy, on Wall Street and in the world during the last few years. In 2021, people were stuck at home due to the Covid pandemic, using their stimulus checks to buy everything from exercise equipment to ingredients for baking bread to stocks. Interest rates were near zero, and the US economy was booming. Now, interest rates are at a 23-year high. Persistent inflation is eating into Americans\u2019 savings accounts. The economy remains resilient, but is showing signs of cooling as the Federal Reserve tries to bring down prices without triggering a recession. That has traders less willing to take on less investment risk compared to three years ago. One thing that\u2019s stayed the same? GameStop, along with other meme stocks, is still lacking when it comes to its balance sheet, says Craig Sarembock, a wealth advisor at Bartlett Wealth Management. While GameStop shares have surged in recent weeks, it is still down 65% from its record high closing price in 2021. The video game retailer reported last Friday a loss of $32.3 million during the first quarter, slightly better than the $50.5 million loss the prior year. Sales slipped to $900 million from $1.2 billion the year before. \u201cCan you trade [meme stocks] and make money? Absolutely. You can do that with any stock. But for long term investors, that is just an area I would avoid wholeheartedly,\u201d said Sarembock. Why oil companies are raking in record profits under Joe Biden Nearly four years ago, while campaigning in the runup to the last presidential election, Donald Trump warned that President Joe Biden would \u201cdestroy\u201d the oil industry. As Trump and Biden are set once again to face off in a presidential election, Trump has renewed claims that Biden\u2019s agenda has hurt energy producers, promising to hit rewind on Biden\u2019s environmental policies. But the oil and gas industry in the United States has thrived under the current president, even as the Biden administration has touted its efforts to transition away from fossil fuels and towards green energy sources, reports my colleague Samantha Delouya. In the last three and a half years, US oil production \u2014 and oil and gas company profits \u2014 have broken records. The top five US-based oil and gas companies by market cap, according to S&P Global \u2014 ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources and Schlumberger \u2014 have raked in more than $250 billion in profits between 2021 and 2023. That\u2019s a 160% jump compared to the first three years of the pro-big-oil Trump administration, according to calculations by CNN. The energy industry\u2019s recent profit windfall underscores the limited influence of any US president \u2014 whether in favor of fossil fuel or not \u2014 in the global oil and gas market.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}

In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}

That doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t face challenges. The World Bank on Tuesday raised its 2024 outlook for global economic growth to hold steady at 2.6%, an increase from its previous projection of 2.4% growth. But the group warned that growth won\u2019t be felt evenly or match the clip seen before the Covid pandemic. \u201cFour years after the upheavals caused by the pandemic, conflicts, inflation, and monetary tightening, it appears that global economic growth is steadying,\u201d Indermit Gill, the World Bank\u2019s chief economist, said in a release accompanying the report. \u201cHowever, growth is at lower levels than before 2020. Prospects for the world\u2019s poorest economies are even more worrisome.\u201d Here are three risks the World Bank sees. High interest rates. The group expects global inflation to slow to 3.5% this year and 2.9% in 2025 but fall at a more sluggish pace than it expected six months ago. World interest rates will likely average 4% over 2025 and 2026, roughly double the average of the two decades preceding the pandemic, according to the World Bank. The European Central Bank and Bank of Canada have already cut their key interest rates in recent weeks. The US Federal Reserve has yet to follow, holding rates steady for a seventh consecutive time on Wednesday. The Fed also trimmed its projections for rate cuts this year from three to one. Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the progress made on tamping down prices but said that the central bank needs to see inflation closer to its 2% target before easing monetary policy. \u201cAn environment of \u2018higher-for-longer\u2019 rates would mean tighter global financial conditions and much weaker growth in developing economies,\u201d said Ayhan Kose, the World Bank\u2019s deputy chief economist, in a release. Geopolitical tensions. The World Bank said that spillover risk from the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel-Hamas war could curb global growth by pushing up oil prices and shipping costs. Oil prices have come down since initial spikes from both wars, with the price of international crude futures settling at $82.60 a barrel on Wednesday. Attacks on container vessels in the Red Sea on one of the world\u2019s most important trade routes have driven up costs and led to shipping delays. \u201cEscalating conflict could also dent global business and consumer sentiment, and increase risk aversion, weighing on demand and growth,\u201d the report said. Politics. Risks also stem from several possible changes to government leadership this year. Key elections have occurred or are set to take place in India, Mexico, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, among dozens of other countries. Trade tensions are already brewing between some of the world\u2019s biggest global economic engines. China said last month that it staunchly opposes new US tariffs on $18 billion worth of imports of Chinese electric vehicles and other products, warning that the trade barriers would affect the wider relationship between the two economic superpowers. Then, the European Commission on Wednesday said that the EU is hiking tariffs on EVs imported from China, drawing blowback from Beijing. \u201cHeightened trade policy-related uncertainty and the potential for more inward-looking policies could weigh on trade prospects and economic activity,\u201d the World Bank report said. Even with food prices flattening out, the cost of dining out is still going up Grocery prices stayed flat in May, after ticking down the month before. But menu prices, a source of frustration for budget-conscious consumers, are still going up \u2014 even as restaurants brag about their discounted meals, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner. Menu prices rose 0.4% at sit-down restaurants from April to May, adjusted for seasonal swings, according to inflation data released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In that time prices ticked up 0.2% at limited service spots, which include fast casual and fast food joints. The difference between grocery increases and menu price inflation was more pronounced for the full year. Grocery prices rose 1% in the 12 months through May. In that period, menu prices at full-service, or sit-down, restaurants rose 3.5%. They jumped 4.5% at limited-service restaurants, which include fast food and fast casual joints. The increases, particularly in fast food prices, have caused customers to pull back on spending and complain online, eroding the sector\u2019s reputation for affordability. Restaurant chains raise menu prices every year, but since the pandemic hikes have been coming in fast and furious. Executives noted that for a while, the higher prices didn\u2019t scare people off. But customers finally snapped, leaving chains to reverse course and sometimes get defensive. McDonald\u2019s USA president Joe Erlinger recently said in an open letter that prices have risen about 21% over five years. That\u2019s a bit less than inflation overall \u2014 not 100% as, he said, people may think, thanks to an analysis from FinanceBuzz. It recently found that McDonald\u2019s prices have risen 100% since 2014. Still, he acknowledged that at some locations, Big Mac meals may be going for much higher. On TikTok, complaints of $3 McDonald\u2019s hash browns and $16 meals have gone viral. Read more here. Politicians keep courting the TikTok vote. Users aren\u2019t impressed TikTok may not be as hot a place for politics as many seem to think. The attention devoted to TikTok as a powerful force in US politics \u2014 for better or for worse \u2014 does not seem to match up with the experience of most TikTok users, according to new survey data released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. As the short-form video app has surged to 170 million US users, politicians have flocked to TikTok in hopes of wooing young voters. Former President Donald Trump joined TikTok last week, amassing 6 million followers in a matter of days. President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign launched on TikTok in February and has posted more than 200 videos \u2014 though the campaign\u2019s following is just a fraction of Trump\u2019s at 373,000. Other politicians, meanwhile, warn that TikTok\u2019s links to China through its parent company mean the Chinese government could theoretically try to influence US politics on a massive scale, if it ever accessed the personal data of TikTok users. (TikTok denies it has ever given the Chinese government US user data and is suing to block a law Biden signed this spring that could ban the app from the United States.) But the picture painted by Pew\u2019s latest surveys suggests politics is still just a small part of what the platform has to offer.

{"id": "2024_06_13_business_faa-boeing-oversight-too-hands-off", "text": "Federal Aviation Administration chief Mike Whitaker said his agency is partly responsible for the safety problems at Boeing, admitting that it had been \u201ctoo hands off\u201d in its oversight of the troubled aircraft manufacturer. In testimony Thursday before the Senate Commerce Committee, Whitaker said that his agency now had far more inspectors on the ground at Boeing factories and the factory of its primary supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. He said it will continue to push Boeing to improve its safety culture in the wake of the January 5 incident in which a door plug blew off during an Alaksa Airlines flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the Boeing 737 Max. But he also said that the FAA was not blameless in that incident. \u201cLet me also acknowledge the FAA should have had much better visibility into what was happening at Boeing before January 5,\u201d he said in his opening remarks to the committee. \u201cThe FAA\u2019s approach was too hands off, too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections. We have changed that approach over the last several months. And those changes are permanent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have now moved to a more active, comprehensive oversight model - the audit plus inspection approach.\u201d Whitaker, who was confirmed to his job heading the nation\u2019s primary aviation regulator in October, said he will be visiting Boeing\u2019s South Carolina factory himself tomorrow, and its plant that makes the 737 Max in Renton, Washington in September. Whitaker said that the FAA previously had 24 inspectors at Boeing and Spirit and that the number was in the low 30s now. Its target is 55 inspectors, although he did not give a date for when that would be in place. And he said that number could change over time. \u201cWe can no longer afford to remain reactive,\u201d he said. A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board has found that bolts necessary to keep the door plug on the Alaska Air plane in place were missing from the plane at the time it left the Boeing factory in Washington roughly two months before the flight. Under questions at Thursday\u2019s hearing, Whitaker said the FAA did not have any inspectors in the factories at that time when the piece was put in. Instead the FAA staff was focused on paperwork audits instead of actual inspections. \u201cWe clearly did not have enough folks to see what was going on in that factory,\u201d he said. Safety experience\u2026 in the dairy industry But finding the inspectors could be a problem. Sen. Maria Cantwell, the Washington Democrat who is chair of the committee, questioned the backgrounds of some of the safety inspectors. \u201cI\u2019m definitely hearing \u2018We don\u2019t have enough aviation inspectors.\u2019 And \u2018We don\u2019t even have enough qualified instructors at schools,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cOne story I heard was that they said, \u2018Yes, I have safety experience. But it\u2019s in the dairy industry.\u2019 We need an aviation inspector on the floor who has aviation experience, not just safety experience.\u201d Whitaker responded that while the agency is having to provide some training for new hires, it is finding the experienced inspectors it needs for Boeing. \u201cWith respect to Boeing, we\u2019re putting our most experienced and best people on this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly the most important issue we\u2019re dealing with right now.\u201d But for years the FAA has relied on employees of Boeing and other manufacturers to inspect their own companies, then report to the FAA, under what is known as \u201cdelegation of authority.\u201d That structure is still in place, even with more FAA employees now on the floor at Boeing factories. That reliance on self-inspection and self-certification first started getting attention in 2019 after two fatal crashes of the 737 Max that killed 346 people and led to a 20-month grounding of the plane. The fact that much of the certification of the Max, a relatively new aircraft, was done by Boeing employees, not FAA staff, raised questions in Congress and an outcry among families of some of the crash victims. In January, after the Alaska Air flight, Whitaker joined those who suggested the process needed to be changed. \u201cIt is time to re-examine the delegation of authority and assess any associated safety risks,\u201d said Whitaker a week after the incident. \u201cThe grounding of the 737-9 and the multiple production-related issues identified in recent years require us to look at every option to reduce risk.\u201d In February the FAA gave Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to improve safety. And in late May when the plan was submitted, the FAA announced it was leaving a limit on production levels in place until safety improves. \u201cThere must be a fundamental shift in the company\u2019s safety culture in order to holistically address its quality and safety challenges,\u201d Whitaker said on Thursday. \u201cThis is about systemic change, and there\u2019s a lot of work to be done.\u201d But he said there has been a shift in tone in discussions between the FAA and Boeing executives since the January incident. \u201cMy focus has been on making it clear this is a very long-term journey. You don\u2019t change the culture of an organization. We\u2019ve seen an increasing recognition that this is a long journey ahead.\u201d Boeing also said it has made significant changes since January. \u201cWe listened to our employees, engaged transparently with our regulator, welcomed the findings and recommendations from the FAA \u2026. and invited scrutiny from customers and independent experts,\u201d it said in a statement when asked for a comment on Thursday\u2019s hearing. \u201cWe will work under the FAA\u2019s oversight and uphold our responsibility to the flying public to continue delivering safe, high-quality airplanes.\u201d  This story has been updated with additional reporting and context.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/business/faa-boeing-oversight-too-hands-off/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_economy_may-survey-consumer-expectations", "text": "Presidential election polls may be showing that some Americans have mixed, if not outright sour, views on the overall economy \u2014 but when it comes to how they view their own finances, things are looking pretty good. US consumers are more optimistic about their current and future financial situation, the stock market and slowing inflation, according to survey data released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The New York Fed\u2019s May Survey of Consumer Expectations showed improvement of people\u2019s perceptions of their current financial situation as well as their outlook for a year from now. The share of respondents who said their financial situation was better than in May 2023 was at its second-highest level in more than two years, while the year-ahead positive share landed at its highest level in nearly three years. Monday\u2019s survey also showed improved optimism beyond the homefront: Notably, consumers believe the markets\u2019 good times could keep rolling. Households\u2019 expectations for highest US stock prices improved to a three-year high. In terms of the labor market, the latest survey was a little mixed. Earnings growth expectations dipped slightly, while the expected probability of the national unemployment rate being higher next year increased above the 12-month trailing average. At the same time, consumers\u2019 perceived probability that they\u2019d lose their job decreased below the 12-month trailing average. The May Survey of Consumer Expectations showed a rosier picture than the New York Fed\u2019s survey a month before, which showed respondents bracing for even more expensive homes \u2014 anticipated home price growth hit a nearly two-year high \u2014 while year-ahead inflation expectations picked up to the highest level in five months. In May, home price expectations were still high, unchanged from the month before; however, inflation expectations dipped \u2014 and that\u2019s a good sign for the Federal Reserve. The Fed closely monitors gauges of near-, medium- and long-term inflation expectations as those could be self-fulfilling prophecies for consumers: If people think prices will be higher in the future, they might spend more now or even demand higher wages. In turn, businesses faced with higher costs might end up raising prices as a result. Monday\u2019s survey showed that the three- and five-year inflation expectations were unchanged. The US will get a critical read on the state of inflation this week with the release of the May Consumer Price Index on Wednesday morning. The most widely used inflation gauge is expected to show that consumer prices slowed on a monthly basis and that a key underlying inflation metric has also cooled. If the expectations hold true, that would be welcome news for Americans weighed down by three-plus years of elevated inflation, the Fed in its fight to rein in price hikes, and the markets. When the April CPI showed inflation on a cooler trajectory than it had started the year, the major US stock indexes all surged to record highs.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/economy/may-survey-consumer-expectations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}

With clients working with a single channel of communication that directs\u00a0Samsung\u2019s memory chip, foundry and chip packaging teams at once, the time it takes to produce AI chips, usually weeks, has been cut by around 20%,\u00a0Samsung\u00a0said on Wednesday. \u201cWe are truly living in the age of AI, the emergence of generative AI is completely changing the technology landscape,\u201d said Siyoung Choi, president and general manager of the foundry business, at a\u00a0Samsung\u00a0event in San Jose, California. Samsung\u00a0expects global chip industry revenue to grow to $778 billion by 2028, boosted by AI chips, Choi said. At a briefing with reporters ahead of the event, Executive Vice President of Foundry Sales and Marketing Marco Chisari said the company believes OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u2019s loose projections on soaring demand for AI chips are realistic. Altman has told executives at contract chipmaker TSMC that\u00a0he wanted to build roughly three dozen new chip factories, Reuters\u00a0has previously reported. Samsung\u00a0is one of the few companies that sells memory chips, offers foundry services and designs chips under the same roof. That combination has often worked against it in the past, as some clients were nervous that doing business with its foundry might benefit\u00a0Samsung\u00a0as a competitor in another field. However, with skyrocketing demand for AI chips and the need for all the chip parts to be highly integrated to train or infer huge amounts of data fast by using less power,\u00a0Samsung\u00a0believes its turnkey approach will be a strength going forward. The South Korean tech giant also touted its cutting-edge chip architecture known as gate all-around (GAA), a type of transistor architecture that helps improve chip performance and reduces power consumption. GAA is seen as important to keep making more powerful chips for AI as chips become finer to the point of pushing the boundaries of physics. Although competitors such as global foundry No 1 TSMC are also working on chips using GAA,\u00a0Samsung\u00a0started applying GAA earlier, and said it plans to mass produce its second-generation 3-nanometer chips using GAA in the second half of this year. Samsung\u00a0also announced its latest 2-nanometer chipmaking process for high-performance computing chips, which places power rails on the backside of the wafer to improve power delivery.

{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_investing_premarket-stocks-trading-fed-meeting-rates", "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business\u2019 Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Another month, another hot jobs report that has Wall Street wondering when the Federal Reserve will finally cut interest rates. The US economy added 272,000 jobs in May, racing past economists\u2019 predictions for 180,000. The jobless rate rose only slightly to 4%\ufeff. The hot jobs report is a double-edged sword for Wall Street. On one hand, a resilient labor market lessens the chance that the economy will tip into recession. On the other, it puts long-awaited interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve on the back burner. Traders are betting that the Fed will ease rates once or twice this year, but not before September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The Fed is expected to hold rates steady at its policy meeting this week, as inflation remains above its 2% target and the economy is slow to cool. Investors are awaiting the latest Summary of Economic Projections, which contains the \u201cdot plot,\u201d or a chart where Fed officials project where rates could head in the future. Before the Bell spoke with Nate Thooft, chief investment officer of multi-asset solutions at Manulife Investment Management, about when he expects the Federal Reserve to begin cutting rates and what that means for markets. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Before the Bell: Do you think the Fed could lower its projection for three quarter-point rate cuts this year? There\u2019s no doubt that they could. The Fed\u2019s dot plot is still basically saying three, so there\u2019s a reasonable chance the dot plot does adjust to two as the possible outcome. But we\u2019re in the camp that it\u2019s two or three quarter-point [cuts]. I\u2019m not sure it really matters that much in the grand scheme of things, because the big point will be we are going to begin a cutting cycle the way other major global central banks are, whether it\u2019s the [European Central Bank] or Bank of Canada. The US will very likely join them, at least starting the cutting cycle before the end of this year with one to three cuts \u2014 our argument is two or three \u2014 and then they\u2019ll continue to do so through the course of 2025. Is it concerning that the European Central Bank and Bank of Canada have begun cutting rates before the Fed? The big thing that we have a lot of anxiety about is currency. (BTB: Higher interest rates tend to strengthen a currency.) The other central banks can move several quarter-points before the Fed, but they can\u2019t go into a completely accommodative state while the Fed is still in a very restrictive state. While the Fed and other central banks generally don\u2019t have currency as part of their explicit mandate, they are not void of being aware of those dynamics. So, I do think generally speaking, we believe the dollar is probably close to or right around its kind of peak levels. But there is a risk that if the Fed has to delay longer and other central banks continue to move forward, it\u2019s going to become more problematic for risk assets in general, especially outside the US if the dollar strength continues, like we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years. So that\u2019s something that we are watching very closely. Do you think questions about whether the Fed will cut rates later this year could add to stock market volatility as we draw closer to election day? You could see some additional volatility in the US around the election. But ultimately, and our view has always been this case, the US electorate is very split and very equally split. And so you\u2019re not going to be likely in a position where either party has significant majorities across the three components of government \u2026 which means significant policy changes are not that likely over the coming four years. And overall, that\u2019s been a positive for the US for much of its history when it comes to elections not really directly impacting markets much other than some short-term volatility around the election cycle. Workers at Samsung Electronics walk out for the first time ever A labor union at Samsung Electronics in South Korea said many workers went on strike Friday, marking the first such walkout in the smartphone and chipmaking giant\u2019s 55-year history, report my colleagues Yoonjung Seo and Diksha Madhok. The Nationwide Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU) said last week that its 28,000 members \u2014 just under a quarter of the company\u2019s total workforce in the country \u2014 would stage a one-day strike on June 7, following failed negotiations over pay and bonus arrangements. The union asked its members to take a day off on Friday, which falls between a public holiday on Thursday and the weekend. Son Woomok, a union leader, told CNN that \u201cmany employees used their annual leave today,\u201d and at one site \u201call workers had taken leave so replacement personnel were deployed.\u201d He did not provide other details. He had previously said many NSEU members work for Samsung\u2019s flagship semiconductor unit. That division is trying to regain its former status as a top semiconductor company, according to Reuters, which says Samsung has fallen behind its competitors SK Hynix and Micron Technology in delivering chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) processors. A Samsung spokesperson told CNN that, \u201cthere is no impact on production and management activities\u201d as a result of the one-day walkout. Read more here. How a Depression-era law could be used to make your booze cheaper Federal regulators are planning to use a rarely enforced law from the Great Depression to allege America\u2019s largest alcohol distributor is unfairly pricing wine and spirits, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. A looming Federal Trade Commission lawsuit against Southern Glazer\u2019s Wine and Spirits would be aimed at lowering costs for consumers \u2014 in this case on alcohol \u2014 and ensuring mom-and-pop shops have a level playing field against big chains, the source said. The case, which could be risky, would represent the latest effort by Biden administration regulators to show they are taking action to lower costs and confront dominant companies, reports my colleague Matt Egan.  It would also be the latest aggressive step by FTC Chair Lina Khan, who recently led the agency to ban most employers from using noncompete clauses and is probing a Microsoft deal with an artificial intelligence startup. The latest battleground in the antitrust fight could be booze. Southern Glazer\u2019s, based in Miami and operating in 44 US states, is the largest wine and spirits distributor in the United States. The family-owned company distributes everything from Grey Goose vodka and Jim Beam bourbon to Yellow Tail wine. The FTC lawsuit, previously reported by Politico, could come in the next few weeks and would rely on the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, the source said. That Depression-era law prohibits suppliers from providing deeper discounts to large chains than to smaller stores.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security", "text": "The Federal Trade Commission is investigating TikTok for its data and security practices, two sources told CNN on the condition of anonymity. The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data.

{"id": "2024_06_10_business_southwest-activist-investor-stake", "text": "Elliott Investment Management announced Monday it has taken a $1.9 billion stake in Southwest Airlines and said there needs to be new leadership at the Dallas-based carrier. \u201cSouthwest\u2019s poor execution and leadership\u2019s stubborn unwillingness to evolve the company\u2019s strategy have led to deeply disappointing results for shareholders, employees and customers alike,\u201d said the statement from the firm. \u201cSouthwest\u2019s rigid commitment to a decades-old approach has inhibited its ability to compete in the modern airline industry.\u201d The letter pointed out that Southwest\u2019s share price is down more than 50% from early 2021 and now trades at a price lower than its pre-pandemic price in 2020.  Southwest (LUV) stock gained more than 6% in trading Monday on the news of Elliott\u2019s letter to the Southwest Board. The airline has been particularly hurt by the fact that it only flies the Boeing 737 jet, and that the promised deliveries of the jets in at least the next year will be delayed by safety and production problems. It has been forced to freeze hiring of pilots as it will take delivery of only 20 of the 79 promised jets. Ellioitt\u2019s letter made no mention of a desire to change Southwest from an all-737 fleet, which would increase the cost of pilot training and spare parts. While Boeing has caused problems for Southwest, some have been self-inflicted. The carrier suffered massive operational problems during the year-end holiday travel period in 2022, causing it to cancel 16,700 flights between December 21 and 29 that year, or nearly half of its schedule. The meltdown was attributed to antiquated staff scheduling software that made it difficult to recover from bad weather at the start of the period. The disruptions cost it more than $1 billion in passenger compensation, increased pay for staff and lost ticketing revenue, in addition to a $140 million fine by the Department of Transportation. Its letter does not give details about the changes it wants to see, other than a change in leadership at the airline. It did say the management company wants to see \u201cincreased customer choice, improved cost execution and updating outdated IT systems, among other opportunities.\u201d Southwest said it was only contacted by Elliott on Sunday. It said it looks \u201cforward to better understanding their views on our company.\u201d \u201cThe Southwest board of directors is confident in our CEO and management\u2019s ability to execute against the company\u2019s strategic plan to drive long-term value for all shareholders, safely and reliably serve our customers and deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders,\u201d it added. Florida-based Elliott, whose web site said it managed about $65.5 billion in assets at the end of last year, was founded in 1977. It recently disclosed a similar $2.5 billion position in Texas Instruments and has reportedly made invests in Softbank and Johnson Controls recently. Southwest is the one airline that does not have seat reservation for its passengers. CEO Bob Jordan told investors last month that the airline is \u201cseriously studying\u201d a possible change to that policy.

The two professional competitive eaters will face off in a Netflix special titled \u201cCHESTNUT VS. KOBAYASHI: UNFINISHED BEEF,\u201d which the streaming company advertised as a determination of the ultimate hot dog eating champion. Netflix\u2019s announcement comes just a day after Chestnut was banned from competing in Nathan\u2019s hot dog eating contest because he signed\u00a0a deal with rival plant-based food company Impossible Foods. Chestnut is a hot dog champ. He\u2019s won the \u201cMustard Yellow Belt\u201d 16 times, ate a world record 76 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes in 2021 and has reportedly made hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars for his competitive eating of hot dogs and other foods. Kobayashi is Chestnut\u2019s \u201cfiercest rival,\u201d he said in a Netflix press release. Kobayashi \u2014 who popularized competitive eating as a sport in 2001 when he almost doubled the previous record for most hot dogs eaten in the Nathan\u2019s Hot Dog Eating Championship \u2014 said he would put off retiring until he takes down Chestnut \u201cone last time\u201d in the release. Netflix said the last time the two faced off was in 2009, when Chestnut edged past Kobayashi. Similar to Chestnut, Kobayashi was banned from competing in the Nathan\u2019s Competition due to a contract dispute in 2010. \u201cWe are devastated to learn that Joey Chestnut has chosen to represent a rival brand that sells plant-based hot dogs rather than competing in the 2024 Nathan\u2019s Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest,\u201d the Major League Eating organization, which oversees the Nathan\u2019s event, said in a statement Tuesday.

{"id": "2024_06_13_economy_biden-nominates-new-fdic-head", "text": "President Joe Biden has nominated Christy Goldsmith Romero as chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The announcement comes after current FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg said he intended to resign once a successor is confirmed by the Senate following a scathing independent investigation detailing pervasive sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying at the agency charged with regulating the banking sector. Goldsmith Romero, a Democrat, served as special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program at the Treasury Department that was borne out of the Great Recession. In that role, she was responsible for overseeing efforts to crack down on banks\u2019 misuse of funds they received from the program. In a statement released Thursday, the White House said Goldsmith Romero \u201chas more than 20 years of experience as a career federal attorney and leader in financial regulation, serving under four Presidents\u201d and touted her experience promoting \u201cfinancial stability and market resiliency, integrity, and vibrancy.\u201d An agency under scrutiny She also has the advantage of having been unanimously confirmed by the Senate twice for previous positions, which may improve her odds of getting confirmed a third time. That contributed to why Biden chose to nominate her, a person familiar with the matter told C\ufeffNN. Republican and Democratic senators were briefed on Biden\u2019s intent to nominate her prior to Thursday\u2019s announcement, they added. As incoming head of the FDIC, she will largely be viewed as the figure responsible for fixing the longstanding problematic culture at the agency. Goldsmith Romero was picked instead of promoting someone internally at the FDIC because there was a general sense that it would take someone perceived as having a clean slate to usher in lasting change, the person said. An independent investigation commissioned by the FDIC released in early May confirmed the Wall Street Journal\u2019s reporting from last year. Among the findings were many women receiving sexually explicit messages as well as unwanted advances from male coworkers who were often in more senior roles. Minorities and women reported being passed over for promotions. A Hispanic employee said they were \u201casked by a colleague to recite the Pledge of Allegiance to prove that they were American.\u201d Many FDIC employees who partook in the investigation expressed a fear of retaliation for speaking out against alleged misconduct in addition to a lack of disciplinary actions taken against wrongdoers. Gruenberg\u2019s exit Under pressure from the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Gruenberg announced he would vacate the position once a new chair is confirmed. The move drew sharp rebuke from Republicans, who viewed it as politically motivated because if Gruenberg resigned immediately then Vice Chair Travis Hill, a Republican appointee, would have automatically become chair. That would have left the agency deadlocked with one other Republican and two Democrat members on the FDIC\u2019s board of directors, which would likely prevent controversial banking regulations, such as ramped-up capital requirements, from taking effect.

{"id": "2024_06_13_media_tucker-carlson-ticketmaster-tour", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Ticketmaster\u00a0is linking arms with right-wing extremists, boosting their ability to reach mainstream audiences and profiting off their dangerous and hateful rhetoric ahead of the November election. The ticketing sales giant is the distributor of the forthcoming live speaking tour from\u00a0Tucker Carlson,\u00a0who announced plans this week to crisscross the country with a 15-city arena tour, inviting fellow conspiracy theorists such as\u00a0Alex Jones\u00a0and\u00a0Marjorie Taylor Greene\u00a0to join him along the way. On the Ticketmaster website, Carlson is referred to as \u201cthe leading voice in American politics\u201d and \u201can alternative to corporate media dedicated to telling the truth about the things that matter \u2014 clearly and without fear.\u201d While it is hard to imagine that Ticketmaster conjured this glowing description of Carlson itself, it is remarkable the company would approve it and promote it on its site. That is because there is not a morsel of truth to how Ticketmaster is presenting Carlson to its customers. Carlson, a former mainstream conservative who over the course of\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0presidency traveled to the fringes of American politics, has for years promoted dangerous disinformation and damaging conspiracy theories. Carlson lied about the Covid-19 vaccines, discouraging his fans from receiving the life-saving shots. He sowed doubt about the legitimacy of the 2020 election, suggesting that it was rigged by sinister forces against Trump. And he reprehensibly peddled the false notion that the January 6 insurrection was a so-called \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation staged by the \u201cdeep state.\u201d In addition to those corrosive lies, Carlson has been one of the top promoters of the\u00a0Great Replacement Theory, the idea favored by White supremacists that falsely accuses the\u00a0Democratic Party\u00a0and wealthy Jewish figures, such as\u00a0George Soros, of importing third-world migrants into the U.S. to shift the country\u2019s demographics to win elections. For his repugnant promotion of such lies,\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0noted that\u00a0while Carlson was at Fox News, he \u201cconstructed what may be the most racist show in the history of cable news.\u201d Ultimately, Carlson grew to be too much of a problem even for\u00a0Fox News, and the\u00a0Rupert Murdoch-controlled right-wing channel dispensed of him last year. Evidently, Fox News has higher standards for whom they will do business with than Ticketmaster, a remarkably low bar for the events giant to trip over. Asked for comment this week, representatives for the Live Nation subsidiary chose not to respond. In fairness to the company\u2019s public relations division, it is difficult to see how they can defend such conduct. How can any decent person not only participate in enabling Carlson\u2019s poisoning of the public discourse but also justify profiting off of his hateful rhetoric in the process? CNN also posed questions to the venues hosting Carlson, which include the\u00a0Honda Center,\u00a0T-Mobile Center,\u00a0Delta Center,\u00a0Dickies Arena,\u00a0Intrust Bank Arena and others. Spokespeople representing each respective venue did not provide a comment. These are uneasy questions that major businesses will be confronted with in the years ahead as the\u00a0Republican Party\u00a0veers further and further toward the fringe. Far-right and conspiratorial figures like Jones, the founder of\u00a0Infowars\u00a0who openly fantasized this week about executing\u00a0Dr. Anthony Fauci\u00a0and other Trump critics, were once banished to the shadows of the conservative movement, mocked by people like Carlson. Now, Carlson and others openly celebrate Jones, fully aligning themselves to assail the nation\u2019s institutions. Companies with basic ethics should, of course, reject doing business with dishonest figures who profit by dumping toxic waste into the country\u2019s information environment. But doing so puts them at risk of being targeted by those very same people who, like Trump, have tremendous sway over the vast majority of Republicans and a lightning rod for painful boycotts. But, while the politics of 2024 makes for a thorny business environment for companies to navigate, from an ethics perspective, the questions that lie before them come with clear and obvious answers. Those uncomfortable decisions risk catapulting them squarely into the center of the information wars, where grifters like Carlson thrive.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/media/tucker-carlson-ticketmaster-tour/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_tech_spacex-elon-musk-former-employees-lawsuit", "text": "SpaceX and CEO Elon Musk were sued on Wednesday by former employees who claim they were illegally fired for raising concerns about gender discrimination and sexual harassment at the rocket company. The lawsuit, brought by eight employees who were fired in 2022, alleges that Musk wants to be \u201cthe leader to a brave new world of space travel, but runs his company in the dark ages \u2014 treating women as sexual objects to be evaluated on their bra size, bombarding the workplace with lewd sexual banter, and offering the reprise to those who challenge the \u2018Animal House\u2019 environment that if they don\u2019t like it they can seek employment elsewhere,\u201d according to the complaint, filed in state court in California. The eight former employees were involved in writing a 2022 open letter criticizing Musk and urging SpaceX executives to make the firm\u2019s culture more inclusive. The letter, which was signed by at least 400 other employees, asked SpaceX management to make it clear that Musk\u2019s statements \u2014 particularly on Twitter \u2014 did not reflect the views or values of the company and asserted that SpaceX\u2019s so-called \u201cNo A**hole\u201d policy was unevenly enforced. Following the letter\u2019s release, the eight employees were fired. Wednesday\u2019s complaint alleges that \u201cMusk personally ordered the Plaintiff\u2019s terminations.\u201d SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. SpaceX does not typically respond to queries from news organizations. In response to the 2022 letter, SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell previously said she would enforce SpaceX\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d standards against employee harassment, but the The New York Times reported that she said the employees had been fired for making other staff feel \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d SpaceX previously faced similar complaints filed to the National Labor Relations Board over the termination of employees involved in the letter. Those complaints claimed that the terminations amounted to employees being fired for engaging in \u201cconcerted protected activities.\u201d One former employee who filed an NLRB complaint and is a plaintiff in the Wednesday lawsuit, Tom Moline, previously told CNN that SpaceX management used an \u201c\u2018ends justifies the means\u2019 philosophy to turn a blind eye to the ongoing mistreatment, harassment, and abuse reported by my colleagues, much of which was directly encouraged and inspired by the words and actions of the CEO.\u201d Earlier this year, SpaceX responded to a consolidated complaint from the NLRB with its own lawsuit, alleging that the structure of the NLRB itself is \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s complaint details the statements by Musk and the actions of other workers that the fired employees claim contributed to a hostile work environment and \u201cpervasively sexist culture\u201d at SpaceX. It points to multiple crude posts by Musk on Twitter, now called X, such as one containing a plan \u201cto create a Texas university similar to MIT which he would call \u2018TITS\u2019 and where \u2018Ds [women\u2019s bra size] would get degrees,\u2019 accompanied by an altered photo rendering a rocket to appear to be a giant penis,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cThings like that were widely shared on all internal chat channels and talked about in meetings and used as fodder in professional environments,\u201d Paige\u00a0Holland-Thielen, one of the plaintiffs, told CNN\u2019s Laura Coates, adding that employees were \u201cencouraged\u201d to follow Musk on the social media platform. As a result, it became \u201cimpossible to separate his personal nonsense from the actual day-to-day life of an actual working environment,\u201d she said. The complaint also references a post from Musk, shared the day after Business Insider published a report claiming Musk had sexually harassed a flight attendant, in which the billionaire said: \u201cFinally, we get to use Elongate as scandal name. It\u2019s kinda perfect,\u201d along with a laughing emoji. (Musk has\u00a0denied\u00a0the harassment claims.) \u201cMusk\u2019s conduct of interjecting this juvenile, grotesque sexual banter into the workplace had the wholly foreseeable and intentional result of encouraging other employees to engage in similar conduct,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s complaint states. The former employees allege that engineers commonly applied \u201ccrude and demeaning names to products in an attempt at humor, often at the expense of women and LGBTQ+ individuals. For example, the name \u2018Upskirt Camera\u2019 was used for a camera on first stage of the Falcon rocket that views the bottom of the second stage,\u201d according to the complaint. In one instance, a SpaceX HR director responded to allegations of inappropriate workplace behavior at an internal event by saying: \u201cI\u2019ve never been sexually harassed; I must not be hot enough,\u201d the complaint alleges. The lawsuit adds that the former employees believe \u201cSpaceX has not taken action to redress the harassment, hostile work-environment, and retaliation.\u201d The former employees are seeking unspecified monetary damages to account for \u201clost wages, earnings, and other employee benefits, emotional distress.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details and context.

{"id": "2024_06_11_tech_elon-musk-apple-ban-openai", "text": "Elon Musk is not happy about a new partnership between Apple and ChatGPT creator OpenAI. In a post to X Monday, the Tesla (TSLA) chief executive said he would ban Apple (AAPL) devices at his companies \u2014 which include SpaceX and X, among others \u2014 if the iPhone maker went ahead with its AI plans announced Monday. If Apple \u201cintegrates OpenAI at the (operating system) level,\u201d Musk said that would constitute \u201can unacceptable security violation.\u201d He added that visitors \u201cwill have to check their Apple devices at the door, where they will be stored in a Faraday cage,\u201d referring to an enclosure that blocks electromagnetic waves crucial to communications, including cellular, wireless internet and Bluetooth signals. \u201cApple has no clue what\u2019s actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI,\u201d Musk said in a separate post. \u201cThey\u2019re selling you down the river.\u201d CNN has contacted Apple and OpenAI for comment. Musk\u2019s comments came hours after Apple unveiled the partnership with OpenAI at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, part of a wider push to bring generative artificial intelligence tools to Apple products. Under a new \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d system, AI will be used to produce a smarter Siri voice assistant and deliver more personalized tools to users. OpenAI\u2019s technology will support some of these new tools \u2014 for example, allowing users to direct questions to ChatGPT via their Apple devices. Greg Brockman, OpenAI president, said late Monday that ChatGPT would be integrated into Apple\u2019s operating systems for iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. \u201cWe\u2019re partnering with Apple to integrate ChatGPT right into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Will be available later this year, very excited!\u201d he posted on X. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015, now runs a rival firm called xAI. He has a fraught relationship with his former company and its CEO Sam Altman and is suing them both for allegedly breaching OpenAI\u2019s founding agreement and diverging from its nonprofit mission. OpenAI has in legal filings dismissed these claims as \u201cfrivolous,\u201d \u201cextraordinary\u201d and \u201ca fiction\u201d and has separately suggested Musk is essentially jealous that he is no longer involved with the company, given its success. Given his track record of broken promises and wild threats, it remains to be seen whether Musk will follow through with a ban on Apple devices or perhaps even widen it to include other brands. For example, Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL) Google and Samsung have already integrated new AI features into Android devices. Microsoft, OpenAI\u2019s biggest investor, announced three weeks ago that it would integrate AI features directly into Windows. So Musk\u2019s employees may have limited options if he wants to ban rival AI \u2014 or even OpenAI \u2014 from his companies. But Microsoft, facing a backlash over privacy concerns, said Friday that it would turn off some AI features by default. \u201cApple\u2019s AI approach is actually more privacy conscious than others, with its aim to process as much on the device as possible and with a fallback that explicitly asks users before sending information to OpenAI,\u201d said Catherine Flick, professor of ethics and games technology at Staffordshire University in England. \u201cIt remains to be seen how that workflow ends up being used in practice, but this just feels like sour grapes from Musk who runs a competing AI company that was not given the lucrative Apple contract.\u201d OpenAI has become one of the companies leading the development of generative AI. Apple, meanwhile, has lagged behind competitors, including Google and Microsoft (MSFT), which have moved more quickly to articulate an AI strategy. Apple\u2019s partnership with OpenAI could help the iPhone maker close that gap and accelerate its move into a technology that holds enormous potential. \u201cThis is a key moment for Apple, which has struggled with innovation of late,\u201d Matt Britzman, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, wrote in a note Tuesday. \u201cIntegrating a third-party tool like ChatGPT finally gets things moving, while leaving space to develop internal models over the next few years at much lower costs than the first movers.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/tech/elon-musk-apple-ban-openai/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}

The two measures \u2013 Musk\u2019s pay package from 2018 and moving the car company\u2019s incorporation state \u2013 were completed at the company\u2019s annual meeting Thursday afternoon. But the outcome of the the votes had already been revealed by Musk in a tweet overnight, when he said both measures had the support they need to pass. Tesla did not give the exact vote results, but it said preliminary results showed that Musk\u2019s pay package and the move to Texas had both passed. The compensation package, 303 million options to buy Tesla shares at a drastically reduced price, was worth $51 billion when it was voided by a Delaware judge nearly five months ago. The package was worth $48.3 billion as of Thursday\u2019s market close, due to a steady decline in Tesla share price (TSLA) this year. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on his post and had no tweet of its own or announcement on its investor sites. It did file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a collection of tweets on the subject, including the tweet from Musk. Tesla\u2019s board had said that if the shareholders didn\u2019t approve the pay package, the company won\u2019t get the attention it needs from Musk as it faces several challenges: Tesla\u2019s stock price has slid by more than half from its peak as a trillion-dollar company in late 2021, its sales have fallen short of forecasts and its profits are squeezed by a global price war for EVs that Musk started himself. The shareholders approved the original compensation package back in 2018, with 73% voting in favor. But Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick in January ruled in favor of shareholders who challenged the package. She wrote the process that Tesla board used to award the package was \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and that Musk and the board had failed to meet \u201cthe burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair.\u201d She criticized the board for being too close to the controversial CEO to represent the interests of shareholders, writing that the board committee that came up with the package included Antonio Gracias, a personal friend of Musk\u2019s who often took family vacations with the Tesla CEO, as well as Todd Maron, \u201cMusk\u2019s former divorce attorney and whose admiration for Musk moved him to tears during his deposition.\u201d In her decision throwing out the original package, McCormick rejected the argument that Musk would be uncompensated if the package was thrown out, writing, \u201cMusk\u2019s preexisting equity stake provided him tens of billions of dollars for his efforts.\u201d Trying to keep Musk\u2019s attention on Tesla Tesla\u2019s filings argue it must keep the pay package in place to keep Musk fully engaged running Tesla and not focusing on his other companies. He is also the head of SpaceX, Neuralink and the Boring Company. And in addition to being the primary shareholder of those companies, he\u2019s the owner of X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cThis is obviously not about the money,\u201d Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm wrote in a letter to shareholders. \u201cWe all know Elon is one of the wealthiest people on the planet, and he would remain so even if Tesla were to renege on the commitment we made in 2018. Elon is not a typical executive, and Tesla is not a typical company.\u201d Rather it\u2019s about \u201cwhat will motivate him to continue to create value for stockholders,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhat we recognized in 2018 and continue to recognize today is that one thing Elon most certainly does not have is unlimited time,\u201d Denholm wrote. \u201cNor does he face any shortage of ideas and other places he can make an incredible difference in the world. We want those ideas, that energy and that time to be at Tesla, for the benefit of you, our owners. But that requires reciprocal respect.\u201d Some of the supporters of the pay package include Cathie Wood, CEO and chief investment officer of Ark Invest and a long-time Tesla bull, and Ron Baron, CEO of Baron Capital, which has Tesla as one of its top holdings with a stake worth more than $2 billion. \u201cElon is the ultimate \u2018key man,\u2019\u201d said Baron in a recent statement. \u201cWithout his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla.\u201d But there are some major shareholders who have said they voted against the deal, including the California State Teachers Retirement Fund as well as the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, which has 28 million shares of Tesla stock, according to its most recent filing. \u201cWhile we appreciate the significant value generated under Mr. Musk\u2019s leadership since the grant date in 2018, we remain concerned about the total size of the award,\u201d said a statement from the Norwegian fund. Part of the problem with winning support is that Musk is far more controversial now than he was in 2018 and appears to be far less focused on simply running Tesla. He famously bought social media platform Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, selling $22.9 billion of his Tesla shares to help fund that purchase. He has been accused in multiple shareholder suits of improperly selling $7.5 billon of those shares late that year, knowing that Tesla was due to soon report disappointing sales that would reduce the company\u2019s share price. Under his management of Twitter, now known as X, he\u2019s restored accounts for users who had been banned for hate speech, advocacy of violence or misinformation. Meanwhile, allegations about widespread antisemitism on the platform and Musk\u2019s own endorsement of an antisemitic tweet have driven away many advertisers. His management of X isn\u2019t the only way he\u2019s become more controversial. This week former employees of SpaceX, of which he is also CEO and primary shareholder, filed a lawsuit allegeding they were illegally fired for raising concerns about gender discrimination and sexual harassment at the rocket company. But perhaps a more serious concern among Tesla shareholders is the pioneering electric car company itself. While shares shot up more than 1,700% between when the original package was approved in 2018 and their high point in November 2021, making Musk the richest person in the world at that time, it has lost more than half of that value since, including a 30% drop this year. Tesla has been forced to cut prices in the face of weaker demand and increased competition from other automakers offering their own EVs. One of Musk\u2019s fans on X, who tweets under the handle \u201cWholeMarsCatalog,\u201d retweeted Musk\u2019s tweet announcing the shareholder support and commented: Okay @elonmusk we got you the options. Now you have to make Tesla the most valuable company on Earth. Deal?\u201d To which Musk responded with his own tweet, \u201cYes.\u201d The ear\ufeffly market reaction to the vote was positive. Shares of Tesla rose 3% in Thursday trading. Even with Musk\u2019s pay package again endorsed by shareholders, the Delaware court could still have the final say. Tesla attorneys have told the Delaware court that the move of its incorporation to Texas is not an effort to evade Delaware jurisdiction.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/business/elon-musk-tesla-pay-billions-vote/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_success_gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy", "text": "Employees\u2019 negative daily emotions and lack of well-being can ultimately hurt worker engagement \u2013 and the economy, according to a new report released this week. Gallup, in its \u201cState of the Global Workplace,\u201d estimates that low employee engagement costs the global economy $8.9 trillion, or 9% of global GDP. The report includes findings from its latest annual World Poll, which surveyed 128,278 employees in more than 140 countries last year. That poll found that roughly 20% of workers globally reported feeling lonely, angry or sad on a daily basis. And 41% on average say they feel stress. Those most likely to say they feel lonely were younger workers (22%), employees who worked remotely full-time (25%) and those who felt most disengaged on the job (31%). While work isn\u2019t always the cause of a person\u2019s negative daily emotions, employers should still be concerned. That\u2019s because work can either improve or worsen employees\u2019 well-being. On the one hand,\u00a0the Gallup report noted,\u00a0\u201cwhen employees find their work and work relationships meaningful, employment is associated with high levels of daily enjoyment and low levels of all negative daily emotions. Notably, half of employees who are engaged at work are thriving in life overall.\u201d On the other, researchers found that being disengaged at work can negatively affect a person\u2019s wellbeing as much as \u2014 or more than \u2014 not having a job at all. \u201cEmployees who dislike their jobs tend to have high levels of daily stress and worry, as well as elevated levels of all other negative emotions,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOn many wellbeing items (stress, anger, worry, loneliness), being actively disengaged at work is equivalent to or worse than being unemployed.\u201d Engaged managers help workers thrive The poll found that last year only 23% of employees were engaged at work, unchanged from the year prior. Gallup defines an engaged employee as someone \u201chighly involved in and enthusiastic about their work and workplace. They are psychological \u2018owners,\u2019 drive performance and innovation, and move the organization forward.\u201d But those who said they were not engaged rose by 3 percentage points to 62%. These are employees characterized as \u201cpsychologically unattached to their work and company. Because their engagement needs are not being fully met, they are putting time but not energy or passion into their work.\u201d Engagement levels are highest in so-called \u201cbest practice\u201d organizations, where three-fourths of managers on average are engaged as well as seven in 10 non-managers, Gallup said. Their best practices include leaders\u2019 emphasizing well-being at work and in life; and putting a high priority on manager hiring and development. The manager piece of the equation is especially crucial. \u201c[W]hen managers are engaged, employees are more likely to be engaged,\u201d the report said. And, it added, \u201chigh-engagement business units are likely to see significantly higher employee wellbeing \u2014 as well as higher productivity, profitability and sales \u2014 than low-engagement teams.\u201d Where the most and least stressed workers are Engagement and well-being results varied in each of the 10 regions covered by Gallup\u2019s poll. The report noted that the United States and Canada, for example, showed the highest percentage of engaged employees (33%) among all the regions studied; and the third highest percentage of thriving employees (53%), behind Australia and New Zealand (60%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (54%). But the US and Canada also ranked second among employees experiencing daily stress (49%), right behind the Middle East and North Africa (52%). By contrast, Europe showed the lowest level of employee engagement (13%). South Asia scored lowest in terms of employees described as thriving overall (13%). And countries in post-Soviet Eurasia ranked lowest in terms of daily stress (19%).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/success/gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_09_business_elon-musk-pay-package-shareholder-vote", "text": "Tesla\u2019s controversial CEO Elon Musk, and his massive wealth, are front and center in a shareholder vote this coming week. Five months ago, a Delaware judge threw out the largest pay package in history, then worth more than $50 billion, that Telsa\u2019s very friendly board had given Musk in 2018. Now, Musk and the board want Tesla shareholders not only to vote again to give him back those stock options, but to relocate Tesla away from the judge\u2019s state entirely. And his board is threatening if they don\u2019t do so, they won\u2019t get the attention they need from Musk to turn around a company facing its greatest trouble in several years. Tesla\u2019s stock price slid by more than half from its peak as a trillion-dollar company in late 2021. Its sales fell short of forecasts and promises. Its profits are squeezed by a global price war for EVs that it started itself. The answer will come Thursday, when Tesla holds its annual shareholders meeting and announces results of shareholder votes on two proposals. One would once again approve the package of 303 million split-adjusted stock options, worth $46.9 billion as of Friday\u2019s closing price. That\u2019s down from the $51 billion those options were worth at the time of the decision. The shareholders approved the package back in 2018, with 73% voting in favor of it. But Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick in January ruled in favor of shareholders who challenged the package. She wrote that the company\u2019s board \u201cbore the burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair, and they failed to meet their burden.\u201d McCormick said that process the Tesla board used to create the pay package was \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and criticized the board for being to close to the famous CEO to represent the interests of the shareholders. \u201cMusk launched a self-driving process, recalibrating the speed and direction along the way as he saw fit,\u201d she wrote. Musk and Tesla reacted by appealing the ruling, and by seeking permission from shareholders to move the company\u2019s state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas, where its headquarters is located. Many major companies are incorporated in a different state from where their main offices are located, often in Delaware, which has a reputation for being business friendly. It was because of Tesla\u2019s incorporation in Delaware that McCormick was able to rule on the fairness of the pay package. Despite the widespread support among shareholders back in 2018 for Musk\u2019s pay package, the Tesla board seems to be scrambling to shore-up support for this month\u2019s vote. It has filed with the SEC more than two dozen communications with shareholders advocating for a yes vote, far more active than most companies are when seeking shareholder approval of their proxy items. It has even opened a lottery in which the winning shareholder who casts a vote gets a tour of Tesla\u2019s Texas factory conducted personally by Musk. Holding Musk\u2019s focus Tesla\u2019s filings to shareholders argue it must keep the pay package in place to keep Musk fully engaged running Tesla and not one of his other companies. \u201cThis is obviously not about the money,\u201d Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm wrote in a letter to shareholders. \u201cWe all know Elon is one of the wealthiest people on the planet, and he would remain so even if Tesla were to renege on the commitment we made in 2018. Elon is not a typical executive, and Tesla is not a typical company.\u201d Rather, she continued, it\u2019s about \u201cwhat will motivate him to continue to create value for stockholders,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhat we recognized in 2018 and continue to recognize today is that one thing Elon most certainly does not have is unlimited time,\u201d Denholm wrote. \u201cNor does he face any shortage of ideas and other places he can make an incredible difference in the world. We want those ideas, that energy and that time to be at Tesla, for the benefit of you, our owners. But that requires reciprocal respect.\u201d But part of the problem with winning support is that Musk is far more controversial than he was in 2018, and appears to be far less focused on simply running Tesla. He famously bought social media platform Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, selling $22.9 billion of his Tesla shares to help fund that purchase. He has even been accused of improperly selling $7.5 billon of those shares late that year knowing that Tesla was due to soon report disappointing sales that would reduce Tesla\u2019s price. Under his management of Twitter, since rebranded X, he\u2019s restored accounts for users who had been banned for hate speech, advocacy of violence or misinformation. Meanwhile, allegations about widespread antisemitism on the platform, and Musk\u2019s own endorsement of antisemitic tweets, has driven away many advertisers and caused widespread losses. But perhaps a more serious concern among Tesla shareholders is problems faced by the electric car pioneer itself. While shares shot up more than 1,700% between when the original package was approved in 2018 and its high point in November 2021, making Musk the richest person in the world at that time, it has lost more than half of that value since, including a 30% drop this year. Tesla has been forced to cut prices in the face of weaker than forecast demand for sales, and increased competition from other automakers offering their own EVs. \u201cThis shareholder vote is happening at the most tenuous time for Musk,\u201d said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities and an analyst who is still bullish on Tesla shares. \u201cAfter Tesla went through a Cinderella ride, it\u2019s become a horror show. There\u2019s a group of shareholders who are frustrated. And this is a shot across the bow for them to show they\u2019re not satisfied.\u201d While Ives thinks that the pay package will again be approved by shareholders in the current vote, he said it will be a much closer vote this time. He said despite Tesla\u2019s problems and the controversy swirling around Musk, many shareholders believe keeping him at the company, and focused on Tesla more than SpaceX, his new artificial intelligence company xAI, The Boring Company, Neuralink and his rebranded social media company X, or his other ventures, is crucial for the company\u2019s future. Musk has even said he would not want to grow Tesla to become a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics, as he has promised, without a compensation plan that would give him ownership of around 25% of the company\u2019s stock. That would be about double the roughly 13% stake he currently owns. \u201cIt comes down to Musk,\u201d Ives said. \u201cMusk is still the hearts and lungs of the Tesla growth story.\u201d Supporters, opponents to Musk options Some high profile shareholders have spoken out in favor of Musk ahead of the vote, including Ron Baron, CEO of Baron Capital, which has Tesla as one of its top holdings with  a stake worth more than $2 billion in the company. \u201cElon\u2019s compensation contract contained aggressive performance metrics that few in 2018 believed could be achieved. If these aggressive performance metrics had not been achieved, Elon would have received\u00a0nothing,\u201d Baron said in a recent statement. \u201cWhen Tesla achieved targeted earnings, revenues, and market cap metrics, Tesla\u2019s shareholders benefitted greatly. He performed under his compensation contract. He earned his pay. Elon is the ultimate \u2018key man.\u2019\u00a0Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla.\u201d But there are also high profile opponents of the deal including Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, two firms that advise investors on how to vote on proxy proposals. Both are urging no votes on Musk\u2019s package. \u201cThe award value was considered outsized from the start,\u201d wrote ISS. \u201cSome investors may find the board\u2019s argument compelling, that it would be unfair for CEO Musk not to receive the award. However, the concerns raised, both back in 2018 and in the interim, have not been sufficiently mitigated.\u201d On Saturday, the Norwegian government\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, which holds 28 million shares of Tesla, according to its most recent filing, said it had voted those shares against the pay package, adding that it did the same back in 2018. \u201cWhile we appreciate the significant value generated under Mr. Musk\u2019s leadership since the grant date in 2018, we remain concerned about the total size of the award, the structure given performance triggers, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk,\u201d said its statement. It said it had voted in favor of the shift of incorporation to Texas. On X, Musk criticized the the decision of the sovereign fund to vote no. \u201cYeah, this is not cool,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIf they actually surveyed their constituents, they would discover overwhelming support in favor. So far, roughly 90% of retail shareholders who have voted have voted in favor of both resolutions. The public sentiment is unequivocally supportive.\u201d In her decision throwing out the original package, McCormick rejected the argument that Musk would be uncompensated if the package was thrown out, writing, \u201cMusk\u2019s preexisting equity stake provided him tens of billions of dollars for his efforts.\u201d And it could continue to be up to the courts in Delaware to decide if Musk gets the options restored, no matter how the shareholders vote this month, and whether or not they approve incorporating in Texas. The attorneys for Tesla have told the court in Delaware that the companies\u2019 desire to move its incorporation to Texas is not an effort to evade jurisdiction from the original court order in Delaware as that case is appealed. But the outcome of the vote could decide how much Musk wants to continue to be involved with Tesla, the company that made him so rich and so famous before he became so controversial.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/09/business/elon-musk-pay-package-shareholder-vote/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important.

{"id": "2024_06_13_business_waymo-recalls-driverless-cars-poles", "text": "Waymo issued a recall for its 672 driverless cars to make them less likely to drive into telephone poles. The recall follows a May 21 accident in Phoenix, Arizona, in which a Waymo driverless car hit a telephone pole that was installed in the roadway in an alley. The vehicle was pulling over to pick up a passenger when it struck the pole at low speed, according to Waymo. While the car was severely damaged, no one was hurt, according to documents Waymo filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The recall applies only to the fleet of modified Jaguar I-Pace SUVs Waymo owns and operates itself. The recall involves a software update on all 672 of the vehicles. The recall was first reported by The Verge. \u201cWe have already deployed mapping and software updates across our entire fleet, and this does not impact our current operations,\u201d a Waymo spokesperson said in an email. In documents filed with the National Highway Traffic Administration, Waymo described the issue is as an \u201c[i]nsufficient ability to avoid pole or pole-like permanent objects within the drivable surface [which] may result in an increased risk of a collision.\u201d This became an issue in circumstances where there wasn\u2019t a curb or clear road shoulder \u2013 such as in an alleyway where the road surface reaches from buildings on one side to buildings on the other \u2013 and there were poles installed within that roadway. In that case, the vehicle might not have recognized the actual degree of hazard a pole represented. To correct the problem, Waymo updated the software for its driverless vehicles to make them more likely to avoid things that appear to be poles in the road and, also, by improving their maps to better define the edges of roads, even where they might not be clear. Waymo is the autonomous vehicle subsidiary of Alphabet, the parent company of Google. It currently offers driverless taxi rides in Phoenix, Los Angeles and San Francisco.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/business/waymo-recalls-driverless-cars-poles/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "business_apple-lawsuit-gender-pay-discrimination", "text": "Two female employees at Apple sued the company on Thursday, alleging the company paid women less than men for the same work. The women are proposing a class action, seeking to represent more than 12,000 current and former female employees in the engineering, marketing and AppleCare divisions. Apple is not the first major tech company to face legal challenges for alleged gender discrimination. Google in 2018 agreed to pay $118 million to settle a class action gender discrimination lawsuit, and Oracle agreed to pay $25 million to settle a class action alleging underpaying female employees. Neither company admitted wrongdoing. The lawsuit centers on Apple\u2019s hiring practices and performance evaluations, which the women allege pushed a wage gap between men and women. California made it illegal for employers to ask job candidates about their prior pay in 2018. Instead, since January 2018, Apple asked about pay expectations, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit alleges that Apple used the pay expectation information to set starting salaries, which had lower pay rates for women compared to men who did similar work. The lawsuit also claims that the performance evaluations are biased against women, because parameters such as teamwork and leadership tend to reward men and punish women. This can affect women\u2019s promotions and bonuses, the lawsuit alleged. Justina Jong, a customer and technical training instructor and one of two plaintiffs, said in a release from her attorneys that she noticed a W-2 left on the office printer by a male colleague. \u201cI noticed that he was being paid almost $10,000 more than me, even though we performed substantially similar work. This revelation made me feel terrible,\u201d Jong said in a statement. The lawsuit also alleges that Jong was forced to work in a hostile work environment next to a co-worker who had sexually harassed her. The other plaintiff, Amina Salgado, said she complained to Apple numerous times about the wage gap, according to the lawsuit. Salgado has worked in several roles for Apple since 2012, according to the suit. Eventually, she said, Apple hired a third-party firm to conduct an investigation, which found that she was paid less. \u201cAs a result of the third-party investigation, in late 2023, Apple increased Ms. Salgado\u2019s compensation prospectively, but failed and refused to pay Ms. Salgado back pay for the years during which she was paid less than men performing substantially similar work,\u201d the lawsuit alleged. The lawsuit claims the class members are entitled to compensation from the loss of fair wages, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.

{"id": "2024_06_13_investing_us-russia-sanctions-dollar-euro-trading", "text": "New\u00a0US sanctions\u00a0against Russia have caused an immediate suspension of trading in dollars and euros on the country\u2019s leading financial marketplace, the\u00a0Moscow Exchange. The exchange, also known as MOEX, and the Russian central bank rushed out statements Wednesday, a public holiday in Russia, within an hour of Washington announcing a new round of sanctions aimed at cutting the flow of money and goods to sustain Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine. \u201cDue to the introduction of restrictive measures by the United States against the\u00a0Moscow Exchange\u00a0Group, exchange trading and settlements of deliverable instruments in US dollars and euros are suspended,\u201d the central bank said. The move means banks, companies and investors will no longer be able to trade either currency via a central exchange, which offers advantages such as better liquidity and oversight. Instead, they will have to trade over the counter, where deals are conducted directly between two parties. The central bank said it would use data from those trades to set official exchange rates. Many Russians hold savings in dollars or euros, mindful of periodic crises in recent decades when the ruble has crashed in value. The central bank reassured people these deposits were secure. \u201cCompanies and individuals can continue to buy and sell US dollars and euros through Russian banks. All funds in US dollars and euros in the accounts and deposits of citizens and companies remain safe,\u201d it said. One person at a large, non-sanctioned Russian commodities exporter told Reuters: \u201cWe don\u2019t care, we have yuan. Getting dollars and euros in Russia is practically impossible.\u201d With Moscow pursuing closer trade and political ties with Beijing, China\u2019s yuan has ousted the dollar to become MOEX\u2019s most traded currency, accounting for 53.6% of all foreign currency traded in May. Dollar-ruble trading volume on MOEX tends to be around 1 billion rubles ($11 million) a day, while euro-ruble trading hovers at around 300 million rubles ($3 million) daily. For yuan-ruble trading, daily volumes now regularly top 8 billion rubles ($90 million). Dollar rates jump On the eve of the national holiday, the ruble closed at 89.10 to the dollar\u00a0and at 95.62 against the euro. Following the sanctions news, some banks immediately jacked up their dollar rates. Norvik Bank said Wednesday that it was offering to buy dollars for just 50 rubles but sell for 200 rubles, though it later adjusted the rates to 88.20/97.80. Tsifra Bank was buying dollars at 89 rubles and selling at 120. The US Treasury said it was \u201ctargeting the architecture of Russia\u2019s financial system, which has been reoriented to facilitate investment into its defense industry and acquisition of goods needed to further its aggression against Ukraine.\u201d Russia\u2019s central bank has been bracing for such sanctions for around two years. In July 2022, the bank said it was modeling various sanctions scenarios with foreign exchange market participants and infrastructure organizations. \u201cThis is bad but expected news,\u201d Russian broker T-Investments said on Telegram. Forbes Russia had reported in 2022 that the central bank was discussing a mechanism for managing the ruble-dollar exchange rate should exchange trading be halted in the event of sanctions against MOEX and its National Clearing Centre, which was also hit by the new sanctions. MOEX said share trading and money market trades settled in dollars and euros would also cease.

{"id": "2024_06_13_cars_eu-ev-tariffs-china-effects-analysis-intl-hnk", "text": "After months of investigation, the European Union has announced additional tariffs on electric vehicles (EV) imported from China, because of what it sees as Beijing\u2019s unfair support for companies that undercut European carmakers. The decision deals a blow to the Chinese government, which had been lobbying hard against the taxes, and EV producers in the country. Most companies are facing hefty extra tariffs of between 17.4% and 38.1%, on top of the 10% duty already levied by the bloc. The impact on China\u2019s EV makers will vary depending on the level of tariff and each company\u2019s cost structure. Those hardest hit may be forced to raise prices or set up factories in Europe. And while Beijing is clearly unhappy,\u00a0analysts say it\u2019s unlikely to want to rush into a full-blown trade war with its\u00a0second biggest trading partner, not least because of economic pressures at home. For market leader BYD, which vies with Tesla as the world\u2019s top producer of battery electric vehicles, there\u2019s still space for it to grow in Europe, even with the additional duty, according to Gregor Sebastian, a senior analyst with the Rhodium Group. Facing the lowest additional levy of 17.4%, BYD could emerge as a relative \u201cwinner,\u201d he said. Duties at this level could even allow BYD to cut its already competitive prices to gain market share in Europe. \u201cBYD is already building a factory in Europe, is likely to still profitably export to the EU even with 17% duties, and can export plug-in hybrids without additional duties,\u201d Sebastian said. The new tariffs only target battery EVs. Rhodium said in April that BYD\u2019s European profits are 45% higher than in China, meaning that market will still remain highly attractive even after the new tariffs are imposed. China\u2019s top market Europe is key to Beijing\u2019s EV ambitions. It overtook Asia as China\u2019s largest EV export market in 2021. That helped propel China into pole position as the world\u2019s No 1 car exporter. \u201cOne critical issue for China is that the EU accounted for 38% of China\u2019s EV exports in 2023,\u201d Sebastian said. \u201cChina will not be able to reroute exports to other countries as potential alternatives like Brazil, Turkey and the US have also pulled up drawbridges.\u201d Last month, the United States quadrupled tariffs on EVs from China, from 25% to 100%, aiming to boost American jobs and manufacturing. \u201cThe EU is the only market left that is both wealthy and large enough to absorb a meaningful amount of China\u2019s excess production of EVs,\u201d said Etienne Soula, a research analyst with Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. The Chinese government has big dreams for the country\u2019s EV industry, part of a broader strategy to surpass America in the global tech race. It\u2019s also trying to counter a property-induced economic slowdown and promote a low-carbon economy. EVs, along with photovoltaics and lithium-ion batteries, are seen by the government as the \u201cnew three\u201d growth drivers that will play a pivotal role in shaping the country\u2019s economic landscape. In February, nine government agencies, including the Commerce Ministry and the central bank, vowed to provide support to accelerate Chinese EV makers\u2019 global push. Tesla prices to rise In contrast to BYD, state-owned carmaker SAIC is in a \u201cdisastrous\u201d situation facing 38.1% in additional tariffs, according to Sebastian. EV sales in the EU accounted for 15% of the company\u2019s total sales in 2023 and early 2024.\u00a0The Shanghai-based automaker, which was China\u2019s second largest seller of battery EVs, pug-in hybrids and fuel cell cars (NEVs) last year, will likely need to build a factory in Europe to bypass these duties. Geely, China\u2019s fourth largest NEV retailer and the owner of Volvo, faces 20% in additional duties, a penalty which is likely to be a \u201cmixed bag,\u201d Sebastian said. His analysis suggests Geely could still profitably export to the EU, but margins will narrow severely. For Tesla (TSLA), which uses China as its base for global exports including to Europe, the situation is also tricky. The European Commission said Wednesday that the EV giant may receive an individually calculated duty rate at a future stage following a request by the carmaker. In a message posted to its website in several European countries Thursday, Tesla said it expected to have to raise prices for its Model 3 from July 1 because of the new tariffs. Sebastian said additional duties above 21% would likely render Tesla\u2019s exports from China to the EU uncompetitive. Localization coming The EU\u2019s move is likely to hasten efforts by Chinese carmakers to set up factories in the region. The \u201cannouncement is more likely to accelerate the extent to which Chinese [EV companies] and suppliers manufacture their products within Europe, something that we have already started to see,\u201d said Andrew Bergbaum, global co-head of AlixPartners\u2019\u00a0automotive & industrial practice. BYD announced in December that it would build an EV factory in Hungary, becoming the first major Chinese automaker to build passenger cars in Europe. While the tariffs would not be good news for consumers and cities with zero emission needs, \u201cthe establishment of new European-manufactured electric vehicles by Chinese companies would certainly be welcomed,\u201d said Bergbaum. However, it also means there will be more competition in a sector that already has too much capacity, leading to large scale disruptions of existing manufacturing sites as they \u201crebalance their resources\u201d, he added. UBS analysts, meanwhile, predicted on Wednesday that the number of Chinese manufacturers making inroads in the EU would become \u201cmore concentrated.\u201d Smaller players may become discouraged and give up, even as Chinese industry leaders press ahead. But they also expected Chinese companies to accelerate the location of assembly plants in the EU, a move which would be welcomed by EU member states like Hungry, Italy, and Spain. Too much to lose Ahead of the announcement, Beijing had dropped hints that it could retaliate. Its ministries of commerce and foreign ministries each reiterated Wednesday that China would take \u201call necessary measures\u201d to defend its interests. Analysts, though, don\u2019t believe there is a high chance of serious escalation. \u201cThe situation is unlikely to develop into a full-blown trade war, both sides have too much to lose,\u201d Sebastian said. Soula said China could retaliate by imposing tariffs on some European goods such as luxury cars, premium brandies or airplane parts. But given the economic pressures that China is already under, it has \u201climited room\u201d for maneuver when responding to the EU. Also, \u201cthere is still the possibility of (EU) countries who are skeptical of this investigation coming together to diminish the final level of the tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this context, China may want to wait before going all out to avoid hardening attitudes in those member states.\u201d Currently provisional, the tariffs are due to be introduced on July 4 if discussions with Chinese authorities don\u2019t lead to a mutual agreement.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/cars/eu-ev-tariffs-china-effects-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_economy_ppi-wholesale-inflation-may", "text": "Americans and the Federal Reserve have another positive development to celebrate: More evidence that price pressures are fading. Wholesale inflation cooled significantly in May, with prices down 0.2% from April\u2019s 0.5% increase, according to data the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Thursday. Economists polled by FactSet had anticipated a 0.1% rise in monthly wholesale inflation. A 4.8% in energy prices last month was a major contributor to falling overall wholesale prices. The Producer Price Index, which measures the change in prices that manufacturers pay to suppliers, rose 2.2% for the 12 months ended in May, matching April\u2019s increase. FactSet consensus estimates had the annual increase at 2.5%. Excluding food and energy prices, so-called \u201ccore\u201d producer inflation rose 2.3% on an annual basis, the same level seen in April. Economists were expecting to see a larger acceleration of 2.5%. On a monthly basis, core inflation was flat, also unchanged from April, while economists had forecast a 0.3% rise. PPI captures average price shifts before they reach consumers and serves as a potential bellwether for retail-level inflation in the months ahead. On the goods side, deflation effects were even stronger, with prices falling 0.8% in May, the largest monthly decline since October 2023. On the services side, prices rose 0.6%, the same level seen in April. The new inflation data follows May\u2019s Consumer Price Index released Wednesday, which showed that the pace of price increase consumers see across goods and services cooled to 3.3% from 3.4% in April. On a monthly basis, prices held flat for the first time since July 2022. On the same day, Federal Reserve officials voted to keep interest rates at current levels, which are the highest in 23 years. But they still kept the door open to cutting interest rates later this year, albeit fewer times than they indicated at March\u2019s meeting, according to new median projections. Fed officials did not have access to Thursday\u2019s data when they met. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he\u2019d be paying close attention to it for clues about the path of inflation. To cut or not to cut? Some market observers saw Thursday\u2019s data as a sign that the Fed will gain more of the confidence it needs to feel comfortable lowering interest rates. \u201cIt keeps the prospect of a rate cut alive in 2024,\u201d Clark Bellin, president and chief investment officer at Bellwether Wealth, said in a note Thursday morning. If the trend seen in May\u2019s PPI data continues, said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, it could lead the Fed to cut rates as soon as September. But others expressed concerns that the fall in producer prices may actually represent a negative consequence. \u201cThe better readings on inflation this month look like they are only occurring because economic growth has stalled and the\u00a0country is in danger of going over a cliff,\u201d said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds. \u201cThis is exactly what an economy looks like when the country enters a recession and it will be a miracle if we miss one. The Fed missed the inflation outbreak and now it looks increasingly like they misread the risks of recession and soaring job losses,\u201d Rupkey said in a note Thursday. Potential evidence of a weakening economy was seen in Thursday\u2019s weekly jobless claims data. Initial jobless claims rose by 13,000 to 242,000 for the week ending June 8, the highest level in 10 months \u2014 though the data is volatile and can be frequently revised. Stocks opened mixed after the release of PPI and jobless claims data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 250 points lower, or 0.6%, in morning trading; while the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 opened slightly higher. The latter two indexes both closed at fresh record highs on Wednesday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/economy/ppi-wholesale-inflation-may/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}

Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_tech_apple-ai-data-openai-artificial-intelligence", "text": "Apple\u2019s splashy announcement at its Worldwide Developers Conference this week that it\u2019s adding artificial intelligence to its products, and partnering with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has raised many questions about how Apple\u2019s AI offerings will work. The confusion is understandable. Apple is simultaneously launching a proprietary suite of AI models while also integrating ChatGPT into its devices and software. So it\u2019s natural to wonder where one ends and the other begins and \u2014 perhaps more pressingly \u2014 what both companies will do with the personal information they receive from users. The stakes are particularly high for Apple, a company that has made security and privacy a hallmark of its brand. Here\u2019s what we know. The difference between Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT If Apple has its own AI, why does it need ChatGPT? The answer is that each is meant to do different things. Apple Intelligence \u2014 the collective brand name for all of Apple\u2019s own AI tools \u2014 is intended to be more of a personal assistant than anything else, with an emphasis on \u201cpersonal.\u201d It takes in specific information about your relationships and contacts, messages and emails you\u2019ve sent, events you\u2019ve been to, meetings on your calendar and other highly individualized bits of data about your life. And then it uses that data to, Apple hopes, make your life a little easier \u2014 helping you dig up a photo you took from that concert years ago, finding the right attachment to put on an email, or ranking your mobile notifications by priority and urgency. But while Apple Intelligence might know that you went on a hiking trip last year, it will lack what company executives called \u201cworld knowledge\u201d \u2014 more general information about history, current events and other things that are less directly linked to you. That\u2019s where ChatGPT comes in. Users will be able to have Siri forward questions and prompts to ChatGPT \u2014\u00a0on an opt-in basis \u2014 or have ChatGPT help you write documents within Apple apps. Apple said it plans to integrate with other third-party AI models eventually, too. The integration essentially removes a step to accessing ChatGPT and gives Apple users a more seamless onramp to that platform. What does this mean for my data? Since Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT will be used for largely different purposes, the amount and type of information users send to each AI may be different, too. Apple Intelligence will have access to a wide range of your personal data, from your written communications to photos and videos you\u2019ve taken to a record of your calendar events. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to prevent Apple Intelligence from accessing this information, short of not using its features; an Apple spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately respond to questions on that topic. ChatGPT won\u2019t necessarily or automatically have access to your highly personal details, although you might choose to share some of this data and more with OpenAI if you decide to use ChatGPT through Apple. In Monday\u2019s demo, Apple showed Siri asking the user for permission to send a prompt to ChatGPT before doing so. As part of its agreement with Apple, OpenAI made an important concession: OpenAI agreed not to store any prompts from Apple users or to collect their IP addresses \u2014 though all bets are off if you consciously decide to log in and connect an existing ChatGPT account. Some users might\u00a0choose to do\u00a0that\u00a0to take advantage of their ChatGPT history or the benefits associated with ChatGPT\u2019s paid account plans. Should you trust Apple with your data? Now that we\u2019ve established what OpenAI will and won\u2019t do with your data, what about Apple? While Apple users will have to send their personal information and AI queries to OpenAI if they want to use ChatGPT, Apple has said that most of the time Apple Intelligence won\u2019t be sending user data anywhere. As much as possible, Apple will try to process AI prompts directly on your device using smaller AI models. This is similar to how Apple already processes FaceID and other sensitive data \u2014 the idea being that processing data right on the device limits risky exposure. Your data can\u2019t be intercepted or hacked from a central server if it never actually goes anywhere. In the event your AI task needs more processing power, Apple Intelligence will send your query and data to a cloud computing platform controlled by Apple, where a more capable AI model will fulfill the request. This is where Apple claims it has achieved a major privacy breakthrough. The company\u2019s announcement received relatively little airtime during its jam-packed Monday keynote but the company is plainly proud of the advancement it\u2019s clearly been extensively planning. Apple said Monday it has developed a new way to do cloud computing that means Apple can run computations on sensitive data while ensuring that nobody, not even the company itself, can tell what data is being processed or what computation is being done. Known as Private Cloud Compute, Apple\u2019s new architecture borrows certain hardware and security concepts from the iPhone, including the secure enclave that already protects sensitive user data on Apple mobile devices. With Private Cloud Compute, \u201cyour data is never stored or made accessible to Apple,\u201d said Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s SVP of software engineering, during Monday\u2019s keynote. After fulfilling a user\u2019s AI request, Private Cloud Compute scrubs itself of any user data involved in the process, Apple said. Apple claims Private Cloud Compute\u00a0is \u201conly possible\u201d because of the tight control it has over its entire technology ecosystem \u2014 from the specialized, proprietary computer chips to the software tying everything together. If it\u2019s true that Apple can\u2019t see the personal data that its large AI models are crunching \u2014 a claim Apple invited researchers to test for themselves because the system\u2019s design is meant to be scrutinized \u2014 then that sets Apple\u2019s implementation apart from that of other companies. For example, when you use ChatGPT, OpenAI discloses that it uses your data to further train its AI models. With Private Cloud Compute, you theoretically won\u2019t have to take Apple\u2019s word that it doesn\u2019t use your data for AI training. What about Apple\u2019s training data? Apple\u2019s AI models didn\u2019t spring up out of nowhere. They had to be trained, too, just like models offered by other companies. And that raises questions about whose data Apple used, and how. In a technical document released this week, Apple said its models are trained \u201con licensed data, including data selected to enhance specific features.\u201d \u201cWe never use our users\u2019 private personal data or user interactions when training our foundation models,\u201d the company added, \u201cand we apply filters to remove personally identifiable information like social security and credit card numbers that are publicly available on the Internet.\u201d Apple did, however, admit to scraping the public internet for data that then went into training its proprietary models, making it somewhat similar to other AI companies, some of whom have faced copyright lawsuits and sparked a debate over whether AI startups have unfairly profited off the work of humans. Apple hasn\u2019t said what web-based information it has ingested. It did say that publishers can add code to their sites to prevent Apple\u2019s web crawler from collecting their data. But that places the burden squarely on publishers to safeguard their own intellectual property, not the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/tech/apple-ai-data-openai-artificial-intelligence/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_12_business_disney-desantis-backed-board-new-agreement", "text": "In a development agreement unanimously approved Wednesday night, Disney promises to invest up to $17 billion in its Florida resort over the next 10 to 20 years and sets up the framework for potential theme park expansions. The 15-year agreement was negotiated as part of a settlement following a yearslong legal dispute between Disney and Gov. Ron DeSantis. The newly renamed entity, Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, oversees all public services for the Walt Disney World resort area and now has board supervisors chosen by the governor. \u201cI would say it\u2019s a huge deal and that both sides have come to their senses,\u201d said Aubrey Jewett, a political science professor at the University of Central Florida. \u201cAnd realize that this is the best path forward.\u201d After the vote, Board Supervisor Brian Aungst Jr. said this was \u201cthe day we have all been very much looking forward to.\u201d He said he used the term \u2018we\u2019 to encompass all who have a stake in the matter, from residents of Florida, to business owners in the area, to employees of Disney. \u201cWalt Disney World is inextricably intertwined in the fabric of the state of Florida. And the success of Walt Disney World is the success of Central Florida, and vice versa,\u201d he said. Wednesday evening, the president of Walt Disney World Resort, Jeff Vahle, said, \u201cThis new development agreement paves the way for us to invest billions of dollars in Walt Disney World Resort, supporting the growth of this global destination, fueling the Florida economy, and allowing us to deliver even more memorable and extraordinary experiences for our guests.\u201d What\u2019s in the deal The agreement sets expectations on what services Disney may need CFTOD to provide in the coming years, as it looks to expand. The promised spending, of up to $17 billion, is part of Disney\u2019s previous announcement that the company would invest $60 billion overall on global parks and cruises over the next 10 years. As Disney begins such projects, CFTOD is responsible for maintaining the infrastructure in the theme park region, such as roads and bridges, fire services, emergency medical response, wastewater and electrical power generation. Disney World has agreed to fund $10 million in attainable housing projects and to create a local business hiring program where more than half the value of all construction work will go to Florida-based businesses. The agreement also shows two tables, vaguely describing Disney\u2019s comprehensive plan of five major and five minor theme parks, though Disney has not commented on whether these numbers indicate an eventual goal of building that many parks in the area. The Disney World resort is currently home to four theme parks and two water parks. Out of the $17 billion, \u201cit\u2019s my opinion that $8 to $10 billion will be dedicated towards a new fifth gate. It\u2019s been 26 years since Disney has opened a new theme park in Florida,\u201d said Dennis Speigel, owner and founder of International Theme Park Services, a global consultant for theme park projects. Speigel, who is not involved in Disney\u2019s plans, said the company needs to build a fifth theme park to maintain the mantle as Orlando\u2019s \u201cleader\u201d in theme parks, as their competitor, Universal, prepares to open its new theme park, Epic Universe, in 2025. Coming off a bumpy ride But launching new Disney World projects had been complicated in recent years because of Disney\u2019s legal woes against the state of Florida. In 2022, Gov. DeSantis signed into law the so-called \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill, prohibiting educators from teaching sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. The law also prohibited all employees and contractors of public K-12 schools from using a student\u2019s preferred personal pronoun if that pronoun does not correspond to the person\u2019s sex. After Disney\u2019s initial silence on the issue, then-CEO Bob Chapek publicly took a stand against the law after mounting pressure from employees. In what was perceived as retaliation, DeSantis later dissolved the special Reedy Creek Improvement District, created by the Florida legislature and effectively gave Disney the power to control municipal services around its theme parks that didn\u2019t exist before Walt Disney and his builders arrived in Florida. It had been in place at Disney World since 1967 and freed Disney from bureaucratic red tape, making it cheaper to borrow to finance infrastructure projects around its theme parks, among other significant advantages. That special arrangement, though criticized at times, was largely protected by state politicians as both Disney and Florida benefited from the tourism boom. \u201cAll the board members of Reedy Creek were selected by Disney because the special district government was set up where each property owner got one vote per acre,\u201d Jewett said. \u201cAnd since Disney owns 80% of the property in this district, they of course controlled all the votes.\u201d Jewett said if Disney wanted to do something at Disney World, Reedy Creek agreed to it. \u201cThere was no mystery,\u201d Jewett said. But dissolution of the special district would have saddled local taxpayers with Disney\u2019s debts and providing public services for the 25,000-acre resort. Instead, DeSantis kept the district but changed its name. He also changed control of the board so that he would appoint its supervisors. Jewett said DeSantis turned up the heat at one point by suggesting \u201cthat they might allow a competing theme park to build on or near Disney property, or maybe they\u2019d put in a prison or a jail\u2026He overtly and sometimes more quietly basically was threatening Disney.\u201d In May of 2023, Disney canceled its plans for a new billion-dollar Florida campus that would have brought 2,000 jobs to the state. In January, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit by Disney accusing DeSantis of weaponizing his political power to punish the company for exercising its right to free speech. In March, as part of a settlement, Disney and Florida also agreed to drop various statewide lawsuits they\u2019d filed against one another. \u201cThere was a lot of work behind the scenes. By then, DeSantis had his presidential ambitions, at least for the time being\u2026down the tubes, and he had gotten some pushback from a number of Republicans,\u201d Jewett said. Speigel said, \u201cIt was a lose-lose situation when they broke up. It\u2019s a win-win situation getting back together. Orlando is the Mecca of the theme park industry, and for it to function, Disney and Florida have to function together.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/business/disney-desantis-backed-board-new-agreement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_media_rachel-maddow-authoritarianism-trump", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Rachel Maddow\u00a0is back with another podcast. The\u00a0MSNBC\u00a0star on Monday\u00a0debuted the second season\u00a0of her acclaimed audio series,\u00a0\u201cUltra.\u201d\u00a0Over eight episodes, the program is set to explore \u201can all-but-forgotten\u201d true story from America\u2019s post-World War II\u00a0history that mirrors the frightening politics of our current moment. In fact, the show\u2019s synopsis \u2014 which makes mention of a foreign influence operation, a \u201cHail Mary scheme to stop the counting of the\u00a0Electoral College\u00a0votes,\u201d and the \u201cfraying\u201d line between \u201cthe violent ultra-right and mainstream American politics\u201d \u2014 reads like a description of the 2024 political state of play. We spoke with Maddow via email about the new season of \u201cUltra,\u201d the 2024 campaign, and whether she fears she might be a target of\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0wrath should he win a second term. Her answers are presented below, unedited. You\u2019re one of the highest rated hosts on television. What is unique about the audio format that makes it attractive to you as a storyteller?\u00a0I started in radio long before I ever somehow finagled my way onto TV, so when I\u2019m working out how to explain things or express myself or tell stories, I still think first about the spoken word. Audio also requires a little more precision in the writing and the delivery than TV does \u2014 in a visual medium, you can round off the edges a little bit with on-screen elements and body language, neither of which is available when all you have is a microphone. For projects that have a longer dramatic arc, like\u00a0\u2018Ultra\u2019\u00a0and\u00a0\u2018Bag Man,\u2019\u00a0I think the precision and rigor that audio production demands can build out the story in a way that hopefully makes it worthy of four or five hours of attention from listeners over the course of the season. For an anthology series like\u00a0\u2018D\u00e9j\u00e0 News,\u2019\u00a0I think the audio format helps showcase archival sound in way that\u2019s really cool \u2014 not to mention the fact that my co-host (and longtime TRMS producer)\u00a0Isaac-Davy Aronson\u00a0has the world\u2019s greatest radio voice, so that\u2019s an irresistible draw for me. Season two of \u201cUltra\u201d uses history to focus on \u201cthe frayed line between violent extremism and mainstream politics.\u201d That is a topic that is more relevant than ever these days, given the radicalization of the Republican Party under the leadership of Donald Trump. What important lesson can we learn from history to help us in this moment? I think that knowing the country has faced similar threats in the past (and I stress similar, not exactly the same) can help set expectations for how things might go this time around. As one example, we can observe in U.S. history that one of the risks of violent extremists getting intertwined with normal electoral politics is that people with political power will put inappropriate pressure on the criminal justice system when their allied extremists are charged with crimes. We should also know that DOJ hasn\u2019t always been great at resisting that pressure. Seeing that in our past should help us expect that and hopefully brace ourselves against it in our own time. As another example, it\u2019s somehow comforting and discomfiting at the same time to look at previous instances where factually-unhinged conspiratorial narratives have taken hold in mainstream politics. One of the takeaways from that history is just the confirmation that, yes, we\u2019re quite susceptible to that as a country; but also that patient, responsible, consistent debunking, and criticism of those lies has an effect on the American people. It takes a long time and it doesn\u2019t reach everyone, but it can influence the median voter in a way that ultimately can be decisive. When thinking about radicalization in America, the information environment plays a crucial role. What parallels did you find in the post-war 1950s and today? And would you say that the media environment is worse then or now? The media environment in the United States is a constantly shifting crazy-quilt landscape of authority, irresponsibility, partisanship, objectivity, heroism, corruption, and competition. We like to think of it as a riches-to-rags linear progression from good old days to today\u2019s mess. But it\u2019s kind of always been a mess. Don\u2019t believe me? Read the America-focused chapters in\u00a0Kathryn Olmsted\u2019s\u00a0\u201cThe Newspaper Axis: Six Press Barons Who Enabled Hitler.\u201d\u00a0Or pour yourself a stiff shot of something and spend some time with the mass media titan that was\u00a0Charles Coughlin\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Tablet Magazine\u2019s \u201cRadioactive\u201d\u00a0podcast\u00a0about him is a great place to start. In the time period covered by Season Two of \u201cUltra,\u201d there was the same mix of great and terrible, sometimes within the same outlet. Both\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0and\u00a0TIME\u00a0magazine, for example, fell hook line and sinker for a really gross foreign influence propaganda operation in 1949, while at the same time they were publishing prescient, urgent, and unique reporting from their foreign correspondents on the same malign actors who were perpetrating that hoax. So there\u2019s always a mix of good and bad. The best of our traditions, I think, should inspire us to keep trying to balance humility and ambition. Police professional standards really aggressively; be as transparent about sourcing as you are wary of liars; expect that you\u2019ll make mistakes and have a plan for fixing them when you do. One thing that stands out to me is that sunlight no longer appears to be an effective disinfectant. In fact, often the sunlight appears to help grow these sinister forces, given they feed off of attention. What do you make of that when looking back in history? It\u2019s frustrating in the moment, I know \u2014 we all face that question in daily news production every day: do I ignore this lie, thus letting it slide by unrebutted; or do I discuss the lie, thereby debunking it but also implicitly amplifying it in the process? There isn\u2019t a one-sized-fits-all solution for every lie. But knowing that the avalanche of lies is a political tactic at least helps us expect it, and hopefully to explain its tactical function to our audiences. Forewarned is forearmed. In\u00a0Robert Paxton\u2019s\u00a0\u201cAnatomy of Fascism,\u201d\u00a0he quotes Mussolini\u2019s answer to a question about his governing plans soon after he became prime minister: \u201cThe democrats of Il Mondo [newspaper in Rome] want to know our program? It is to break the bones of the democrats of Il Mondo. And the sooner the better.\u201d Authoritarian movements don\u2019t just hate journalists as a professional class, they want to destroy the idea that there is any knowable truth other than what the leader insists upon. When you come across someone in politics who is not just wrong but proudly irrational, they\u2019re not looking for a fact-check, they\u2019re looking for a fight. On the topic of debating whether to give certain politicians attention or not, I am curious about your current thinking on news networks broadcasting Trump live. For a little while, CNN and MSNBC declined to do so. But lately, that has changed. Do you believe that is for the better? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any simple hard-and-fast rule that makes these decisions easy. You take things case by case, situation by situation, lie by lie. I do think it\u2019s important to constantly revisit these decisions in a rigorous way, guarding in particular against letting ourselves be used for any purpose other than our own journalistic mission. Often, MSNBC is compared to Fox News. People say they watch Fox for the \u201cconservative\u201d perspective and MSNBC for the \u201cliberal\u201d perspective. It\u2019s obviously a flawed argument, given that Rupert Murdoch\u2019s channel operates with no regard for basic truth. But you must hear this argument made. How do you respond to it? I\u2019m hoping our work speaks for itself. Trump and his allies are openly talking about weaponizing the government to seek revenge against critics in media and politics, with some of his extremist allies even talking about jailing their fellow Americans. You\u2019re one of his most notable critics on television. Are you worried that you could be a target? I\u2019m worried about the country broadly if we put someone in power who is openly avowing that he plans to build camps to hold millions of people, and to\u00a0\u201croot out\u201d\u00a0what he\u2019s described in subhuman terms as his\u00a0\u201cenemy from within.\u201d Again, history is helpful here. He\u2019s not joking when he says this stuff, and we\u2019ve seen what happens when people take power proclaiming that kind of agenda. I think there\u2019s a little bit of head-in-the-sand complacency that Trump only intends to go after individual people he has already singled out. Do you really think he plans to stop at well-known liberals? It also seems pretty clear that some people in politics might think they\u2019ll be on the safe side \u2014 that they might even benefit from it \u2014 if they side with Trump. Ask Mike Pence about how that works out in the end. When Trump\u00a0invokes\u00a0the\u00a0Insurrection Act\u00a0to deploy the U.S. military against civilians on his first day in office, do you think he then rescinds the order on day two? For that matter, what convinces you that these massive\u00a0camps\u00a0he\u2019s planning are only for migrants? So, yes, I\u2019m worried about me \u2014 but only as much as I\u2019m worried about all of us. Do you think the news media \u2014 as a whole \u2014 is adequately covering Trump? It\u2019s commonplace, particularly in left-leaning circles, to hear complaints about how Trump is covered by news organizations. And it does seem that, far too often, these institutions could be a lot more clear-eyed when reporting on the extremist nature of the GOP. What is your perspective? Time is short. Our legal system and our system of elections are fully under attack already. And it\u2019s not a single extremist actor or a small faction leading the charge, it\u2019s now a fully joined project of one of the two major parties in the country. I think Americans broadly know that\u2019s happening, but also that they may not necessarily know what to do about it. Responsibly presenting information, in context, about how radical this is can help bring clarity to what\u00a0Jay Rosen\u00a0has\u00a0memorably\u00a0deemed \u201cnot the odds, but the stakes\u201d of the election. I\u2019m not a media critic and so I\u2019ll leave it to others to grade our performance overall. \u00a0But for me, I do find it helpful in a moment like this, to learn about how Americans before us stood up for our democracy when it was challenged. I hope it helps other people as well. Do you believe the truth always wins? I believe that nothing is inevitable. And that the worst and most misguided among us can change for the better. And that everyone can do something to help. If you ever wondered what you would do if you were called upon to help your country, that alarm bell you\u2019ve been hearing is meant for you. Now\u2019s when you give your answer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/media/rachel-maddow-authoritarianism-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_economy_oil-industry-profits-under-biden", "text": "Nearly four years ago, while campaigning in the runup to the last presidential election, Donald Trump warned that President Joe Biden would \u201cdestroy\u201d the oil industry. As Trump and Biden are set once again to face off in a presidential election, Trump has renewed claims that Biden\u2019s agenda has hurt energy producers, promising to hit rewind on Biden\u2019s environmental policies. But the oil and gas industry in the United States has thrived under the current president, even as the Biden administration has touted its efforts to transition away from fossil fuels and towards green energy sources. In the last three and a half years, US oil production \u2014 and oil and gas company profits \u2014 have broken records. The top five US-based oil and gas companies by market cap, according to S&P Global \u2014 ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), ConocoPhillips (CPP), EOG Resources (EOG) and Schlumberger (SLB) \u2014 have raked in more than $250 billion in profits between 2021 and 2023. That\u2019s a 160% jump compared to the first three years of the pro-big-oil Trump administration, according to calculations by CNN. The energy industry\u2019s recent profit windfall underscores the limited influence of any US president \u2014 whether in favor of fossil fuel or not \u2014 in the global oil and gas market. In Biden\u2019s case, many of the dynamics that supercharged oil and gas industry profits during his presidency were not directly related to his administration\u2019s policies: Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, a post-pandemic surge in travel demand and the proliferation of new technology that helped the US significantly increase its production of oil and natural gas all played a role, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service. \u201cOn balance, I think it\u2019s been a really, really good atmosphere for most [oil] companies,\u201d said Kloza. Boon for oil executives and shareholders According to the US Energy Information Administration, the US produced more crude oil than ever in 2023, beating the previous record set in 2019 \u2014 and Investors have been richly rewarded. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE), which tracks the performance of the largest oil and gas companies, is up more than 100% since Biden\u2019s inauguration. The cash-rich industry has not shied away from dealmaking. Last month, oil giant ConocoPhillips said it would acquire rival Marathon Oil in a deal valued at $22.5 billion. That acquisition comes on the heels of ExxonMobil\u2019s $60 billion purchase of Pioneer Natural Resources and Hess shareholders\u2019 approval of a $53 billion sale to Chevron. Over the last several years, big oil companies have used profits to purchase their own stock on the open market, lifting share prices. Notably, Chevron announced plans for a $75 billion buyback last year and Exxon said it would ramp up its annual pace of share repurchases to $20 billion per year. Chevron\u2019s major buyback package drew reproach from the Biden administration. \u201cFor a company that claimed not too long ago that it was \u2018working hard\u2019 to increase oil production, handing out $75 billion to executives and wealthy shareholders sure is an odd way to show it,\u201d said White House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan last year. Shareholders were also paid in the form of dividends. In 2023, ExxonMobil was the third-largest dividend payer in the S&P 500, behind only Microsoft and Apple, according to ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods. Many oil CEOs have also grown their own fortunes during the Biden administration. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth saw his compensation grow 17%, from $22.6 million in 2021 to $26.5 million in 2023. Exxon CEO Woods\u2019 compensation rose an eye-popping 56% in that span, from $23.6 million in 2021 to $36.9 million in 2023. Clean energy push \u2014 and pull In his first term, Trump overturned more than 100 environmental rules and actions put in place by the Obama administration.  In April, Trump allegedly promised oil industry executives that he would reverse some of Biden\u2019s climate policies in exchange for a $1 billion contribution to this reelection campaign, according to an exclusive report from The Washington Post. While climate advocates say Biden\u2019s record regarding the climate crisis and clean energy is mixed, Biden delivered on the largest climate investment in US history\u2014by far the biggest legislative win for the environmental movement since the Clean Air Act. On his first day in the White House, Biden revoked a permit that his predecessor, Trump, had granted to the controversial Keystone XL pipeline and placed a temporary moratorium on oil and gas leasing in the Arctic. \u201cThe era of supporting fossil fuels, even as a temporary bridge to a clean future, is over,\u201d Bob McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group told CNN at the time. Additionally, the Biden administration has taken steps to try to nudge the auto industry away from using gas-powered cars, like rolling out new tailpipe emissions standards and revamping electric vehicle tax credits. Earlier this year, Biden announced a temporary pause on approving several pending liquefied natural gas export projects, saying \u201cThis pause on new LNG approvals sees the climate crisis for what it is: the existential threat of our time.\u201d The energy industry has taken note. This year, members of the oil and gas industry have largely donated to Republican candidates and conservative groups, according to Open Secrets. However, in March, the Biden administration approved\u00a0ConocoPhillips\u2019 massive\u00a0Willow oil drilling project on Alaska\u2019s North Slope, which holds around 600 million barrels of oil, angering climate advocates. Despite his mixed record with oil and gas companies, though, Biden has presided over a historic run for the industry, Kloza said. \u201cThe oil industry in general, and this is true from the wellhead to the refinery to the gas pumps, is much, much more prosperous in the last 10 years than it was in any 10-year period prior,\u201d Kloza said. \u201cIt\u2019s just been a renaissance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/economy/oil-industry-profits-under-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_business_housing-inflation-economy-nightcap", "text": "The numbers are in and the hot takes have been tweeted: Inflation is cooling, the stock market is humming right along, wages keep going up and jobs abound. Blessings upon this economy. But most Americans aren\u2019t exactly ready to pop open the Champagne just yet. We\u2019re still languishing in a \u201cvibecession\u201d of sorts, even as surveys show that people generally feel pretty good about their own personal finances. Despite all the good news, there\u2019s one giant, inescapable reason why people don\u2019t feel like the economy is as good as it actually is. Rent, and housing generally, is still too damn high. See here: The Consumer Price Index came in at 3.3% last month on an annualized basis. Meaning prices on the everyday goods and services you buy are about 3.3% higher on average than they were a year ago. Prices for some items are even going down at some major retailers, after executives realized their customers had enough of their pricing power shenanigans. If you take a look at \u201csupercore\u201d CPI \u2014 the unofficial reading that excludes food, fuel and the cost of renting or owning a home \u2014 the picture is even rosier. Supercore prices were up just 1.9% from a year ago, right in the sweet spot that virtually every central bank in the world is aiming for. Unfortunately, real life doesn\u2019t let us just close our eyes and make the cost of food, gas and rent disappear. Shelter costs \u2014 which include rent and an estimated cost of homeownership \u2014 were up 5.4% from a year ago. That\u2019s a slight improvement from April, and far lower than their peak of 8.2% in March last year. (Before the pandemic, shelter inflation typically rose around 3.5% a year.) \u201cIt\u2019s an 18-wheeler riding its brakes down a mountain. We know where it\u2019s headed, but it\u2019s a slow descent,\u201d said Jay Parsons, an economist and head of investment strategy at Madera Residential, a Texas-based apartment developer. The monthly fluctuations in the CPI are just part of the complex housing puzzle. The CPI doesn\u2019t weigh the cost of buying a home, which is its own separate nightmare at the moment. \u201cThe housing situation is a complicated one,\u201d said Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday, in his typically understated style. \u201cUltimately, the best thing we can do for the housing market is to bring inflation down so we can bring rates down, so that the housing market continues to normalize.\u201d It\u2019s not exactly breaking news but: Housing supply is low, mortgage rates have been hovering around 7% for months, and home prices have continued to rise to all-time highs. All of those factors have coalesced into a sticky market where no one can afford to move and even fewer can afford to buy. And if you are among the lucky ones who manages to find a place you can afford, buckle up, because the costs don\u2019t stop at closing. According to a recent Bankrate study, US homeowners are now paying an average of $18,100 a year on home-related costs beyond the cost of the house; expenses that include property taxes, insurance, maintenance, energy and various other costs. That represents a 26% increase from four years ago, when the average annual cost to maintain a home was $14,400. There are some early signs that the housing market is becoming a bit less stuck. Zillow\u2019s latest market report found that sellers are returning to the market, but they\u2019re finding buyers have lost some enthusiasm. Home sales in May were 6% lower than last year. That has helped partially restock the housing inventory, with the number of homes on the market rising 22% compared to last year\u2019s near record-low level, according to the report. Inventory is still 34% below pre-pandemic norms, but that\u2019s the smallest deficit in more than three years. \u201cHomeowners who may have put off listing their homes are done waiting,\u201d said Orphe Divounguy, Zillow senior economist. At the same time, the one-two punch of inflation and high borrowing costs have discouraged first-time buyers, reducing competition for houses.  \u201cIf these trends hold, we\u2019re likely to see price growth flatten or tick down over the next year,\u201d Divounguy said. Of course, as Powell noted in his speech Wednesday, it may take \u201cyears\u201d for housing inflation to normalize. \u201cThere\u2019s not a silver bullet,\u201d said Douglas Duncan, senior vice president and chief economist for Fannie Mae. \u201cPart of it is access to land near to where people either want to live or must live based on their employment \u2026 There are a lot of little experiments taking place in different places, but no one has discovered a silver bullet yet. And we certainly don\u2019t have that silver bullet.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/business/housing-inflation-economy-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}

Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/14/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_tech_apple-ai-next-big-thing", "text": "Apple just kicked off a brand new era for the company with the introduction of its first generative AI features for the iPhone. At its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, the company unveiled the first batch of tools powered by \u201cApple Intelligence,\u201d from personalized Genmoji \u2013 Apple\u2019s AI-generated emoji \u2013 to a significantly smarter Siri, which can answer questions about your schedule, what\u2019s in your email and what time your loved one\u2019s flight is landing. It also announced a partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI to power the features. Although the partnership will likely give the company a much-needed boost, Apple aligning itself with a company and a technology that have yet to win public trust, facing criticism for taking user inputs and incorporating them into ChatGPT\u2019s data set may cause some challenges down the road. Apple emphasized privacy and security during its presentation, noting most AI functions will be done on the phone, keeping inputs away from a far-off server cloud. A big push into AI could spur growth for iPhone sales and services for years to come, as users are now waiting longer to upgrade their devices and an uncertain economic environment weighs on consumers, particularly in China. The company also faces regulatory scrutiny in Washington and was passed this week by chip maker Nvidia as the second-largest public company in the US. The company said it\u2019s been impressed with the generative AI tools already on the market, but wanted to make it more personal with privacy in mind. \u201cAs we look to build in these incredible new capabilities, we want to ensure that the outcome reflects the principles at the core of our products, it has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the keynote. \u201cIt has to be intuitive and easy to use. It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences.\u201d He added: \u201cMost importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications, and more. And, of course, it has to be built with privacy, from the ground up.\u201d The timing is also noteworthy: Apple is not always first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the most cutting-edge technology. Here\u2019s a closer look at what Apple announced at its big event: AI, AI and more AI Apple is embracing generative AI \u2013 the buzzy form of artificial intelligence that can provide thoughtful and thorough responses to questions \u2013 through Siri, the company\u2019s virtual assistant with a hit-or-miss track record, essentially turning it into an iPhone chatbot. This could enable Siri to perform specific tasks such as recalling a picture taken years ago on the device or answering detailed questions about the weather, the news or trivia. It can also perform more advanced tasks, such as answering when a user\u2019s mom\u2019s plane is landing, by analyzing information previously sent in an email. Over time, it could learn the user\u2019s preferences and respond accordingly. This is not unlike what some competitors have already introduced in generative tools. Siri will also likely adapt automatically and seamlessly to users, based on voice, audio and natural language, along with images and contextual cues. Users will also be able to create personalized photos, such as taking a picture of your mom and making it into a stylized, cartoon-y version, adding a superhero cape. It can take action across apps, including asking the software to pull up all photos of a family member, and retrieve and analyze data from across your apps, such as factoring in what\u2019s on your screen like email or a calendar. If a meeting is being rescheduled, Apple Intelligence can process relevant personal data and see the email your kid sent days before about a recital, alerting users if there may be a conflict. In a Q&A following the keynote, Cook once again said the company is taking privacy and security very seriously with the rollout of the new technology. \u201cWe think AI\u2019s role is not to replace users but to empower them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you think about what\u2019s possible, it has to be integrated with the experience and be intuitive, and informed by your personal context and knowledge of you. If you\u2019re going to do that, there\u2019s a lot of responsibility.\u201d Beyond AI Apple kicked off its iOS 18 portion of the event by highlighting new controls and personalization coming to iOS 18, including a revamped look for all icons when it goes into Dark Mode, a new tint color that compliments wallpaper and a redesigned control center that is available from the lock screen, so you can swap the flashlight icon for other tools. Apple said it is also doubling down on privacy and security, such as giving users the option to \u201clock\u201d certain apps, making them accessible only via Face ID, Touch ID or a user\u2019s passcode. The feature could be especially helpful to protect apps like a banking app, an insurance app, or if you\u2019re handing your phone over to show off photos or get someone\u2019s phone number. Users can now also \u201chide\u201d an app, so it will show up only in a locked, hidden folder. And media from hidden apps won\u2019t show up anywhere else on their phone. Text messages are getting a bump, too. The company said it will soon let people send texts via satellite, even if they don\u2019t have a cell or WiFi connection. Apple is also adding what it called one of the most requested features in iMessage: the ability to schedule messages. IPhone users will now be able to record and create transcripts of calls right from the phone app. All parties to the call will be notified when it is being recorded. Other product updates The company also made software updates to other products, including the Mac, AirPods and Apple Watch. Apple showed off its latest MacOS software called Sequoia, with a handful of new productivity features. Phone mirroring, for example, will bring iPhone alerts directly to the laptop that show up directly next to Mac notifications. MacOS will also support the ability to arrange windows open on screen in certain areas, such as side by side \u2014 a concept popularized by Microsoft Windows. Video conferencing is getting a presenter preview, so users can see what they\u2019re going to share before they share it. Apple is also introducing background replacements on calls, so users can hide the laundry behind them. Meanwhile, AirPods users will be able to answer or decline a call with just a nod or shake of their head. And new vital sign tracking on Apple Watch can notify users when they may be getting sick, based on signals like body temperature and heart rate. Vision Pro update Just a few months after its launch, Apple showed off a few upgrades coming to the software that powers its Vision Pro mixed reality headset. During its most recent earnings call, Cook said more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought an Apple Vision Pro. \u201c[We] are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren\u2019t possible before,\u201d he added. Vision OS 2 promises to offer more rich experiences for users, such as a wider display for work stations, new hand gestures that let you check battery life or open up the home screen, and get deeper inside the photos in your library, thanks to advanced machine learning that provides more natural depth. The company said it is also adding more capability for users to capture spatial videos. Apple is also bringing Vision Pro to more countries, including the UK, China, Japan Singapore and Australia, this summer. Upgrades could also boost sales of the pricey Vision Pro, which starts at $3,499. Demand for Apple\u2019s new headset has\u00a0reportedly\u00a0been weak.

Although last year\u2019s WWDC focused on the unveiling of the Vision Pro mixed reality headset, which launched in stores in February, this year is expected to turn to Apple\u2019s AI efforts. The company is reportedly interested in licensing and building Google\u2019s Gemini AI engine, which includes chatbots and other AI tools, into upcoming iPhones and its iOS 18 features. As more tech companies pour billions of dollars into the development and rollout of artificial intelligence, Apple has largely been left out of the conversation, with many other tech companies making big strides in the space. A partnership with Google would catapult Apple into the growing AI arms race. Apple researchers also recently said they\u2019ve developed a family of multimodal models \u2014 which refers to an AI system that can interpret and generate different types of data, such as text and images at the same time \u2014 called MM1.
