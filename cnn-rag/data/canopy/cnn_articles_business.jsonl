The company had previously warned that achieving its goal of taking the 168-year-old brand further upmarket, to become the definition of \u201cModern British Luxury,\u201d had been harder than expected after demand for luxury had slowed. Sales fell 12% in the final quarter, dragged down by a 19% slump in China, and wiping out gains made earlier in the year, Burberry said Wednesday. It reported operating profit of \u00a3418 million ($526.4 million). Sales in London, its home market, declined 17%, which Chief Executive Jonathan Akeroyd blamed on a lack of tax-free shopping for tourists. \u201cSpending by Chinese tourists at our stores in London is less than half of what it was compared to the pre-pandemic, whereas it\u2019s more than tripled in Paris,\u201d Akeroyd said. Sales in continental Europe rose 8% in the last quarter of 2023. Akeroyd said that, while the financial results underperformed the company\u2019s original expectations, it had made good progress refocusing its brand. The British fashion house has lagged higher-end competitors like\u00a0Hermes\u00a0and\u00a0Prada,\u00a0which have reported increases in sales. However, the sector as a whole is still struggling. Gucci owner\u00a0Kerring, Burberry\u2019s closest rival, saw first-quarter sales decline by 10%. The world\u2019s largest luxury group, Louis Vuitton owner\u00a0LVMH, also reported weak sales in its latest quarter as spending on luxury items slowed. For\u00a0Burberry, the Americas continued to be a weak spot, with comparable store sales down 12% in both the fourth quarter and the whole of 2023. Burberry\u00a0hopes a wider range of products, including classic men\u2019s and womenswear tailoring, with broader pricing will appeal to those top-end customers who continue to spend. Creative director Daniel Lee is key to the brand\u2019s repositioning. He showed his third collection at London Fashion Week in February, which focused on the brand\u2019s outerwear heritage.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/business/burberrys-profit-slumps-by-a-third-as-sales-in-china-plunge/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_business_royal-mail-takeover-daniel-kretinsky", "text": "Royal Mail dates back to the Tudors. It has been operating a postal service in England since the reign of Henry VIII. Now this most British of institutions is on the brink of being sold to a Czech billionaire, Daniel K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd, raising fears about the fate of thousands of workers and a key national service. British logistics company International Distribution Services (IDS), which owns the loss-making postal service, said Wednesday that it was \u201cminded to recommend\u201d to its shareholders a \u00a33.70-per-share ($4.69) takeover offer from K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd\u2019s EP Group. EP Group has until May 29 to convert its \u00a33.5 billion ($4.4 billion) non-biding offer into a formal bid for IDS. The likely sale would come after a difficult few years for Royal Mail, which was privatized in 2013. It has suffered a sharp drop in demand for its services, and losses have ballooned. Appeals to the government to be released from its obligation to deliver letters six days a week have fallen on deaf ears. A spokesperson for the UK Department for Business and Trade told CNN that it had \u201cno current plans\u201d to change Royal Mail\u2019s legally binding service obligations. \u201cAny future changes to Royal Mail\u2019s operation will need to take into account the impacts on businesses and vulnerable consumers who rely on this vital service,\u201d the spokesperson said. So who is the white knight ready to take on a company that, during the last financial year, was losing \u00a38 million ($10 million) a week? The \u2018Czech Sphinx\u2019 K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd is a Czech national who has made his fortune through a sprawling empire of European energy companies, retailers and football clubs. He is worth an estimated $7.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The 49-year-old magnate began his career as a lawyer, before moving to a Czech investment bank, where he became a partner in 2003, according to EP Group\u2019s website. A few years later, K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd co-founded Energetick\u00fd a pr\u016fmyslov\u00fd holding, or EPH, which owns European gas- and coal-fired power plants, commodities trading firms and freight companies, its website shows. In 2016, the billionaire founded EP Group with business partner Patrik Tk\u00e1\u010d. Through its investment arm Vesa Equity Investment, K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd has acquired stakes in big-name brands such as Foot Locker (FL) in the United States, FNAC in France, and supermarket Sainsbury\u2019s in the United Kingdom. He has come to be known as a mysterious personality given his reluctance to speak publicly about his business dealings. So elusive, in fact, that the Polish version of Newsweek magazine dubbed him the \u201cCzech Sphinx\u201d in 2019. The Sphinx, a mythical creature originating in Greek mythology, requires travelers to solve a riddle before allowing them to pass. But some fans of British soccer will already know his name. Three years ago, the businessman bought a 27% stake in West Ham United Football Club through another of his investment firms. That makes K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd the club\u2019s second-biggest shareholder, according its website. \u2018As British as it gets\u2019 The potential buyout of Royal Mail has stirred anxieties about the consequences of the iconic British institution coming under foreign ownership. \u201cAs a rule, we welcome international investment in British companies,\u201d UK finance minister Jeremy Hunt told reporters Friday. \u201cBut we do always look at national security considerations and make sure that, in terms of our core infrastructure, there are no risks to those going forward, and any bid for Royal Mail would go through that normal process.\u201d Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, which represents about 110,000 Royal Mail workers, said the potential takeover by K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd\u2019s investment firm posed a \u201cthreat\u201d to the future of postal services in the UK. He asked that EP Group \u201cimmediately demonstrate\u201d a commitment to working with the CWU and rule out any potential break-up of Royal Mail or diminishment of its workers\u2019 pension pots. \u201cIt cannot be right that a key part of national infrastructure is allowed to be owned by individuals or companies who have no vision for the future and no clear plan to put the workforce at the heart of turning Royal Mail around,\u201d Ward said in a statement Wednesday. Jonathan Reynolds, business spokesperson for the UK\u2019s opposition Labour Party, urged EP Group in a letter to provide \u201ccast-iron guarantees\u201d that it would keep Royal Mail\u2019s headquarters in the UK, and would work closely with its labor union. \u201cRoyal Mail is as British as it gets, and Labour will take the necessary steps to safeguard its undeniable identity and place in public life,\u201d he wrote in the letter, which he posted on X. In a statement last month, EP Group said it was \u201ca committed long-term investor in the UK\u201d and believed that private investment in Royal Mail was \u201ccrucial\u201d as the service faced escalating competition with multinational companies in the UK postal market. \u201cRoyal Mail is an important national asset that would benefit from being able to take a longer-term view,\u201d the firm said. \u201c(EP Group) is prepared to support this iconic business as it transforms and rebuilds into a modern postal operator delivering high-quality service to its customers, stability to its workforce and sustainable financial performance.\u201d Ivana Kottasov\u00e1 contributed reporting.

{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_17_business_boeing-whistleblower-suicide-police-investigation", "text": "Boeing whistleblower John Barnett died by suicide, according to a police report released on Friday, bringing to end an investigation of the shocking death of a longtime employee who raised concerns about the airplane manufacturer\u2019s safety and production standards \u2013 and who sued the company, claiming Boeing illegally retaliated against him. Barnett, 62, was found dead in a vehicle on March 9 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in Charleston, South Carolina. Officers had been dispatched to conduct a welfare check on Barnett at a Holiday Inn when he failed to show up to a deposition in his case against Boeing, according to his lawyers and a police incident report. When they arrived, responding officers found Barnett dead in the driver\u2019s seat of\u00a0a truck in the parking lot. He was holding a handgun. The initial police report also said there was a note in the truck. But Barnett\u2019s lawyers said in a statement following his death that his deposition was nearing an end and he appeared to be in good spirits. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it,\u201d his lawyers, Robert Turkewitz and Brian Knowles, said in a statement on March 12. \u201cThe Charleston police need to investigate this fully and accurately and tell the public what they find out.\u201d The Charleston Police Department on Friday concluded their investigation into Barnett\u2019s death, saying the Charleston County Coroner\u2019s Office determined that Barnett had killed himself. The investigation found that Barnett was shot in the head at close range and the weapon was found in his right hand. There was also a notebook found in the front seat of the car that showed signs that \u201che was going through a period of\u00a0serious personal distress,\u201d according to a media release about the police investigation. Police shared with CNN an image of a note left in the car, which had multiple disparaging messages directed at Boeing. \u201cAs this investigation comes to a close, we should not forget it represents the loss of Mr. Barnett\u2019s life,\u201d police said, \u201cWe extend our deepest sympathies to his family during this difficult time and hope they continue to find the strength to persevere in absence.\u201d Boeing could not immediately be reached for comment. In March, the company said it was saddened by Barnett\u2019s death. \u201cOur thoughts are with his family and friends,\u201d the company said. Accusations of safety lapses Barnett, a former quality manager who had worked at Boeing for decades, told the New York Times in 2019 that he had discovered unsafe wiring clusters in Boeing\u2019s manufacturing processes that, if severed by nearby metal slivers, could have led to the catastrophic failure of an aircraft. \u201cAs a quality manager at Boeing, you\u2019re the last line of defense before a defect makes it out to the flying public,\u201d Barnett told the Times. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I\u2019d put my name on saying it\u2019s safe and airworthy.\u201d In a statement sent to the plant\u2019s employees and provided to CNN at the time, Brad Zaback, a site leader at the plant and general manager of the 787 program, said the Times\u2019 report \u201cpaints a skewed and inaccurate picture of the program and of our team (at the plant).\u201d Zaback, who said the Times declined an invitation to visit the plant, said \u201cquality is the bedrock of who we are,\u201d adding that the plant delivers \u201cthe highest quality airplanes.\u201d Since Barnett\u2019s initial public warnings about Boeing, the company has had several high-profile safety and quality lapses, including the blowout of a door plug on a 737 Max shortly after takeoff in January.

{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}

In a coordinated move, the People\u2019s China of China (PBOC) announced that it will set up a nationwide program to provide 300 billion yuan ($41.5 billion) in loans to fund state purchases of unsold homes. Tao Ling, deputy governor of the central bank, said at a press conference in Beijing that it will encourage commercials banks to support local state-owned enterprises to buy unsold homes and turn them into social housing. The 300 billion yuan provided by the central bank could eventually underpin 500 billion yuan ($69 billion) worth of credit to support such purchases, she estimated. Expectations that Beijing was preparing a plan to have local governments across the country buy millions of unsold homes have successfully buoyed China stocks. Investors have been steadily pouring money back into Chinese shares since last month. China Real Estate Business, a newspaper run by the country\u2019s housing ministry, described the measures as \u201cheavyweight policies\u201d that marked a \u201csignificant historic moment\u201d for the real estate sector.  Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Group, said the move to buy unsold homes was \u201cpositive\u201d for the industry, but that the plan was missing key details such as how much would be funded. \u201cLooking ahead, the key is\u00a0when and at what scale the central government can provide a funding source,\u201d he wrote in a Friday research note. China\u2019s local governments have already racked up $15 trillion in debt, much of it hidden, having borrowed heavily in recent years to cover the cost of pandemic-related spending and infrastructure projects.  Decline in sales, investment Over the past two years, the Chinese authorities have introduced many measures to revive the depressed real estate sector \u2014 to little avail. Analysts have long been calling on them to do much more. Friday\u2019s sweeping rescue measures come as new data suggested the property downturn worsened in April. Government data published Friday showed that property investment declined 9.8% in the first four months of 2024, accelerating from the 9.5% fall recorded in the first quarter. New property sales plunged 28.3% in the January-to-April period, compared with a 27.6% drop in January-March. New home prices\u00a0fell\u00a0for a 10th consecutive month by 0.6% month-on-month in April, the fastest decline since November 2014, according to Reuters. \u201cAll this bad news seems to have finally triggered a sense of urgency that\u2019s strong enough to force material action,\u201d analysts from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale wrote in a note on Friday. The analysts were referring to the government\u2019s announcement, PBOC cuts to mortgage rates and the first batch in the sale of one trillion yuan ($138 billion) of ultra-long Treasury bonds on Friday. On Friday, He also urged local governments to buy back or directly purchase land that has been sold to developers but not yet used. The move would help ease financial difficulties of property companies. In China, land is mostly owned by the state. The government can sell the rights to use the land to property developers, which is a significant source of fiscal revenue. The PBOC also made major additional moves to rescue the housing market. It effectively allowed banks to set their own mortgage rates, removing a nationwide minimum; cut the minimum down-payment ratio for first-time buyers to 15% and 25% for second-home buyers; and lowered the interest rates for housing provident fund loans by 0.25 percentage points, according to three separate statements by the central bank.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/economy/china-rescue-measures-housing-market-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_business_american-airlines-flight-attendants-wages", "text": "America\u2019s cost of living crisis has stung new flight attendants, many of whom haven\u2019t had an opportunity to renegotiate their contracts since the inflation spiral began several years ago. An employment verification letter American Airlines gives to some newly hired flight attendants documenting their salary has been circulating on Reddit, drawing attention to their low wages. The letter states that a new American Airlines flight attendant will have a \u201cprojected annual salary [of] $27,315 per year before incentives and taxes\u201d and concludes, \u201cAny courtesy you can provide would be appreciated.\u201d The union representing American Airlines workers, the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), verified the authenticity of the letter, which is given to potential landlords or for other services where attendants need to verify their employment and income. The union represents 28,000 American Airlines flight attendants, and it is working on their first new contract in five years \u2013 a deal that stretches back before the pandemic and the inflation crisis. American Airlines did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Even as price increases are slowing down, the letter shows how, for some Americans, a little inflation relief isn\u2019t nearly enough. The low wages for starting flight attendants \u2013 a job once seen as glitzy \u2013 underscores how many people are still struggling, despite what on paper looks like a strong economy and job market. This salary is above the federal poverty line of $15,060 for a single-person household. But that\u2019s a national level and doesn\u2019t take into account regional price differences, including in major metro areas where the cost of living can be significantly higher. In some states, such as Massachusetts, new flight attendants would qualify for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, commonly referred to as food stamps. For a single-person household, Massachusetts residents earning less than $30,120 a year are eligible for SNAP benefits. The union says that flight attendants\u2019 low salaries compared to top airline executives is a prime example of \u201ccorporate greed.\u201d New flight attendants at American Airlines start at $27,000 per year. Robert\u00a0Isom, the CEO of American Airlines,\u00a0earned $31.4 million last year \u2014 1,162 times\u00a0more than a new attendant. \u201cWe have flight attendants who are sleeping in their cars,\u201d APFA communications director Paul Hartshorn told CNN. American Airlines flight attendants have not gotten a raise since 2019, and the union is escalating its push for a new contract to raise wages. Flight attendants for United Airlines, Alaska Airlines and other carriers are also pushing for new contracts to raise wages. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the mean annual wage for flight attendants in 2023 was $71,000. While being a flight attendant is a full-time job, many flight attendants only get about 75 hours of hourly pay a month. For many flight attendants, hourly pay basically begins when the plane\u2019s door closes. They do not get paid for the hours they need to be at the airport or on the plane during boarding and deplaning. APFA is proposing a 33% pay increase to top out at $91 an hour during the first year of a new contract and increases of 5%, 4% and 4% for the remaining years of a four-year agreement. The union is also calling for full retroactive pay raises based on how much attendants flew during five years of negotiations. Under federal law, flight attendants cannot go on strike without permission from the government. The law,\u00a0which is known as the Railway Labor Act, requires union members at airlines, among other certain industries, to remain on the job until after federal mediators declare an impasse in talks. But the union is calling on President Joe Biden and congressional leaders to urge the National Mediation Board to allow the union to pursue a potential strike. The National Mediation Board is a federal agency that oversees labor-management relations in the US railroad and airline industries. \u201cAmerican Airlines is not going to come to the table with an economic proposal that meets our needs unless they have the threat of a strike,\u201d Hartshorn said. \u201cManagement needs the threat of a strike to move in the direction we need them to.\u201d Flight attendants at Southwest Airlines last month ratified a new contract that includes pay raises totaling more than 33% over four years. \u201cWe expect to be compensated along the lines of Southwest,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/business/american-airlines-flight-attendants-wages/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_markets_dow-closes-above-40-000", "text": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 40,000 mark Friday for the first time in its 139-year history. The blue-chip index initially crossed the key threshold early Thursday but ended that day lower. Wall Street has been boosted in recent days by renewed hopes of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve that would loosen monetary conditions for consumers and businesses. A report this week from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that inflation has started to ease, potentially paving the way for the central bank to start implementing the rate cut that investors have been expecting since the start of the year. \u201c40,000\u00a0is a great milestone, but end of the day there isn\u2019t much difference between 39,999 and 40k,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, in a note Friday. \u201cStill, this is a great reminder of how far we\u2019ve come. Think about how many people were talking about recessions and bear markets all of last year. Now we are once again back to new highs.\u201d \u201cInvestors who were patient and ignored all the scary headlines were once again rewarded, just as they have been throughout history,\u201d he wrote. All major indexes closed the week higher, but markets were mixed on Friday. The Dow rose 134 points, or 0.3%, to close at a record high of 40,003.59. This is the Dow\u2019s fifth consecutive winning week. The S&P 500 gained 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.1% lower. Crossing 40,000 Crossing the 40,000 level\u00a0doesn\u2019t hold much practical value for investors,\u00a0but it does catch the attention of the public and, some argue, it could help propel that optimistic sentiment beyond Wall Street. \u201cThe Dow 40,000 milestone also shows how resilient the US economy has been, at a time where there was a plethora of calls for a recession,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial, in a recent note to CNN. \u201cThe overarching importance of crossing these big round numbers is that it brings Wall Street news to Main Street, at least for a day. It also serves as an affirmation that corporate earnings are growing, and that investor confidence remains robust,\u201d he said. To many Americans, \u201cthe Dow\u201d simply means the stock market. The index\u2019s small cache of stocks \u2014 ranging from Microsoft to McDonald\u2019s to Chevron \u2014 represents some of the largest companies in the nation and are widely held among retail and institutional investors alike. A look back Here are some important stops along the Dow\u2019s road to 40,000: Dow is formed:\u00a0The first daily close, on May 26, 1896, was 40.94. The Dow did not get off to a good start, plunging 30% to an all-time low of 28.48 by August that year. Dow 100:\u00a0The Dow first closed in triple digits in January 1906. That marked an impressive rally for the average, which had hit an all-time low when Teddy Roosevelt was president. The Federal Reserve would not be created for seven more years. Crash of 1929:\u00a0The Dow fell 38 points on Oct. 28 and 31 more points the next day. That might not sound bad today, but it represented back-to-back declines of 13% and 12% of the Dow\u2019s value. They are still two of the worst one-day percentage declines in the index\u2019s history. Dow 1,000:\u00a0Nov. 14, 1972. Richard Nixon had just won reelection by taking 49 states. The Dow\u2019s components, which had been unchanged for 13 years, included Woolworth, Eastman Kodak and International Nickel. Crash of 1987:\u00a0On Oct. 19, the Dow plunged 508 points, a 23% drop that is still the largest one-day percentage decline in history. A week later it took an 8% plunge. But the damage was short-lived: Within a year, the Dow was back to pre-crash levels. Dow 10,000:\u00a0March 29, 1999. The \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d of the tech bubble was in full swing as the Dow gained 1,000 points in less than a year to hit this benchmark. It gained 1,000 more points in just the next month. A year later, the dot-com stock bubble burst, sending the Dow down nearly 30% by September 2001. Meltdown of 2008-2009:\u00a0The financial crisis caused the Dow to lose about half its value in less than a year, bottoming out to close at 6,547 on March 9, 2009. The worst day was Sept. 29, 2008, when the Dow lost what was then a record 778 points after Congress rejected a $700 billion bank bailout. The bailout was later approved. Dow 15,000:\u00a0May 7, 2013. As the economy continued to recover from the Great Recession, the Dow had one of the current bull market\u2019s strongest periods. It crossed the 15,000 mark and finished the year up 26.5%, marking the best full-year performance of the current bull market. The Dow nearly matched that in 2017, rising 25%. Dow 20,000:\u00a0January 25, 2017. The stock market had enjoyed a nice run starting on the day after the 2016 election, with the Dow gaining nearly 10% as investors looked forward to lower taxes and less regulation under the Trump administration. Dow 25,000:\u00a0Jan. 4, 2018. The passage of the Trump tax cuts, especially the lowering of the corporate tax rate in December 2017, helped feed the quick move between 20,000 and 25,000. Dow 30,000:\u00a0Nov. 24, 2020: Covid sent the stock market plunging in the spring of 2020. But new hopes of a vaccine and the results of the presidential election ended an era of uncertainty on Wall Street, sending the stock market rolling once again.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/markets/dow-closes-above-40-000/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_17_tech_ai-high-school", "text": "At Princeton High School, students are trying to combat the rapid decline of indigenous languages with some unlikely help: a furry, wide-eyed stuffed animal named Che\u2019w. But Che\u2019w isn\u2019t a standard plush toy. He\u2019s a wildly intelligent generative AI robot that speaks Mam, a Mayan language spoken in the western highlands of Guatemala and Mexico and by a small population of the school\u2019s students.\u00a0The language is currently at risk of extinction, according to UNESCO; the students hope Che\u2019w can help change that. At a time when some high schools are restricting the use of AI in the classroom, others, like Princeton High School, are leaning into it. In the short 18 months since the launch of viral chatbot ChatGPT, generative AI has emerged as a revolutionary technology in the field of artificial intelligence. Its capabilities have impressed both users and experts with its ability to perform a range of tasks, from generating creative content, essays and games to conducting mathematical equations, summarizing complicated concepts and more. All that is already reshaping various parts of our lives, including education. But the technology has leaped ahead far faster, in many cases, than schools\u2019 understanding of how to use it. And with new products out this week from Google\u2019s XYZ initiative and OpenAI\u2019s new GPT-4o, many teachers and districts realize they cannot avoid the subject. Dr. Joy Barnes-Johnson, the science administrator for PHS, said the school is \u201ctrying to embrace AI\u201d as much as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s a tool, just like a pencil is technology that helps communication.\u201d She said the school will host an AI summit this summer with its teachers and administrators to have a conversation about how generative AI should or shouldn\u2019t be used in the classroom. \u201cIn the beginning of the school year, we talked about how AI is the world we\u2019re in now and we have a responsibility to prepare kids for the world they will inherit,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea is that it will help people connect and learn, so we [as teachers] have to not be afraid of it.\u201d Proceeding with caution When ChatGPT launched in November 2022, teachers worried that the tool, which can generate convincing responses and essays in response to user prompts, could make it easier for students to cheat on assignments. Some also worried ChatGPT and similar tools could be used to spread inaccurate information. Not long after its launch, New York City public schools became one of the first school districts to ban students and teachers from using ChatGPT on the district\u2019s networks and devices. Other schools reacted similarly in the weeks and months that followed, including the Los Angeles Unified School District and Seattle Public Schools, which blocked access to ChatGPT on their networks. Some of these districts have evolved their policies over time. The LAUSD, for example, has since launched a chatbot named \u201cEd\u201d to act as a student advisor, with the ability to inform parents about information ranging from children\u2019s test results to their school attendance. Many schools also continue to grapple with how to best approach the technology inside the classroom. \u201cThere is acceptance by educators, but we\u2019re still seeing a lot of caution,\u201d said Noel Candelaria, the secretary-treasurer of the National Education Association who is leading the charge around the union\u2019s AI policy. \u201cThe challenge is there isn\u2019t a lot of guidance on the district level, so the concern educators have is that it\u2019s being something done to them, instead of with them.\u201d He added: \u201cThere are also major concerns around data confidentiality and where data is being pulled from.\u201d Candelaria told CNN that educators feel strongly that they want their voice to influence how it can be applied to schools. The NEA is developing a task force with educators across the country to address many of these issues. Beyond generative AI Some high schools around the country are\u00a0trying to teach students how to use other forms of artificial intelligence for a greater good. At one prestigious public school in New York City, Stuyvesant High School, students created an app for the blind that uses artificial intelligence and tactile feedback to help people detect threats and navigate obstacles.  Similarly, at STEM School Highlands Ranch in Colorado, a team of students developed an AI-powered\u00a0wildlife detection system called Project Deer to help cut down on car crashes. Although researchers have tried to combat such accidents before, studies have shown wildlife don\u2019t consistently react to any one stimulus. So the students instead derived an AI-based predictive solution to alert the driver to an imminent threat on the road. Using four $5 infrared detection sensors placed on vehicles, the students developed a system for\u00a0AI to scan the surroundings and emit a high-pitched sound when an animal\u2019s body heat is detected, a signal that may help to scare the animal away. The school, which was the\u00a0Colorado State Winner in Samsung\u2019s annual Solve for Tomorrow competition, said it is partnering with the University of Colorado in Boulder this summer to help boost its success rate. The Solve for Tomorrow contest featured more than 1,000 schools submitting STEM-based solutions to real-world problems. Samsung told CNN there was a \u201cdefinite uptick in\u201d submitted AI-powered innovations this year compared to previous years. Computer science teacher Tylor Chacon told CNN the group\u2019s big vision is to one day have the technology regulated or adopted by the state for greater use. School administration has told teachers to help create rubrics or lesson plans, Chacon told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019ve been encouraged to embrace it and look into ways we can use it to maximize our own job effectiveness and ease the burden on us,\u201d he said. It\u2019s an increasingly common trend among teachers to use AI tools to create assignments, quizzes, polls, videos and interactives for classroom use. Some are even turning to AI tools and platforms \u2014 such as ChatGPT, Writable, Grammarly and EssayGrader \u2014 to assist with grading papers or writing feedback, a practice that is also raising ethical considerations. Saving a language, learning the future Still, as schools continue to weigh the benefits or disadvantages to teaching and using artificial intelligence, some teachers and administrators feel strongly that it\u2019s the future. At Princeton High, a group of about 14 students met during school hours for months to build out Che\u2019w\u2019s conversational capabilities, drawn from artificial intelligence neural networks that are trained to recognize patterns, solve problems and understand words, sentences and phrases from spoken and written language. Che\u2019w, which translates to \u201cstar\u201d in Mam, was trained to understand the language by the students so it can serve as a personal tutor. The robot is also trained to speak Spanish and English. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t lose patience or get sick of talking to them,\u201d said Mark Eastburn, Princeton High School\u2019s science, research and engineering teacher. \u201cIt\u2019s taking [AI] off the screen and putting it onto a physical structure that looks like a friend that can help you do whatever you need to do.\u201d In April, the students were one of the top three National Winners at the Samsung Solve For Tomorrow\u2019s competition. AI is now a part of students\u2019 lives, Eastburn said. \u201cAnd it will be there when they\u2019re in college and also in their careers,\u201d he added, \u201cso they might as well learn and use it in appropriate ways in high school, if not even earlier.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/tech/ai-high-school/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_business_price-gouging-explained", "text": "Emily Miller lucked out. Of the millions of fans \u2014 and bots \u2014 flooding Ticketmaster\u2019s site in hopes of purchasing tickets to Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour, the 22-year-old managed to score $200 floor seats to see the mega pop star perform in Pittsburgh last summer. Now, Miller dreams of seeing Swift perform again when her tour returns to the US later this year. But despite entering 10 accounts to get a code that would give her the chance to buy tickets at face value through Ticketmaster\u2019s presale, she was unsuccessful. On the resale market, nosebleed-seat tickets behind the stage are already listed for thousands of dollars. \u201cPeople are taking advantage of fans and their vulnerability because people like me who have been fans of Taylor for so, so long would do genuinely anything just to be inside that stadium,\u201d Miller, who is currently in an accelerated nursing degree program in Cleveland, told CNN. The resellers are price gouging the fans, she said. The term has been used a lot lately to describe so much more than just hiking gasoline prices during a hurricane. At the core of the increasingly common accusation of price gouging is the sense that the consumer is being exploited. But it\u2019s not as cut and dry as you may think. In fact, economists \u2014 and even President Joe Biden \u2014 can\u2019t agree on a definition of it. But there\u2019s one thing everyone agrees on: Just about everything costs more than it used to a few years ago, a consequence of inflation. Although the pace of price increases has cooled substantially, we\u2019re still paying more. It doesn\u2019t help that prices can rise in seconds thanks to technology, unlike times when hikes would require, for instance, printing new menus. Consumers are taking to social media more to draw attention to times they feel like they are being ripped off. When, in effect, they may more likely be victims of inflation \u2014 or good old supply and demand. Price gouging is in the eye of the bidder Gavin Roberts, chair of Weber State University\u2019s economics department and who studies the effect of anti-price gouging laws, said the laws themselves often don\u2019t define what price gouging is. Biden has been quite vocal about cracking down on price gouging, which he uses interchangeably with \u201ccorporate greed,\u201d both of which he claims are a contributing factor to inflation. At the same time, Biden hasn\u2019t defined what price gouging is and what it isn\u2019t. A White House spokesperson declined to weigh in on that, and instead referred CNN to comments Biden made, including: \u201cTo any corporation that has not brought their prices back down \u2014 even as inflation has come down, even supply chains have been rebuilt \u2014 it\u2019s time to stop the price\u00a0gouging,\u201d Biden said last year. Corporations charging as much as they can, as painful as it may be for consumers, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re necessarily price gouging, said Roberts. In Roberts\u2019 view, price gouging occurs when there\u2019s a scarcity of a good or service, lack of competition and the consumer has very little information about the price they\u2019ll be charged or doesn\u2019t have the ability to shop around for better prices. All that could lead them to be taken advantage of. The best example of this, he said, would be someone going to the emergency room in dire need of care and months later receiving a bill for thousands of dollars. It wouldn\u2019t, in his view, be price gouging if a situation arose during which someone had the only attainable bottle of water and auctioned it off to a crowd of people for the highest possible price. That\u2019s because people had upfront information about how the price was set, he said. Steven Suranovic, an economics professor at George Washington University who has also published research on price gouging, sees it differently. \u201cI define it as the use of market power to secure a higher price than what would occur with free competition,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, Martin Shkreli was a price gouger when he set ridiculously high prices on some pharmaceutical drugs his company controlled.\u201d When Shkreli was CEO of the company formerly known as Turing Pharmaceuticals, the price of the lifesaving drug Daraprim used by AIDS patients was raised from $13.50 a pill to $750 a pill, in 2015, sparking a public outcry. CNN reached out to Shkreli, who was later convicted of securities fraud and conspiracy, over LinkedIn. Shkreli responded to CNN in a message on LinkedIn: \u201cwe dont talk to snitches.\u201d Price gouging or dynamic pricing? Waiting to order an Uber until you make your way to the lobby of a building could cost you 20% more than the price you saw when you first opened the app. That\u2019s the essence of the Uber business model, a practice known as dynamic pricing where there is no fixed rate for how much your ride will cost. Rather, it is tied to the supply of drivers in a given area and the demand for rides. Uber, like its main competitor Lyft, has come under scrutiny for allowing prices to surge at times when public transit is severely disrupted. In some instances, the companies suspended surge pricing temporarily. (Neither company responded to requests for comment.) Surge pricing was in full effect, though, on New Year\u2019s Eve of 2011 when Uber experienced what was then its highest demand in New York City, causing rides to spike above $100. That invited a slew of price gouging accusations. Travis Kalanick, the CEO at the time, later penned a blog post noting, \u201cNobody is required to take an Uber, but having a reliable option is what we\u2019re shooting for. It\u2019s not about gouging.\u201d Suranovic said surge pricing can simply be a product of \u201ca competitive market.\u201d But he acknowledged that sudden price increases are more likely to lead consumers to believe they\u2019re being price gouged and \u201cblame business for profiteering.\u201d \u201cHigher costs due to inflation is a cause of gradual price increases, but I wouldn\u2019t consider that gouging,\u201d he told CNN. Consumer protections Experts in pricing strategy warn that surprise increases can generate a backlash. \u201cPrice gouging is a subjective emotion of a consumer feeling that they are being taken advantage of by an unfairly high price,\u201d said Rafi Mohammed, who founded a pricing strategy consultancy firm called Culture of Profit. \u201cWhen setting a price, managers need to understand and anticipate that their prices will elicit emotional reactions ranging from \u2018that\u2019s cheap\u2019 to \u2018this is unfair.\u2019\u201d To avoid that, his philosophy has been to set prices in a manner that could elicit a response from customers along the lines of \u201cThank you! I looked around at various offerings and determined that your product and price offered me the best value.\u201d That said, if you do believe you\u2019re being price gouged, your state may be able to step in \u2014 as many did during the pandemic, even for goods like toilet paper, by capping prices. (Though Roberts\u2019 research suggests some anti-price gouging laws are to blame if you couldn\u2019t find toilet paper.) Still, Teresa Murray, director of the consumer watchdog division of US PIRG, a nonprofit consumer advocacy research group, wrote in a blog post that \u201cif you aren\u2019t sure whether a product is priced too high, it\u2019s better to report problematic items to the company and your attorney general.\u201d Perhaps state attorneys general should consider a special division dedicated to Swifties, too.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/business/price-gouging-explained/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_tech_voice-actors-ai-lawsuit-lovo", "text": "Voice actor Paul Skye Lehrman took a job in 2020 for which he believed he was providing a set of one-off voice samples. Years later, he says he heard his voice narrating a YouTube video and then on a podcast \u2014 even though he had never recorded either of them. Now, Lehrman, along with fellow voice actor Linnea Sage, is suing AI firm Lovo for allegedly commissioning them for voice projects under false pretenses in order to create and sell AI-generated versions of their voices. The Berkeley, California based tech company advertises AI-generated voice technology to be used in marketing, education and product demos. Lehrman and Sage are suing Lovo and seeking class action status to include other people \u201cwhose voices and/or identities were stolen and used,\u201d according to the complaint filed Thursday in the Southern District Court of New York. The complaint was first reported by the New York Times. The voice actors\u2019 lawsuit is just the latest in a recent string of legal actions brought against various tech companies by creatives, writers and artists who say their work was used without their permission to train AI systems that could ultimately compete with them. Such lawsuits have added to a growing wave of concerns over how the training of AI models, which requires huge swaths of data, could run afoul of copyright and intellectual property laws. \u201cImplicit in LOVO\u2019s offerings to its customers is that each voice-over actor has agreed to LOVO\u2019s terms and conditions for customers to be able to access that actor\u2019s voice,\u201d the complaint states. But for Lehrman and Sage and any others \u201cwho have not agreed to LOVO\u2019s terms, the continued unauthorized use of Plaintiffs\u2019 voices is theft of service and misappropriation.\u201d Lovo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. In May 2020, Lehrman says he received a request for voice-over narrative services on the gig work website Fiverr from an account called \u201cUser25199087.\u201d When he asked what the voice sample was for, he was told it would be used \u201cfor academic research purposes only\u201d and that \u201cthe scripts would not be used for anything else,\u201d according to the complaint. He was paid $1,200 for the job, the complaint states. Two years later, Lehrman came across a YouTube video that sounded as if it had his voice narrating it, although he\u2019d never been involved in its creation, the complaint states. Then in June 2023, Lehrman claims he heard his voice being used on a podcast about the dangers of AI technologies. Similarly, Sage was offered a job on Fiverr in 2019 producing \u201ctest scripts for radio ads\u201d that she was told would \u201cnot be disclosed externally,\u201d according to the complaint. She was paid $400. Sage says she later also discovered her voice in a YouTube video: a recording of a Lovo investor presentation demonstrating its technology. Lehrman and Sage allege that the people who contacted them on Fiverr were Lovo employees who misrepresented what their voice samples would be used for and later sold or raised money on the back of the AI-version of their voices. \u201cTo be clear, the product that customers purchase from LOVO is stolen property. They are voices stolen by LOVO and marketed by LOVO under false pretenses,\u201d the complaint states. The actors are seeking more than $5 million in damages, as well as a court order blocking Lovo from continuing the alleged use of their voices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/tech/voice-actors-ai-lawsuit-lovo/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said.

It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_business_retirement-plan-insurance-annuities", "text": "More Americans are turning 65 this year than ever before, and that number is set to creep even higher over the next few years. It\u2019s fueling a huge rollout of new retirement products \u2014 but they\u2019re not all golden tickets. An average of 11,200 Americans will reach that traditional retirement age each day in 2024, according to a recent report by the Alliance for Lifetime Income. This surge, along with new legislation that took effect recently, has led to a growing number of financial products that promise paychecks for life, no matter how long you live. But some options are difficult to reverse and, since some plans are so new, the benefits and shortfalls have not been thoroughly researched. From pensions to 401(k) plans Although she plans to stop working in about a decade, Jennifer Messina, a 51-year-old administrative assistant in Nutley, New Jersey, said she isn\u2019t worried about retirement because her husband\u2019s job affords them a union-sponsored annuity (an insurance product that pays out income) and a pension plan. With defined benefit pensions, the burden of saving and investing for retirement falls on the employer, not on employees. These plans generally offer employees payments for life, depending on that person\u2019s salary and how long they were with the company. \u201cI\u2019m really fortunate,\u201d Messina said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really save much of anything.\u201d However, jobs offering pension plans are harder to come by compared to previous decades. Over the past 40 years, defined contribution plans, also known as 401(k) plans, have taken their place. Americans currently hold over $7 trillion in 401(k) plans, according to data from the Investment Company Institute, a trade association. These types of retirement plans put the job of saving and investing on the employee. With 401(k) plans, it\u2019s up to retirees to ensure they don\u2019t run out of money. Many people aren\u2019t able to save adequately for retirement so that potentially leaves them heavily reliant on the Social Security benefits they accrued in their working years \u2013 and those benefits aren\u2019t huge. The average retiree\u2019s monthly check this year is $1,915, according to the Social Security Administration. And even retirees with the highest earnings during their careers are getting somewhere between $2,710 and $4,873 depending on the age they are when they retire. In addition, millions of employees don\u2019t have access to a workplace savings plan or don\u2019t participate if they do. Nearly 50% of people don\u2019t have any money saved in a retirement account, according to Federal Reserve data from 2022. \u201cIt is structurally flawed,\u201d Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist and professor at The New School for Social Research, said of the 401(k) system. Financial companies are jumping in to fill the void However, this year has brought some changes to employer-sponsored plans. A new law, known as Secure Act 2.0, allows companies to now offer their employees access to lifetime annuity products in their 401(k)s. Enter financial companies offering new investments that echo the promise of a traditional pension: a paycheck you can count on for life. In April, BlackRock unveiled a new fund offering called LifePath Paycheck, which is a target-date retirement fund, which invests in less risky assets the closer you get to retirement. The new twist: It comes with an option to purchase annuities recommended by BlackRock. People who are in BlackRock\u2019s target date fund and elect to purchase an annuity through their workplace plan are not subject to the typical sales commission fees usually associated with buying an annuity. But they can only be in the fund if they have a managed account within their 401(k) plan and pay a management fee based on their assets. Nationwide is also offering a new target-date fund with an annuity option for 401(k) participants called Income America 5ForLife, although it\u2019s structured differently from BlackRock\u2019s product. By being in the fund you automatically will get annuity payments in retirement and those payments will be based on 5% of your balance when you retire. The product promises to continue paying that amount, even if you outlive the account\u2019s balance. Unlike a traditional annuity, you can pull your money out of the plan without penalty if you no longer wish to receive annuity payments. \u201cThis is a whole new burgeoning segment,\u201d Eric Stevenson, Nationwide\u2019s president of retirement solutions, told CNN. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your father\u2019s annuity.\u201d What are the downsides? Both products can be used with tax-deferred 401k savings or after-tax Roth 401(k) savings. For now, they are only available to employees at companies that offer them and only if they have managed accounts within the workplace savings plan. Ghilarducci cautioned that these products won\u2019t be free. And she advised that, when possible, retirees should opt to manage their savings on their own. \u201cThen you\u2019re not subject to any fees and you\u2019re not paying somebody else\u2019s profits,\u201d she said.  But for retirees looking for a guarantee that they won\u2019t run out of money, some of these new offerings may be appealing. There may be other downsides, however: As with other annuities, the monthly paychecks you get may be smaller if you elect to pass the benefit on to your spouse after you pass away, and annuities generally don\u2019t allow payments to pass on to children without incurring an additional cost. And annuities can be confusing to navigate \u2014 and with many it is difficult to remove your money after you\u2019re locked in. There\u2019s also the issue of inflation. Annuities do not necessarily offer inflation-adjusted payments, which means the value of your guaranteed paycheck will decline over time as you get older. In other words, it\u2019s always buyer beware. A steady paycheck, even one that emulates a traditional pension, might not be a perfect solution. Though she said she\u2019s not worried about her finances after retiring, Messina, the administrative assistant in New Jersey, conceded that she and her husband will likely have to downsize, even with the benefits of a pension and annuity. \u201cEven with the amount of money we\u2019ll be getting, we can\u2019t stay here in New Jersey,\u201d she said. Their next hurdle is deciding where to settle before they retire. Messina wants to relocate to South Carolina, while her husband wants to move to North Dakota.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/business/retirement-plan-insurance-annuities/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications.

According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_business_critical-minerals-shortage-clean-energy", "text": "The world is facing a shortage of the minerals needed to make the electric vehicles, wind turbines, solar panels, and other clean energy technologies essential to ending its reliance on fossil fuels. The Paris-based International Energy Agency said in a report published Friday that steep drops in the prices of lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite last year were \u201cgood news for consumers\u201d but discouraged investment in the mining of those critical minerals. The world is on track meet only 70% of global copper demand and 50% of lithium demand by 2035, the agency added. \u201cThe world\u2019s appetite for technologies such as solar panels, electric cars and batteries is growing fast \u2014 but we cannot satisfy it without reliable and expanding supplies of critical minerals,\u201d Fatih Birol, the IEA\u2019s executive director, said in a statement. Investment in critical minerals mining grew 10% last year, a rate the agency says is \u201chealthy, but slower than in 2022.\u201d The IEA forecast that investors would need to pour $800 billion into mining projects between now and 2040 to stand a chance of limiting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Prices for some critical minerals have returned to their lower pre-pandemic levels, the IEA noted, with those needed to make batteries falling particularly sharply. The price declines were caused by a \u201cstrong increase\u201d in supply that outpaced growth in demand over the past two years, the IEA said. However, \u201ctoday\u2019s well-supplied market may not be a good guide for the future, as demand for critical minerals continues to rise,\u201d it added. Demand for graphite, for example, is projected to quadruple by 2040 from the current level if the world takes steps to avoid warming above 1.5 degrees. The price of lithium cratered 75% in 2023, while prices for cobalt, nickel and graphite plunged between 30% and 45%. Those falls helped drive down the price of batteries by 14%, according to the IEA. Concentration risks Concentration of critical minerals production in a small number of countries increases the risk of shortages, the agency warned. It expects that, between now and 2030, as much as 75% of growth in the supply of lithium, nickel, cobalt, and rare earth elements will come from just a handful of countries. For the types of graphite used in batteries, nearly 95% of supply growth will likely come from China, the IEA said. \u201cThese high levels of supply concentration represent a risk for the speed of energy transitions, as it makes supply chains and routes more vulnerable to disruption, whether from extreme weather, trade disputes or geopolitics,\u201d the agency said. \u201cHigh market concentration means there is a risk of significant shortfalls in supply if, for any reason, supply from the largest producing country is interrupted.\u201d Scientists consider warming of 1.5 degrees a\u00a0threshold\u00a0beyond which extreme heat, floods, droughts, wildfires, and food and water shortages would have catastrophic consequences.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/business/critical-minerals-shortage-clean-energy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, we can confirm that fake voices and images were used,\u201d the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \u201cOur financial stability and business operations were not affected and none of our internal systems were compromised,\u201d the person added. Hong Kong police said in February that during the elaborate scam the employee, a finance worker, was duped into attending a video call with people he believed were the chief financial officer and other members of staff, but all of whom turned out to be deepfake re-creations. The authorities did not name the company or parties involved at the time. According to police, the worker had initially suspected he had received a phishing email from the company\u2019s UK office, as it specified the need for a secret transaction to be carried out. However, the worker put aside his doubts after the video call because other people in attendance had looked and sounded just like colleagues he recognized. He subsequently agreed to send a total of 200 million Hong Kong dollars \u2014 about $25.6 million. The amount was sent across 15 transactions, Hong Kong public broadcaster RTHK reported, citing police. \u201cDeepfake\u201d normally refers to fake videos that have been created using artificial intelligence (AI) and look extremely realistic. Earlier this year, pornographic AI-generated images of pop star\u00a0Taylor Swift\u00a0spread across social media, underscoring the damaging potential posed by AI technology. Attacks \u2018rising sharply\u2019 As a top engineering consulting firm, Arup has 18,500 employees across 34 offices around the world. It was responsible for landmarks such as the Bird\u2019s Nest stadium, site of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. \u201cLike many other businesses around the globe, our operations are subject to regular attacks, including invoice fraud, phishing scams, WhatsApp voice spoofing, and deepfakes. What we have seen is that the number and sophistication of these attacks has been rising sharply in recent months,\u201d Rob Greig, Arup\u2019s global chief information officer, said in the emailed statement. Authorities around the world are growing increasingly concerned about the sophistication of deepfake technology and the nefarious uses it can be put to. In an internal memo seen by CNN, Arup\u2019s East Asia regional chairman, Michael Kwok, said the \u201cfrequency and sophistication of these attacks are rapidly increasing globally, and we all have a duty to stay informed and alert about how to spot different techniques used by scammers.\u201d Kwok returned to the role earlier this month, replacing Andy Lee, who announced his departure from Arup on his LinkedIn page about a week ago after 26 years at the company.

{"id": "2024_05_17_tech_openai-exec-exits-safety-concerns", "text": "A departing OpenAI executive focused on safety is raising concerns about the company on his way out the door. Jan Leike, who resigned from his role leading the company\u2019s \u201csuperalignment\u201d team this week, said in a thread on X Friday that he disagreed with OpenAI leadership\u2019s \u201ccore priorities\u201d and had \u201creached a breaking point.\u201d \u201cAlignment\u201d or \u201csuperalignment\u201d are terms used in the artificial intelligence space to refer to work on training AI systems to operate within human needs and priorities. Leike joined OpenAI in 2021, and last summer the company announced he would co-lead the superalignment team focused on \u201cscientific and technical breakthroughs to steer and control AI systems much smarter than us.\u201d However, Leike said Friday that in recent months the team has been under-resourced and \u201csailing against the wind.\u201d \u201cSometimes we were struggling for compute and it was getting harder and harder to get this crucial research done,\u201d he said on X, adding that Thursday was his last day at the startup. \u201cBuilding smarter-than-human machines is an inherently dangerous endeavor \u2026 But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.\u201d OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Leike\u2019s post saying the company is committed to AI safety. \u201c(I)\u2019m super appreciative of @janleike\u2019s contributions to openai\u2019s alignment research and safety culture, and very sad to see him leave,\u201d Altman said on X. \u201c(H)e\u2019s right we have a lot more to do; we are committed to doing it. (I)\u2019ll have a longer post in the next couple of days.\u201d Leike\u2019s exit, which he announced Wednesday, comes amid a broader leadership shuffle at OpenAI. His resignation followed an announcement on Tuesday by OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, who also helped lead the superalignment team, that he would leave the company. Sutskever said he was leaving to work on a \u201cproject that is very personally meaningful to me.\u201d But his exit was notable given the central role he played in the dramatic firing \u2014 and return \u2014 of Altman last year, when he voted to remove Altman as chief executive and chairman of the board. CNN contributor Kara Swisher\u00a0previously reported that Sutskever had been concerned that Altman was pushing AI technology \u201ctoo far, too fast.\u201d But days after Altman\u2019s ouster, Sutskever had a change of heart: He signed an employee letter calling for the entire board to resign and for Altman to return. Still, questions about how \u2014 and how quickly \u2014 to develop and publicly release AI technology may have continued to cause tension within the company in the months after Altman regained control of the firm. The executive exits come after OpenAI announced this week that it would make its most powerful AI model yet, GPT-4o, available for free to the public through ChatGPT. The technology will make ChatGPT more like a digital personal assistant, capable of real-time spoken conversations. \u201cI believe much more of our bandwidth should be spent getting ready for the next generations of models, on security, monitoring, preparedness, safety, adversarial robustness, (super)alignment, confidentiality, societal impact, and related topics,\u201d Leike wrote in his X thread on Friday. \u201cThese problems are quite hard to get right, and I am concerned we aren\u2019t on a trajectory to get there.\u201d In the wake of Sutskever and Leike\u2019s exits, OpenAI confirmed to CNN that in recent weeks it had begun to dissolve its superalignment team, and instead was integrating members of the team across its various research groups. A spokesperson for the company said that structure would help OpenAI better achieve its superalignment objectives. CNN\u2019s Samantha Delouya contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_18_business_under-armour-kevin-plank-shoes", "text": "It was once hyped as a worthy rival to Nike. But at present, Under Armour, founded by a 23-year-old former college athlete, is struggling  to  \u201cjust do it.\u201d Instead, the brand that\u2019s championed on the basketball court by Stephen Curry and on the golf course by Jordan Spieth, is now struggling \u2014 badly \u2014 to find its footing in an increasingly competitive and crowded sportwear marketplace for regular folks, where younger shoppers are more googly-eyed over newer entrants like Hoka and On running shoes. Under Armour\u2019s annual sales have been sluggish at best for the past several years, while its stock has plunged 88% from its all-time high in 2015. Industry experts said the company is mired in an unpleasant mix of problems, which include an identity crisis, several management controversies, ignoring evolving market trends to its detriment, and a rotating carousel of CEOs in quick succession. One of them is Kevin Plank, its founder, who is back at the helm for a second time as CEO after being replaced in 2019. Similar to Starbucks founder Howard Schultz\u2019s past returns to Starbucks and Disney chief Bob Iger\u2019s recent return as CEO, Plank aims to right the ship at Under Armour. \u201cWhen Under Armour was growing at 20% plus numbers, people saw it as a legitimate competitor to Nike,\u201d said David Swartz, senior equity analyst with research firm Morningstar, in an interview with CNN. \u201cIt was like On or Hoka but 10 years ago. It was the upstart athletic brand that was making real inroads against Nike, the dominant name in the industry. People saw it as a company that actually could break through and take market share from Nike among the hardcore athletes,\u201d Swartz said. \u201cThat actually did happen for a while, but then that didn\u2019t last.\u201d Plank launched Under Armour in 1996 to be what the name suggests \u2014 a protective layer of clothing worn by competitive athletes sweating it out in the heat of the game. The first product was a fitted T-shirt called \u201cThe Shorty,\u201d made from moisture-wicking fabric for elite athletes to wear under their uniforms to keep them dry. Its iconic Under Armour intertwined \u201cU\u201d and \u201cA\u201d logo was strategically placed on the neckline, to keep it conspicuous. The T-shirt eventually launched the brand to the masses after it quickly gained fandom among the ranks of professional athletes. The startup\u2019s fast track to success led to Under Armour going public in 2005. It\u2019s early slogan: \u201cProtect This House.\u201d By 2010, the business had crossed $1 billion in sales. Five years later, sales surpassed $4 billion. But then the momentum started to wane. Protracted period of pain The past eight years for Under Armour have been a struggle that doesn\u2019t appear to be abating. The company on Thursday announced a restructuring of its business as its North America sales in its most recent quarter tumbled 10%. Looking ahead, the company cast a dour forecast for its current fiscal year, expecting sales to drop 15% to 17%. Layoffs will be part of the effort to right the ship but executives did not specify how many employees will lose their jobs. Under Armour also announced a $500 million share buyback, a move to reward shareholders. Plank told analysts during the earnings call on Thursday that he will shepherd a reset of the business that centers on selling fewer but more innovative products to meet the needs of athletes, significantly accelerating product development, refocusing on its men\u2019s apparel category and reducing discounts of its products. \u201cWe are simply doing too much stuff. There are too many products, too many initiatives. To reconstitute this brand, we must be highly focused and prioritize what needs to get done so that our teams know exactly what to do with a clear definition of success for them,\u201d Plank said. It can\u2019t be ignored that management issues, too, have plagued the business for years, Swartz said. \u201cThe company has essentially had five CEOs in the past five years, if you count Kevin Plank twice,\u201d said Swartz. Plank was announced as CEO \u2014 again \u2014 in March, ending the very brief year-long tenure of Stephanie Linnartz. Plank conceded during the analysts call Thursday that frequent C-suite turnover had become a serious impediment to success. \u201cWith several CEOs and heads of product, marketing in North America over the past half-decade, ongoing turnover of critical leadership has been central to our inability to stay agile and decisive,\u201d he said. String of controversies The period from 2016 onward is when \u201cthings really started to fall apart\u201d at Under Armour, Swartz said. A huge issue arose when an important channel of distribution for the brand went bankrupt and closed stores. A bulk of Under Armour products are sold through sporting goods retailers and department stores, including Macy\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s, and online. \u201cWhen Sports Authority went bankrupt in 2016 it really hurt Under Armour. It was a major customer of the brand, as is Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods,\u201d Schwartz said. In 2020, UCLA sued Under Armour for ending a $280 million sponsorship deal. The suit alleged that Under Armour was struggling before Covid-19 and that it used the pandemic as a reason to get out of the deal. The 15-year sponsorship deal, signed in 2016, was the\u00a0largest in the history\u00a0of college sports at the time. In exchange for the $280 million, UCLA\u2019s student athletes and personnel would wear and use Under Armour\u00a0(UA)-supplied products exclusively. The company reached a settlement with UCLA. The following year, Under Armour paid $9 million to settle a multi-year investigation with the US Securities and Exchange Commission into its past accounting practices, according to Footwear News. Outside of other bad press for Plank, competitors were gaining ground on Under Armour, whose high-performance sportwear offerings weren\u2019t best suited for the Lululemon-driven athleisure trend that had emerged and then dominated the way consumers dressed through the pandemic. \u201cUnder Armour has failed to latch upon streetwear, or sports style that catapulted On or Hoka or Merrell,\u201d said Zak Stambor, senior analyst, retail and ecommerce, with market research firm eMarketer, in an interview with CNN. \u201cIt needs to figure out what is next. If it can\u2019t do that, then it needs to quickly latch upon what another brand has identified as the next big thing.\u201d Stambor questioned Plank\u2019s decision to pull back from discounts at a time when consumers are hyper focused on value. \u201cIt carries the risk of decreasing demand particularly when you don\u2019t have a must-have product,\u201d he said. Stambor said this decision also stands in stark contrast to a recent move that rival Adidas has made to roll out cheaper versions of their must-have shoes. Despite it\u2019s significant challenges, Stambor said Under Armour can remain relevant in the market. \u201cIt is a very large company with huge revenue. It\u2019s not as though the brand has fully diminished in standing. It\u2019s a bit stuck,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder Armour needs to identify what it is that consumers want and lean heavily in that direction. It hasn\u2019t fully shown an ability to do so over the past few years,\u201d he said. One area that\u2019s going strong is the brand\u2019s long-term celebrity-brand partnerships, said Eric Smallwood, president of Apex Marketing Group, a sports and entertainment firm that evaluates sponsorships and advertising campaigns. \u201cUnder Armour\u2019s relationship with the \u2018The Rock\u2019, Dwayne Johnson, has been pretty effective. They\u2019ve expanded to the United Football League, which is the football league that Johnson co-owns,\u201d Smallwood said. \u201cTheir uniforms are Under Armour.\u201d Golf is another area where the brand is making inroads while the Stephen Curry partnership has kept the brand visible in the basketball world, Smallwood said. The basketball superstar Curry, arguably the best shooter in history, famously signed with Under Armour instead of Nike in 2013. Meanwhile, the brand\u2019s other major NBA star, Joel Embiid, quit Under Armour in 2023 a few months after he was named the league\u2019s most valuable player. Embiid signed a shoe deal with Skechers last month. Under Armour reportedly bid hard for a shoe deal with WNBA phenom Caitlin Clark, who many expect will sign with Nike. \u201cThe bottomline for Under Armour is for the brand to be clear about its identity,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they a shoe company? Are they an apparel company? At one point everyone else copied their mositure-wicking undershirt. Then maybe they had an identity crisis. It\u2019s going to come down to deciding if they want to evolve into a lifestyle brand or stay in performance-based products.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/business/under-armour-kevin-plank-shoes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}

The A.I. doomsday clock appears ready to strike midnight for publishers. Google\u00a0on Tuesday announced that it will infuse its ubiquitous search engine with its powerful artificial intelligence model,\u00a0Gemini, drawing on the rapidly advancing technology to directly answer user queries at the top of results pages. \u201cGoogle will do the Googling for you,\u201d the company explained. In other words, users will soon no longer have to click on the links displayed in search results to find the information they are seeking. On its surface that might sound convenient, but for news publishers \u2014 many of whom are already struggling with steep traffic declines \u2014 the revamped search experience will likely cause an even\u00a0further\u00a0decrease in audience, potentially starving them of readers and revenue. Why spend time clicking on a link when Google has already scoured the internet and harvested the relevant information with its A.I.? \u201cGoogle will take care of the legwork,\u201d executives said. But a lot of that legwork, of course, comes in the form of human-written articles and expertise published across the internet on blogs and media outlets, all built on a foundation of advertising support. Google\u2019s message was heard loud and clear. Within hours of the Mountain View announcement, the news industry began sounding the alarm. \u201cThis will be catastrophic to our traffic, as marketed by Google to further satisfy user queries, leaving even less incentive to click through so that we can monetize our content,\u201d\u00a0Danielle Coffey, the chief executive of the\u00a0News/Media Alliance, bluntly told CNN. Coffey, whose organization represents more than 2,000 news publishers and has taken an aggressive posture toward A.I. developers\u2019 use of journalism, added: \u201cThe little traffic we get today will be further diminished, and with a dominant search engine that\u2019s cementing its market power, we once again have to adhere to their terms. This time with a product that directly competes with our content, using our content to fuel it. This is a perverse twist on \u2018innovation.\u2019\u201d The announcement from Google, which newsrooms had expected and expressed worry over in both public and private forums in recent months, is poised to further batter an industry that has been dealt a series of brutal blows \u2014\u00a0much of it at the hands of Big Tech\u00a0\u2014 over the last several years. It also comes as\u00a0OpenAI\u00a0reportedly readies to launch its own A.I.-powered search engine. Since\u00a0ChatGPT\u00a0crashed onto the scene more than a year ago, showcasing the potential power of A.I. for the public and setting off an arms race with Google,\u00a0Meta\u00a0and others, publishers have worried greatly about the impact the technology will ultimately have on their businesses. But they have had little time to plan their responses to the transformative technology, given the breakneck pace in which it has developed. Some newsrooms have chosen to cautiously lock arms with the technology giants, striking deals with OpenAI to license their deep archives of content. Others have taken a much different path, with\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0most notably filing a scorched Earth lawsuit against the ChatGPT creator. While publishers once worked hand-in hand with Big Tech companies (remember those days?), their relationships have soured tremendously in recent years.\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg\u00a0most publicly turned his back on the news industry, deprioritizing news articles on his platforms and shutting off other initiatives his company once championed. Google has maintained a better relationship with publishers but also faced sharp criticism. Most recently, it\u00a0drew scorn\u00a0after temporarily blocking some California news outlets from search results in response to a bill that would force it to pay publishers. On Tuesday, likely predicting the panic that its announcement would stir, Google argued that the A.I. changes would actually benefit news companies. Google told CNN it is showing more links with its AI Overviews feature and that by improving the search product, it will allow the company to send more traffic to web publishers. \u201cWe see that the links included in AI Overviews get more clicks than if the page had appeared as a traditional web listing for that query,\u201d Google said in its announcement. \u201cAs we expand this experience, we\u2019ll continue to focus on sending valuable traffic to publishers and creators.\u201d But given Silicon Valley\u2019s track record with publishers, it\u2019s unlikely that the statement will give them much relief. And already there is skepticism over Google\u2019s claims. \u201cOur initial analysis suggests it will significantly reduce search traffic to content creators\u2019 websites, directly impacting their ad revenue and, by extension, their livelihoods,\u201d\u00a0Marc McCollum, chief innovation officer at\u00a0Raptive, which provides services to thousands of only creators and businesses,\u00a0said in a statement. \u201cThis change could put the future of the open internet in danger.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/media/google-gemini-ai-search-news-outlet-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_economy_us-retail-sales-april", "text": "US consumers could be reaching their breaking point. After dealing with elevated inflation and the highest interest rates in decades, they\u2019re starting to rein in their spending. Last month, retail sales were unchanged from March, when spending increased by a downwardly revised 0.6%, the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday. April spending missed the 0.4% increase that economists had projected, according to FactSet. The figures are adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation. By comparison, a year ago, retail sales surged by 3%. Stripping away auto sales, April retail sales were up by 0.2% last month, matching economists\u2019 expectations. By sector, the biggest monthly increase in spending was at gas stations, where sales were up 3.1% in April compared to March. That\u2019s likely a result of surging gas prices experienced in the previous two months. However, they\u2019ve started to cool in recent weeks. Spending was also higher at clothing and accessory stores (+1.6%), food and beverage stores (+0.8%) as well as at restaurants and bars (+0.2%). Almost all other sectors saw monthly declines in spending. The biggest decline was online retail sales, which fell by 1.2% last month. That\u2019s a significant development given online sales have been a bright spot in prior months. Separately, new inflation figures released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed some improvement. The nation\u2019s annual inflation rate eased from 3.5% in March to 3.4% in April, in line with expectations. That came after March\u2019s unexpected jump in inflation. Both pieces of data are welcome news for Federal Reserve officials: Central bankers have been looking for signs that inflation will return back to the Fed\u2019s 2% target. Financially stressed consumers are ushering in an economic slowdown Wednesday\u2019s retail report is another piece of evidence that the economy is slowing. That\u2019s good in the sense that it doesn\u2019t give retailers the ability to pass along higher prices to consumers if they aren\u2019t willing to accept them, which had previously been the case. \u201cBut if that transitions into a deeper slowdown it could herald some economic problems that markets would not welcome,\u201d Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in a note on Wednesday. For the time being though, she said the retail sales report gives the Fed more of a reason to ponder cutting interest rates at upcoming meetings. Many economists now feel that the Fed could cut interest rates as soon as September. The much weaker-than-expected retail sales data comes as the nation\u2019s unemployment rate ticked up last month to 3.9% as the pace of hiring slowed. Also, the number of people applying for first-time unemployment benefits recently rose to the highest level since August. The weakening labor market is causing consumers to act with \u201cmore prudence,\u201d EY senior economist Lydia Boussour said in a note Wednesday. Consumers are also taking on a lot more debt to support their spending but increasingly aren\u2019t making payments on time, according to data released earlier this week by the New York Fed. Notably, the percentage of credit card balances in serious delinquency (90 days or more late) climbed to its highest level since 2012.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/economy/us-retail-sales-april/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_business_uaw-mercedes-benz-rejected", "text": "Autoworkers at a Mercedes Benz plant in Alabama voted against joining the United Auto Workers union Friday, potentially stalling hopes of a rapidly growing organizing wave for autoworkers in the southern United States. The result was a close outcome. Out of the valid votes counted, 56% of workers voted \u201cno,\u201d while 44% voted \u201cyes\u201d for unionization, according to Mercedes-Benz. The National Labor Relations Board said Friday there were more than 5,000 eligible voters. The UAW was hoping to carry its strong momentum with the Alabama vote, as its decision to use a\u00a0\u201cstand up strike\u201d strategy,\u00a0hitting the Big Three automakers all at once, brought unprecedented attention and record contracts for workers. And last month, it won a union election at a\u00a0Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, its first victory in three attempts to organize the factory. Under relatively new UAW president Shawn Fain, the UAW had shifted its strategy for a membership push in non-unionized factories, many of which are located in the American South. In a March interview with Car and Driver, Fain said the profit margins for the Japanese, Korean and German automakers\u00a0were \u201cobscenely more gross than they were at the Big Three, and yet their workers get less.\u201d \u201cI truly believe we\u2019re going to see a huge shift this year. I think we\u2019re gonna win in the South,\u201d\u00a0he said in the interview. In a press conference Friday, however, Fain said that losses are part of the process and that the union will \u201ccarry on and keep on fighting.\u201d \u201cNot the result we wanted today, but I\u2019m very proud of these workers. We keep our heads up and we march on,\u201d Fain said. In an emailed statement Friday, Fain said the Alabama workers \u201cwon serious gains in this campaign.\u201d Fain said they raised wages with the \u201cUAW bump,\u201d which is when non-union companies gave non-unionized employees raises to compete with union contracts. Mercedes-Benz also named a new Alabama CEO ahead of the election. Fain said Mercedes encouraged workers to give the new CEO a chance before elections. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what Volkswagen told its workers in 2019. And in 2024, Volkswagen workers realized it\u2019s not about a CEO. It\u2019s about a voice on the job, it\u2019s about getting our lives back, and getting our time back. The only path to do that is through a union contract,\u201d he wrote. In a statement, Mercedes-Benz US International said that \u201cour goal throughout this process was to ensure every eligible Team Member had the opportunity to participate in a fair election.\u201d \u201cAt MBUSI, our primary focus is always to provide a safe and supportive work environment for our Team Members, so they can build superior vehicles for the world. We look forward to continuing to work directly with our Team Members to ensure MBUSI is not only their employer of choice, but a place they would recommend to friends and family,\u201d the statement continued. Workers faced pressure Six southern governors from Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas issued\u00a0a joint statement in April discouraging the union campaign, warning it could put workers\u2019 jobs, as well as the auto industry in the South, in jeopardy. The statement came a day before workers at Volkswagen voted on joining the UAW. \u201cThe reality is companies have choices when it comes to where to invest and bring jobs and opportunity. We have worked tirelessly on behalf of our constituents to bring good-paying jobs to our states. These jobs have become part of the fabric of the automotive manufacturing industry,\u201d the statement\u00a0said. In a statement Friday, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said that \u201cautomotive manufacturing is one of Alabama\u2019s crown jewel industries\u201d and that the state is \u201ccommitted to keeping it that way.\u201d \u201cThe workers in Vance have spoken, and they have spoken clearly! Alabama is not Michigan, and we are not the Sweet Home to the UAW,\u201d Ivey said in the statement. Mercedes allegedly pushed back against unionization efforts in other ways, according to the UAW. The National Labor Relations Board said it is investigating six unfair labor practice allegations filed by the UAW against Mercedes-Benz since March. Those accusations from the UAW allege Mercedes disciplined employees for discussing unionization during work, prohibited distribution of union materials, surveilled employees, and forced employees to attend \u201ccaptive audience meetings,\u201d which is a mandatory meeting during work hours meant to discourage unionizing. Mercedes-Benz US International denied these claims, and said in a statement it \u201chas not interfered with or retaliated against any Team Member in their right to pursue union representation.\u201d It continued, \u201cWe do not believe these claims have merit and we look forward to presenting our case to the NLRB.\u201d Organizing the South The UAW\u00a0said it began an effort to organize workers at 13 non-union auto US factories in November 2023. The effort included three US-based electric vehicle makers \u2014 Tesla, Rivian and Lucid \u2014 as well as 10 foreign automakers that build cars in the US \u2014 BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Mercedes, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Volvo. The South has been an attractive region for foreign automakers to open plants because of generous tax breaks and cheaper, non-union labor that generally doesn\u2019t receive the wages or benefits won by unionized workers. But last month, hourly workers at Volkswagen\u2019s plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, overwhelmingly voted to join the UAW \u2014 73% of the 3,600 workers at the plant who cast ballots had voted to join the union. The Chattanooga victory didn\u2019t come easy for the UAW. Volkswagen didn\u2019t win until its third union drive, said Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at\u00a0Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations\u2019 Buffalo office. This was the Mercedes plant\u2019s first strong push, and labor experts say a loss at Mercedes isn\u2019t the end of the push to organize the South. \u201cIt\u2019s not a catastrophe if they don\u2019t win (the first time). Primarily because they\u2019re facing a very active Mercedes Benz trying to block them from organizing, you got governors in the South trying to block them from organizing, and they don\u2019t have the same track record or history or infrastructure in Alabama,\u201d Wheaton said to CNN earlier this week. In a press conference Friday, Fain said the difference between Mercedes and Volkswagen was that \u201cVolkswagen was more neutral.\u201d \u201cUntil we can have an absolute, neutral, free and fair election\u2026 This is the fight we have to take on,\u201d Fain said. There are about 150,000 workers at nonunion auto plants in the United States today. That\u2019s roughly the same amount of workers represented at the Big Three. Since 1990, the South\u2019s share of auto jobs has doubled from around 15% to 30% today, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Meanwhile, the Midwest\u2019s share has declined from 60% to 45%. \u201cIt\u2019s not horrible if they lose, because it gives the UAW\u00a0the chance to see where they\u2019re at. They can gauge how much support they have,\u201d Wheaton said. This story has been updated with additional developments and context. - CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore and Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_15_tech_tiktok-frank-mccourt-bid-creator-lawsuit", "text": "Another wealthy investor says he\u2019s organizing a bid to purchase TikTok, after President Joe Biden signed a law last month forcing TikTok to find a new owner or be banned in the United States. Frank McCourt, a real estate billionaire and the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, said Wednesday he is laying the groundwork to acquire TikTok as part of a broad initiative to make a healthier internet. McCourt, who has spent years accusing technology giants of exploiting their users and undermining the internet\u2019s original open vision, did not disclose how much he aims to spend on TikTok or how much he believes the platform is worth. Nor did he address how he plans to deal with the Chinese government\u2019s expected opposition to a forced sale, which would likely trigger export controls China has imposed on TikTok\u2019s\u00a0secretive recommendation algorithm. Still, McCourt said, the potential opportunity to acquire TikTok is a chance to rewire how social media works. Under McCourt\u2019s proposal, TikTok would operate on an open-source, decentralized protocol where users control their own data no matter what social media app they use. \u201cWe can, and must, do more to safeguard the health and well-being of our children, families, democracy and society,\u201d McCourt said in a statement. \u201cWe believe we can preserve \u2014 and enhance \u2014 the TikTok experience by giving individuals and creators on the platform the value and control they deserve regarding who has access to their data and how it is used.\u201d McCourt said he is working with the investment firm Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis to help assemble the bid, adding that the push is backed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. McCourt joins a host of other would-be suitors angling to pick up a platform used by 170 million Americans. Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced in March he\u2019s assembling a bid, as well as Kevin O\u2019Leary, the Canadian chairman of the private venture capital firm O\u2019Leary Ventures. TikTok, meanwhile, has indicated that it\u2019s not for sale and the company has instead begun to mount a fight against the new law. The company sued to block the law earlier this month, saying that spinning off from its Chinese parent company is not feasible and that the legislation would lead to a ban of the app in the United States starting in January of next year. TikTok\u2019s lawsuit claims\u00a0the US government \u201chas taken the unprecedented step of expressly singling out and banning\u201d the short-form video app in an unconstitutional exercise of congressional power that would affect both the platform and its American users. A group of eight TikTok creators on Tuesday also filed a separate lawsuit challenging the potential ban. Their suit calls the law an \u201cextraordinary restraint on speech that violates the First Amendment\u201d and alleged that the law \u201cpromises to shutter a discrete medium of communication that has become part of American life.\u201d The group includes a college football coach; a rancher and former US marine; and a small business owner who runs a line of skincare products, among others, who collectively claim approximately 14 million followers on TikTok. Several of the creators claim they could lose money earned through TikTok\u2019s Creator Fund or by promoting their small businesses if the app were banned, and that their attempts to use other platforms have proven less fruitful. \u201cAs Americans, we should be able to pick whatever apps we use and the government shouldn\u2019t have the power to take that freedom away from us haphazardly,\u201d one of the creators involved in the suit, Topher Townsend, said in a statement. \u201cTikTok contributes significantly to my income and allowed the opportunity to be a full-time creator for almost four years now \u2026 This (new law) is being driven by larger politics, but the end result is going to harm a lot of people, including me.\u201d TikTok declined to comment on the creator lawsuit. The US Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/tech/tiktok-frank-mccourt-bid-creator-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_success_college-tuition-payment-options", "text": "The good news is your child got into college and is preparing to enroll this fall. The bad news is that you\u2019ve just learned the aid package your child\u2019s school is offering is much smaller than you\u2019d hoped. That means your share of the total cost of college may be larger than what you have at the ready. The gap for some parents and students can be much worse if you consider top schools in New England, where the annual sticker price before aid is now $90,000 or more. The total average annual cost came to $60,420 at private four-year colleges in 2023, according to the College Board. After accounting for the average aid offer to offset tuition costs, students and their parents were still on the hook to pay an average of nearly $35,000. But even when students enroll in less expensive public universities, for any parent who doesn\u2019t have a fat 529 college savings and investment plan, or any at all, it\u2019s sobering to realize that in the next few months you\u2019re going to have to come up with a lot more money than you were expecting. Exactly how to do that is the question. \u201cThere is no magic bullet,\u201d said Beth Walker, founder of the Center for College Planning Solutions and author of \u201cNever Pay Retail for College.\u201d But here are some suggestions that may help, or at least buy you a little time to figure out how to handle all the education expenses coming due in the next four years \u2014 or longer, if you have younger kids who are also planning to go to college. Your child may have to borrow money. Try not to feel guilty If you never wanted your children to be saddled with debt before graduating from college, you might rethink that. Freshmen can take out a $5,500 federal Stafford loan at a relatively favorable interest rate. The rate for the 2024-2025 school year will be 6.53%.  Over four years of college, students can take out a total of up to $27,000. What\u2019s more, they don\u2019t have to pay the money back while they\u2019re in school, and they can get a favorable income-driven repayment plan after graduating. \u201cIt\u2019s their best financing tool available,\u201d Walker said. If it really pains you to see them assume debt, remember you can plan now to help them pay it off once they\u2019ve graduated, she noted. Other borrowing options Beyond Stafford loans, there are other borrowing options, but they all come with big caveats: Private student loans: Some students may also take out a private student loan, which doesn\u2019t provide any of the flexible repayment protections they have with federal loans, and could come with a much higher interest rate. But if your child doesn\u2019t have a credit history, you will need to cosign the loan. So you should think about whether you can assume the risks of repaying that money if your child can\u2019t pay it off, especially if the loan you choose doesn\u2019t allow you to defer payment until your child graduates. Parental loans: Parents can also take out a federal Direct PLUS loan. But Joseph Bogardus, a certified financial planner who specializes in college cost planning, is not a big fan because of its high fees (over 4% of the loan amount), the fact that there is no real break on the interest rate (it will be 9.08% for school year 2024-2025) and parents may have to start repaying it while the student is in school, unless they request a deferment. As he put it, \u201cIf you can\u2019t afford to pay $500 a month now, what makes you think you\u2019ll be able to pay $1,000 a month later?\u201d Your 401(k): Taking a withdrawal from your retirement savings may be tempting, but it\u2019s never a great idea. No one is going to fund your retirement if you don\u2019t. But if you are thinking of using some retirement money, make sure to first directly roll over the amount from your 401(k) into an IRA. You will have to pay income taxes on the money, but if you\u2019re under 59-1/2 you will not be hit with a 10% early withdrawal penalty in an IRA if you use the money for qualified educational expenses, Bogardus said. Your credit card: A bad idea. Skip to the next options. The average credit card rate is north of 20%.\u00a0And if you can\u2019t pay off a large sum right away or you can only make the minimum payments due every month, you risk never getting out of that debt cycle. Home equity line of credit: If you\u2019re in a real pinch for your child\u2019s freshman year, and you have substantial equity in your home, Walker said, you might consider an interest-only home equity line of credit as a short-term cash-flow option. \u201cThat\u2019s cash-flow friendly while your child is in college,\u201d Walker said. \u201cYou\u2019re renting money on the cheap to buy time to figure out how you\u2019ll do this.\u201d So, say you take out a $20,000 interest-only HELOC at 8%. That means you\u2019ll only have to pay roughly $133 a month in interest, or $1,600 for the year. You will, however, have to pay the principal back after a given term \u2014 typically 10 years. And if you can\u2019t do so in full, you will have to pay interest and principal on the remaining balance until it\u2019s paid off. Redirect current spending and savings Even smaller measures can help somewhat in closing the funding gap if you\u2019re looking to raise some cash between now and the fall. Quantify how much a teenager at home costs: Walker said parents often overlook the expense of having their children under the same roof. She recommends evaluating how much your college-bound student costs you while they are at home. Think food, gas, entertainment, incidentals, etc. That\u2019s money you\u2019ll be able to redirect toward college costs when they leave home. Redirect discretionary income to savings: During the few months before the bill for the first semester comes due, temporarily cut back on your discretionary spending (e.g., travel and entertainment) and redirect that money into a high-yield savings account. Temporarily pause or reduce some retirement contributions: It\u2019s not optimal, but if you feel you\u2019re doing okay in terms of your retirement savings, you might temporarily redirect the money from your paycheck that would have gone into your 401(k) or IRA for the next three months and put it into the college kitty instead. But, Bogardus cautioned, \u201cYou don\u2019t want it to be a crutch. Think of the oxygen mask analogy: When doing this, parents should be in a good position first for their own future, then concern themselves with their student\u2019s college costs.\u201d Be honest about what you can afford College is among the biggest financial investments parents and their children will ever make. Ideally, key questions like \u201cHow much can we afford?\u201d should be raised no later than when your child is a sophomore in high school, at which point you can better set expectations of the kind of school you (and they) can afford, Walker said. So if you find yourself in a bind with your first-born this summer, you can at least be better prepared when your second child starts thinking about college. You both should take a hard look at different colleges\u2019 costs, Walker suggested, and ask: Is a Bachelor\u2019s degree from a school that costs two to three times as much as another really going to be worth two to three times as much when the child graduates? Also, Bogardus suggests checking to see if your state offers a tuition aid plan or subsidized loan rates for educational expenses. For instance, he said, see if your state has a program that offers a year or two of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to the state university from which your child could earn their degree.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/success/college-tuition-payment-options/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. It\u2019s not just meme stocks that saw a resurgence this week. Beaten-down clean energy stocks have rallied this week. The iShares Global Clean Energy exchange-traded fund, which tracks sectors from renewable electricity to semiconductors to solar energy, has gained roughly 3%. Plug Power shares have climbed 33%, Enphase Energy shares have gained 8% and NextEra Energy shares have added 4%. Behind the rally? President Joe Biden is raising tariffs on $18 billion in Chinese imports across sectors including steel and aluminum, electric vehicles, solar cells and medical products. The new rates range from 100% on electric vehicles to 50% on solar components to 25% for the other sectors, reports CNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche. \u201cChina can\u2019t be the only country that produces clean technology for the world we need,\u201d a senior Biden administration official said. \u201cWe need diversified, not concentrated, production of our most critical goods and technologies. \u2026 That\u2019s the kind of dynamic we think will produce resilient supply chains and clean technology.\u201d Clean energy stocks were battered last year by supply chain snarls and sky-high interest rates, which drove up borrowing costs for growing companies trying to load up on capital. Hopes that an influx of US government spending on climate solutions would help revive the sector didn\u2019t pan out, either. Higher rates also tend to make it more difficult for consumers to transition to using clean energy, since sources like a residential solar system can cost thousands of dollars and require a loan. While some investors hoped that the Federal Reserve would begin cutting rates this year, the central bank has continued to hold rates at a 23-year high. Some investors warn that though the tariffs could continue boosting clean energy stocks, the recent rally isn\u2019t driven by just improving fundamentals. The surge is also in part due to traders\u2019 willingness to take on more risk in their portfolios as stocks continue notching record highs, they say. \u201cThe investment thesis post-tariffs in the sector is better than it was before. But that doesn\u2019t mean that all these companies are out of the woods,\u201d\u00a0Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told CNN. Wall Street\u2019s large risk appetite was in full force this week. Shares of meme stocks such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment have swung wildly after the Roaring Kitty X account run by Keith Gill, a trader who helped spawn the 2021 meme stock frenzy, posted for the first time in three years. Meme stocks are shares of companies that tend to see wide swings based on their popularity on social media rather than their fundamentals. Dow briefly tops 40,000 for first time but ends the day lower The Dow Jones Industrial Average broke past the 40,000 threshold Thursday for the first time ever, fueled by an encouraging inflation report, reports my colleague Nicole Goodkind. The blue-chip index briefly crossed the key threshold in morning trading before falling back below the line in the afternoon to close at 39,869, down 38 points, or 0.1%. All three major indexes closed lower on Thursday. The S&P 500 ended the day down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.3% lower. Markets had rallied to new record highs Wednesday after the latest Consumer Price Index showed a cooldown for the first time in months, stoking hopes that the Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates as soon as September. On a monthly basis, the inflation report showed that prices rose 0.3%, a slower pace than in the two months prior, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists were expecting a 0.4% monthly increase, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Another key data point added to the enthusiasm: April retail sales came in significantly weaker than expected, indicating that consumers are pulling back on the spending that drives the economy. Spending missed the 0.4% increase that economists had projected. \u201cThis is the first good CPI report in four months and the market likes it,\u201d said Gary Pzegeo, head of fixed income at CIBC Private Wealth US. \u201cTaken [together with retail sales] this supports a Fed rate cut in the fall. Markets are discounting a cut in September and have moved to price in a second cut by December.\u201d Read more here. Damaging hacks expose the weak underbelly of America\u2019s health care system A pair of recent ransomware attacks crippled computer systems at two major American health care firms, disrupting patient care and exposing fundamental weaknesses in the US health care system\u2019s defenses against hackers, reports my colleague Sean Lyngaas. In both cases, federal officials and private cyber experts scrambled to try to limit the damage and get computers back online. But the cascading effects from the hacks, with ambulances diverted from hospitals and pharmacies unable to process insurance, has underscored for some US lawmakers, senior Biden administration officials and policy experts that the health care system is ill-prepared for the ripple effects of a cyberattack and needs new security regulations. Health care lags other industries, such as big financial institutions and energy providers, when it comes to IT security, according to some experts. \u201cIndustry has successfully demanded voluntary cybersecurity for years \u2014 and this is what we get,\u201d Joshua Corman, a cybersecurity expert who has focused on the health sector for years, told CNN. Sen. Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who chairs the finance committee, told CNN that \u201cevery new devastating hack hammers home the need for mandatory cybersecurity standards in the health care sector, particularly when it comes to the largest companies that millions of patients depend on for care and medicine.\u201d Without action, the senator said, \u201cpatients\u2019 access to care and their personal health information will be compromised and ransomed by hackers over and over again.\u201d Read more here.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/investing/premarket-stocks-trading-clean-energy-biden-tariff/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_business_gen-z-credit-card-users", "text": "Ariel Barnes plunged into a credit card debt spiral in college, and a decade later she\u2019s yet to escape. Barnes has maxed out seven credit cards and is struggling to make minimum payments on $30,000 of credit card debt. \u201cThe interest is so high that it\u2019s hard to get out of it,\u201d Barnes, who is 28 years old and lives in Jackson, Mississippi, told CNN in a phone interview on Thursday. Barnes is hardly alone. Roughly one in seven (15.3%) Gen Z credit card borrowers have maxed out their credit cards, according to\u00a0new research\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. (The NY Fed defined Gen Z as borrowers born between 1995 and 2011, though\u00a0others mark the cut off\u00a0as 1996 or 1997). By comparison, just 4.8% of Baby Boomer borrowers and 9.6% of Gen Xers have maxed out their credit cards, which can be a sign of a severely tight cash-flow problem. The findings underscore starkly different conditions masked by national economic statistics. Barnes blames bad financial decisions when she was in college for her current situation, which has forced her to live at home and delay major life events. \u201cI want children. The clock is ticking. But I can\u2019t afford to have any children,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had to go to therapy because it is a lot mentally.\u201d More and more Americans of all ages are falling behind on their bills \u2014 especially credit card bills. The NY Fed found that for all debt outside of student loans, delinquency rates have been steadily rising since tumbling to historic lows during the Covid-19 pandemic. Credit card delinquencies have surpassed pre-pandemic levels and continue to rise. Severe credit card delinquencies, those 90 days overdue, have now climbed to 10.7% \u2014 the highest since 2012. The findings show how pockets of financial stress continue to emerge in the US economy following three years of high inflation. \u201cIt is worrisome that so many Gen Zers are falling behind,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate.com. \u201dWe\u2019re seeing more people financing daily essentials such as groceries and gas, and this can be a tough cycle to break.\u201d \u2018Cause for concern\u2019 Even as stocks on Wall Street hit historic highs and unemployment remains unusually low, millions of Americans are struggling with the cost of living. \u201cThe rise in severe delinquencies \u2014 those over 90 days overdue \u2014 is a cause for concern,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY. The NY Fed found there is a direct link between maxing out credit cards and falling behind on payments. Very few Americans who have used 20% or less of their credit card limit have fallen behind on their bills, according to the research. However, the transition rate into delinquency for those who have used more than 60% of their credit card limit has now surpassed pre-Covid levels and continues to rise, the NY Fed said. A third of maxed-out borrowers are delinquent The researchers said this trend is \u201cespecially remarkable\u201d for those who have maxed out their cards, defined as using 90% to 100% of their limit. A third of maxed-out borrowers have gone delinquent in the last year, compared with less than a quarter before the pandemic, the NY Fed said. \u201cWhile most commentators discuss a soft landing for\u00a0the\u00a0economy or\u00a0the\u00a0consumer,\u201d Daco said, \u201cthe latest evidence on credit conditions points to multiple economies, multiple consumers, affected to different degrees by the higher cost and higher interest rate environment.\u201d Maxing out credit cards can hurt borrowers\u2019 credit scores. Under FICO Score\u2019s calculation, the ratio of balance-to-credit limit is the second most important category for determining credit scores. \u201cFICO will be closely monitoring this trend in the coming quarters to better understand whether this is simply a reversion to pre-pandemic consumer behaviors,\u201d Tommy Lee, senior director at FICO, told CNN in an email. The NY Fed explained that part of the reason Gen Z borrowers are maxed out is because they have much lower credit limits. Many younger Americans haven\u2019t had the time to build credit histories and credit scores that would let them borrow more. For instance, the median Gen Z borrower\u2019s credit limit is just $4,500, compared with $16,300 for Millennials and $21,800 for Gen X, the NY Fed said. The NY Fed declined to share historical data on maxed out credit cards by generation. During a call with reporters, NY Fed researchers explained that it\u2019s a \u201ctypical age pattern\u201d where younger borrowers have used up more of their credit card limit. Lee, the FICO executive, said history shows that as consumers age and their credit experience increases, so do their credit limits. Americans in low-income areas are more likely to be maxed out Of course, it\u2019s not just younger users maxing out their credit cards. The NY Fed found that borrowers who live in low-income areas are also more likely to be maxed out. About 12% of borrowers living in neighborhoods with the bottom 25% of incomes have maxed out their cards, the report found. That\u2019s more than twice the 5.5% of borrowers living in the highest income neighborhoods who are maxed out. There\u2019s never a good time to carry a credit card balance, but right now is arguably the worst time. The average credit card interest rate stands at 20.66%, according to Bankrate. That\u2019s just shy of the record high of 20.75% set last month. Daco said officials at the Federal Reserve must take into account the credit card stress some Americans are feeling as they decide when to lower interest rates. The Fed faces a delicate balance. Cutting rates prematurely could make inflation worse. But waiting too long could pile even more pressure on borrowers, especially if the jobs market slows and more people struggle to find work. \u201cThe risk of over-tightening could lead to unintended consequences that further strain household finances,\u201d Daco said. Ways to get out of debt Experts say there are possible solutions for people who feel trapped by credit card debt. Rossman, the Bankrate analyst, said options include: \u201cI know it\u2019s easier said than done,\u201d Rossman said, \u201cbut it\u2019s so important to make credit card debt payoff a priority.\u201d CNN\u2019s Alicia Wallace contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/business/gen-z-credit-card-users/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_business_child-care-cost-average-annual", "text": "If you think the rent is too damn high, wait until you get the bill for child care. Parents with two kids in a child care center paid on average at least twice as much for that care as they did for the typical rent in 11 states and the District of Columbia last year, according to Child Care Aware of America\u2019s latest annual report, released Wednesday. The states are: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin. Placing two kids at a child care center cost at least 25% more than the typical rent, on average, in every state in the US. And the tab exceeded annual typical mortgage payments in 45 states, plus the District of Columbia, according to Child Care Aware. The report looked at care for an infant and 4-year-old. The report also shows that child care continues to be a major financial burden for many parents, though it has stabilized somewhat since the Covid-19 pandemic upended the industry in 2020, forcing many providers to close their doors or jack up their prices to retain their workers and maintain a safe environment. Nationwide, the average annual cost of care rose to $11,582 per child last year, up 3.7% from the prior year. It was the smallest annual increase since the pandemic began and trailed inflation. Still, it would take 10% of a married couple\u2019s median income and 32% of a single parent\u2019s median income to afford that national average price tag, though the cost varies widely by state and locality, according to the report. The US Department of Health and Human Services recommends that families spend no more than 7% of their annual income on child care. Shortage continues The number of licensed child care centers inched up 1.3% to around 92,800 last year, according to the report, which contained data from 41 states. It had fallen as low as 88,200 in 2020 but is back to pre-pandemic levels \u2013 though that\u2019s still not enough to meet demand, said Sandra Bishop, Child Care Aware\u2019s senior director of research. Further exacerbating the shortage was the continued disappearance of licensed child care providers who operate out of their homes. The number slipped to about 92,200 providers in the 39 states that had available data. Though the rate of decline has slowed, the supply is still down from just over 107,000 providers in 2019. These businesses are often more challenging to run since the owners typically watch the children alone or with a small staff. This year could prove even more troubling for the child care industry. Some $24 billion in federal pandemic stabilization grants \u2013 which kept many centers afloat \u2013 expired last September, which is expected to result in tens of thousands of closures, according to an analysis by The Century Foundation. Also, another $15 billion federal pandemic infusion for child care and development block grants, which states use to subsidize child care for working families, will expire this coming September. \u201cMany states are doing a lot to invest in their child care systems, but it is hard to do it at the scale of those critical investments that happened as a part of our relief funding,\u201d said Anne Hedgepeth, Child Care Aware\u2019s chief of policy.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/business/child-care-cost-average-annual/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}

The announcement of Sutskever\u2019s departure comes one day after OpenAI unveiled its latest artificial intelligence model, GPT-4o, in a presentation that impressed onlookers with its capabilities. Sutskever\u2019s role at OpenAI will be filled by Jakub Pachocki, previously the company\u2019s director of research, according to the company. Sutskever made headlines nearly six months ago when he voted to remove Altman as chief executive and chairman of the board. CNN contributor Kara Swisher previously reported that the decision to fire Altman was driven by Sutskever\u2019s concerns that Altman had pushed AI technology \u201ctoo far, too fast.\u201d Days after Altman\u2019s ouster, Sutskever had a change of heart: He signed an employee letter calling for the entire board to resign and for Altman to return. Altman did not stay on the outs for too long. Five days after his firing, Altman returned to the company as CEO, and Sutskever issued a public apology for his role in the corporate drama. \u201cI deeply regret my participation in the board\u2019s actions,\u201d Sutskever wrote on X in November. \u201cI never intended to harm OpenAI. I love everything we\u2019ve built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company.\u201d In the months since, OpenAI has continued to push advancements of its flagship product, ChatGPT. Its latest model, announced Monday, will be available to unpaid customers and can effectively turn ChatGPT into a digital personal assistant that can engage in real-time spoken conversations. Sutskever played a defining role in OpenAI\u2019s rise to power in the AI scene. In 2019, Altman, Sutskever and Greg Brockman\u00a0jointly formed\u00a0OpenAI LP, a for-profit entity within the larger nonprofit company\u2019s structure. A few years later, the company earned a valuation of $90 billion.

Darlington and Scheffler had arrived at the course around the same time in preparation for the tournament. After reportedly attempting to drive around the scene of a fatal crash, Scheffler\u00a0was arrested and charged with a felony and other counts. He was later released and has since teed off in the tournament. Darlington was not only a witness to the incident, he also attempted to intervene. He was only several feet away from Scheffler when the golfer was arrested, and Darlington tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to explain to the police that Scheffler was a participant in the tournament. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be part of this story, we ended up being at least on the periphery,\u201d said ESPN commentator Dave Fleming on air after the incident. ESPN told CNN that the network is not commenting on this story. How the story unfolded Darlington broke the news of Scheffler\u2019s arrest in a series of posts on X and explained the incident in greater detail on ESPN\u2019s SportsCenter less than an hour later. He said the incident occurred around 6 a.m. after a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d in which Scheffler tried to circumvent police presence at the scene of an unrelated car accident that occurred outside of golf club. \u201cThe police officer attempted to attach himself to Scheffler\u2019s car, and Scheffler then stopped his vehicle at the entrance to Valhalla,\u201d Darlington wrote on X. \u201cThe police officer then began to scream at Scheffler to get out of the car. When Scheffler exited the vehicle, the officer shoved Scheffler against the car and immediately placed him in handcuffs.\u201d \u201cAt which point (Scheffler) - seeing me behind him - said \u2018can you help?\u2019 The police officers instructed me to step back,\u201d Darlington told audiences on air shortly after. In a video posted on X an hour later, Darlington follows the police officers as they lead Scheffler away. Several police officers tell him to step back. \u201cRight now he\u2019s going to jail. He\u2019s going to jail and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d one officer told Darlington, referring to Scheffler. Darlington clarifies that he\u2019s a member of the media, and the police reiterate that he needs to step back. \u201cThe police officers around the patrol car in which Scottie Scheffler was in had no idea he was even Scottie Scheffler,\u201d Darlington clarified on air. \u201cI say that because one police officer came up to me with his pad and said\u2026can you tell me the name of the person who was just arrested.\u201d Darlington said that players were told they were allowed to enter the facility, and that Scheffler said that he kept driving past the police vehicle because he \u201cdidn\u2019t know that he was a police officer.\u201d Scheffler charged with a felony Scheffler was charged with second-degree assault on a police officer \u2013 a felony \u2013 along with lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, according to Jefferson County court records. He\u2019s been released from jail, according to the Louisville Metro Department of Corrections. Attorney Steve Romines, who represents Scheffler,\u00a0told CNN affiliate WLKY that the golfer bypassed police because of a misunderstanding. \u201cThey were directing traffic, he held his media credential out and was going in like they\u2019d been instructed to,\u201d Romines said. Scheffler\u2019s attorney declined to comment on why the golfer was charged with assault, saying he will let the case play out in court. The PGA Championship tournament was delayed by an hour and a half, and began at around 8:30 Friday morning. \u201cThis morning\u00a0we were devastated to learn that a worker with one of our vendors was tragically struck and killed by a shuttle bus outside Valhalla Golf Club,\u201d PGA said in a statement. \u201cThis is heartbreaking to all of us involved with the PGA Championship. We extend our sincere condolences to their family and loved ones.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/media/espn-jeff-darlington-scottie-scheffler-arrest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}

Some universities have reached agreements with on-campus demonstrators, while others have cited safety concerns and canceled, postponed or relocated their schoolwide ceremonies. Several schools continue to grapple with pro-Palestinian protesters ahead of their spring commencement, subjecting themselves to internal scrutiny and public criticism. Protesters arrested at UPenn On Friday night, University of Pennsylvania police arrested 19 individuals, including seven students, following an attempt by pro-Palestinian demonstrators to occupy a university building, a\u00a0university spokesperson told CNN Saturday. Penn Against the Occupation announced their intention to occupy Fisher-Bennet Hall in\u00a0a post on the group\u2019s Instagram\u00a0Friday night, calling for people to \u201cflood UPenn for Palestine.\u201d The group called on the school\u2019s administration, in part, to divest from corporations \u201cthat profit from Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and occupation in Palestine and academically from Israel institutions, condemning the scholasticide of Palestinian scholars and universities,\u201d according to another Instagram post. Friday\u2019s arrests follow\u00a0the arrest of at least 33 people\u00a0on May 10 when law enforcement broke down a pro-Palestinian encampment erected on campus. The latest campus arrests also come just a few days before Monday\u2019s universitywide commencement ceremony, where students and their families will be subject to additional safety procedures\u00a0described as\u00a0\u201cairport-style security screening,\u201d the university said in a safety update earlier this month. Guests and graduates\u00a0will not be allowed\u00a0to bring signs, posters, flags and artificial noisemakers, according to school officials. UCLA and Sonoma State face internal division On Thursday, the Academic Senate at the University of California, Los Angeles rejected resolutions of no confidence and censure brought against Gene Block, the school\u2019s chancellor. The resolutions were brought forward in the\u00a0wake of an attack by counterprotesters\u00a0on an on-campus pro-Palestinian encampment on April 30, and claimed Block \u201cfailed to ensure the safety of our students and grievously mishandled\u201d the situation. The no-confidence resolution failed after only 43% of members voted in its favor. The resolution to censure failed to get the majority of votes required to pass by the senate. In all, 88 members voted in favor of the censure, while 88 opposed it, three abstained and 15 were present but didn\u2019t vote. \u201cIt is clear that we are not united in how we view the major events of the past weeks and the campus response to them,\u201d Chair Andrea M. Kasko said Friday in a statement. \u201cI hope that we can try to find common ground as colleagues, and have the courage to listen with open minds and open hearts even when we do not agree.\u201d Also Friday, Mildred Garc\u00eda, the chancellor of the California State University System, announced Sonoma State University President Mike Lee would be stepping down after he sent a message \u201cconcerning an agreement with campus protesters \u2026 sent without the appropriate approvals.\u201d The statement sent by Lee to the Sonoma State campus community on Tuesday included agreements to set up an advisory council of Students for Justice in Palestine as well as a review of the university\u2019s vendor contracts and investments, according to a copy of the message obtained by CNN. \u201cSSU will not pursue or engage in any study abroad programs, faculty exchanges, or other formal collaborations that are sponsored by, or represent, the Israeli state academic and research institutions,\u201d Lee wrote, adding study abroad programs in Israel will be \u201cterminated until further notice.\u201d On Wednesday, Garc\u00eda announced Lee had been placed on administrative leave for \u201cinsubordination.\u201d Morehouse threatens to shut down ceremony \u2018on the spot\u2019 In Atlanta, Morehouse College President David A. Thomas said he would shut down Sunday\u2019s commencement ceremonies \u201con the spot\u201d rather than allow police to remove student protesters during President Joe Biden\u2019s highly anticipated graduation speech. \u201cWhat we won\u2019t allow is disruptive behavior that prevents the ceremony or services from proceeding in a manner that those in attendance can partake and enjoy,\u201d Thomas told CNN\u2019s Victor Blackwell in an interview Thursday. \u201cSo, for example, prolonged shouting down of the president as he speaks. I have also made a decision that we will also not ask police to take individuals out of commencement in zip ties. If faced with the choice, I will cease the ceremonies on the spot If we were to reach that position.\u201d Biden\u2019s presence at Morehouse, one of the nation\u2019s preeminent historically Black colleges, comes as the president campaigns amid weak polling among young voters, even as many have expressed frustration with his administration\u2019s continued support of Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza. Biden has been\u00a0confronted by some protests\u00a0during his own speeches and campaign events. On January 23, his campaign speech on abortion rights at George Mason University in Virginia was interrupted\u00a0more than a dozen\u00a0times over his administration\u2019s support of Israel.

{"id": "2024_05_17_tech_neuralink-trial-participant-elon-musk-noland-arbaugh", "text": "Elon Musk\u2019s brain implant startup Neuralink is accepting applications for a second human trial participant to test its device, the billionaire said on X Friday. The request comes five months after Neuralink implanted a brain chip into its first human trial participant, 30-year-old Noland Arbaugh, and just a week after the company admitted that his implant had experienced an unexpected problem. Neuralink said that the threads connecting the chip to Arbaugh\u2019s brain had retracted, causing performance issues, although the company said it made adjustments to improve its function. Still, Arbaugh says the implant \u2014 which allows him to control a computer cursor with his brain \u2014 has changed his life. Arbaugh has been a quadriplegic since 2016 following a diving accident. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anything to wake up for in the morning, and this has changed that for me,\u201d Arbaugh told Good Morning America in an interview that aired on Friday. \u201cI was just very happy that I would be a part of something that I believe is so monumental. This is the next step forward of helping people with paralysis.\u201d Now, Neuralink is seeking more people like Arbaugh to test out its brain chip. \u201cIf you have quadriplegia and want to explore new ways of controlling your computer, we invite you to participate in our clinical trial,\u201d the company said on X. Ultimately, Neuralink\u2019s ambition\u00a0is to use\u00a0implants to connect human brains to computers to help, for example, paralyzed people to control smartphones or computers or blind people to regain sight. Like existing brain-machine interfaces, the company\u2019s implant would collect electrical signals sent out by the brain and interpret them as actions. The current trial participants will be part of what Neuralink is calling its PRIME Study, short for Precise\u00a0Robotically\u00a0Implanted Brain-Computer Interface. The intent is to study the safety of its implant and surgical robot and to test the functionality of its device, the company said in a 2023\u00a0blog post. The company says it is enrolling trial patients who have \u201climited or no ability to use both hands due to cervical spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\u201d Trial patients have chips surgically placed in the part of the brain that controls the intention to move. The chip then records and sends brain signals to an app, with the initial goal being \u201cto grant people the ability to control a computer cursor or keyboard using their thoughts alone,\u201d Neuralink previously explained. About a month after the operation, Musk said Arbaugh could control a computer mouse with his brain. Neuralink later posted a video showing Arbaugh using only his brain to play chess on a computer. But after his device developed an unexpected issue stunting its data processing speeds and performance, Arbaugh told Good Morning America that he \u201ccried afterwards.\u201d \u201cIt was very, very hard to give up all of the amazing things that I was able to do,\u201d he said. However, Neuralink says the issue was part of its learning process. \u201cThe reason we do clinical trials and early feasibility trials is to uncover these sorts of issues as early as possible before they get marketed,\u201d\u00a0DJ Seo, who co-founded Neuralink with\u00a0Musk, told Good Morning America. \u201cWe rolled up our sleeves and found various different ways for Noland to be able to recover his performance, which we have successfully been able to do.\u201d Consumers will not have widespread access to the technology anytime soon. Before Neuralink\u2019s brain implants hit the broader market, they\u2019ll need broader regulatory approval. \u2013CNN\u2019s Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_15_tech_schumer-ai-framework", "text": "Federal legislation to govern artificial intelligence took another step closer to reality on Wednesday as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, along with a bipartisan trio of senators, announced a sprawling blueprint to shape how congressional committees tackle the technology in forthcoming bills. The 31-page roadmap released this week calls for billions of dollars in government spending to accelerate AI research and development, reflecting earlier commitments by Schumer, a Democrat from New York, and the so-called \u201cAI gang\u201d to prioritize US innovation in an intensely competitive field. It also instructs multiple Senate committees to come up with guardrails for AI to address some of its biggest risks, such as AI-enabled discrimination, job displacement and election interference. \u201cHarnessing the potential of AI demands an all-hands-on-deck approach and that\u2019s exactly what our bipartisan AI working group has been leading,\u201d Schumer said Wednesday. Some of the document\u2019s proposals reflect longstanding congressional goals, such as the creation of a national data privacy law that gives consumers more control over their personal information and which could help regulate AI companies\u2019 use of such data. Others appear modeled after legislation adopted by the European Union, such as a proposed ban on the use of AI for social scoring systems akin to those implemented by the Chinese government. And it urges congressional committees to develop coherent policies for when and how to impose export controls on \u201cpowerful AI systems\u201d \u2014 or for designating certain AI models as classified for national security purposes. The roadmap endorses a recommendation to allocate at least $32 billion a year, or at least 1% of US GDP, on AI research and development, a proposal issued in a 2021 report by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence. The organizing plan developed over months of meetings and listening sessions with top tech companies, civil rights leaders, labor unions and intellectual property holders. And it seeks to reinvigorate a legislative push that began last year, after Schumer took a personal role in spearheading the effort along with New Mexico Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich and Republican Sens. Mike Rounds of South Dakota and Todd Young of Indiana. \u201cThis roadmap represents the most comprehensive and impactful bipartisan recommendations on artificial intelligence ever issued by the legislative branch,\u201d Young said Wednesday. The latest plan highlights how Senate leaders are trying to move from a learning phase to an action phase, by issuing assignments to committees to craft legislation that may be passed piecemeal. Schumer has previously said that with the 2024 elections fast approaching, he may make it a top priority to pass legislation aimed at protecting the elections from AI-driven interference. Schumer has described regulating artificial intelligence as a challenge for Congress unlike any other, vowing a swift timeline measured in months, not years. But policy analysts, and some congressional aides, doubt whether Congress can pass significant legislation regulating AI in an election year. Meanwhile, the European Union has surged ahead with AI regulation, giving final approval in March to the trading bloc\u2019s landmark EU AI Act that bans certain AI applications altogether and imposes significant restrictions on others deemed to be \u201chigh-risk.\u201d On Wednesday, some in the tech industry applauded the Senate roadmap\u2019s release. \u201cThis AI policy roadmap is an encouraging start, focusing on defending the screen and recording industries against the use of unauthorized replicas,\u201d said Dana Rao, general counsel and chief trust officer at Adobe. \u201cIt will be important for governments to provide protections across the wider creative ecosystem.\u201d Rao urged lawmakers to pass legislation enshrining a national right against impersonation to protect artists from AI-generated clones of themselves. \u201cTechnology is borderless, and as a global leader in innovation, the US needs a clear national AI policy with guardrails so American innovation in AI can safely flourish,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, CEO of the Consumer Technology Association. Some consumer advocates were more critical, saying the roadmap was vague in its recommendations for addressing AI risks. \u201cThe framework eagerly suggests pouring Americans\u2019 tax dollars into AI research and development for military, defense, and private sector profiteering. Meanwhile, there\u2019s almost nothing meaningful around some of the most important and urgent AI policy issues like the technology\u2019s impact on policing, immigration, and worker\u2019s rights,\u201d said Evan Greer, director of the advocacy group Fight For the Future, adding that the document \u201creads like it was written by Sam Altman and Big Tech lobbyists.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/tech/schumer-ai-framework/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_investing_boeing-shareholders-vote-to-approve-usd33-million-ceo-pay-package", "text": "Shareholders of embattled airplane maker Boeing approved a pay package of nearly $33 million for outgoing CEO Dave Calhoun at the company\u2019s annual general meeting on Friday. That\u2019s the highest package ever paid to the company\u2019s CEO and a 45% increase from the $22.6 million he received for 2022. The vast majority of the bump comes from a giant stock bonus granted on top of his more-than-a-million-dollar salary. Calhoun, who has led Boeing since 2020, announced in March that\u00a0he will leave the company by the end of the year. The shareholder vote on Friday was made to approve Calhoun\u2019s 2023 pay package. Calhoun has said he declined to accept an additional annual incentive bonus of $2,800,000 for the year \u2013 a request the board said he made after the Alaska Airlines incident. Upon his retirement, Calhoun is set to take home another going-away present: a $45 million mix of stock awards and options that vest over time. The approval comes as the plane maker is facing additional scrutiny for a series of safety incidents,\u00a0including a mid-air blowout of part of a fuselage in January, which prompted a number of investigations into the company\u2019s practices, an executive shakeup and promises that the company will turn itself around. Boeing has been struggling financially for five years, since fatal crashes of its 737 Max in late 2018 and early 2019 resulted in a 20-month grounding of its best-selling plane. It was also hit by the pandemic, which caused a near-halt in air travel for months and deep losses at most airlines that buy its planes. \u201cOur compensation program is designed to align leadership pay with the long term performance of our business,\u201d said Steve Mollenkopf, Boeing\u2019s new chairman, when asked how the company can justify such a high compensation package given recent safety grievances. \u201cIt\u2019s really driven by meeting our commitments to the highest safety and quality standards.\u201d Since the start of the grounding in 2019 the company has reported adjusted losses totaling more than $31 billion, and losses are projected to continue going forward. \u201cThe board is confident that the current compensation structure continues to directly align with performance and balances both the meaningful progress made to restore operational and financial strength along with the fact that certain performance criteria has not been met,\u201d he said. The compensation committee \u201ctook swift action to make significant design changes to our compensation plan in 2024\u201d after the Alaska Airlines incident in January, Mollenkopf said. The annual incentive metric now gives greater weight to operational metrics, like safety and quality. Shares of Boeing (BA) were down 0.1% in afternoon trading.

{"id": "2024_05_17_media_trump-hush-money-trial-reporters-spotlight", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. The\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0hush money trial is dragging reporters into uncomfortable territory and laying bare the complicated relationships journalists often have with sources. Michael Cohen, who continued to testify Thursday, invoked from the stand the names of several high-profile media figures, putting their relationships with the former Trump fixer in the spotlight. Cohen named\u00a0The New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman\u00a0and\u00a0MSNBC\u2019s Katy Tur\u00a0as reporters which he had established relationships with. He alleged without evidence that\u00a0ABC News\u2019 John Santucci\u00a0had tried to pay for the rights to\u00a0Stormy Daniels\u2019 story. And he spoke about having recorded dozens of phone calls with media figures, including former\u00a0CNN\u00a0boss\u00a0Jeff Zucker. To be clear, a reporter having working relationships with sources is not unethical \u2014 it\u2019s often a hallmark of being a strong journalist and it does not translate into taking orders or publishing unvetted information. Reputable news outlets like ABC News do not pay for interviews, but trying to secure a sit-down with a high-profile subject is anything but uncommon. And speaking on the phone with a source while the person on the other end of the line secretly records says a lot more about that individual than the journalist. For now, much of what has been described by Cohen in court appears to be routine, run-of-the-mill behavior that occurs each and every day in journalism. But the general public does not work in a newsroom, and regular interactions with sources can be framed in such a way that removes key context and portrays a routine reporting process as nefarious. That context is crucial. For example, Haberman has indisputably been one of the most authoritative reporters on Trump. For years, her byline has dogged the Queens-born developer-turned-politician, exposing corruption, revealing embarrassing secrets, and shedding light on his authoritarian impulses. In return, Trump has ranted and raged at her endlessly. The notion that Haberman is a commissioned stenographer for Trump is preposterous. But for Haberman \u2014\u00a0or any reporter\u00a0\u2014 to get information from Trump-world requires cultivating thorny relationships with sources, many of whom are slimy figures. It is neither unusual nor unethical for journalists to be cordial to the sources whom they get information from. That does not mean they print whatever these sources send them or function as their mouthpieces. It simply means that they have established a relationship that is conducive to the flow and exchange of information. And when the journalist deems that information to be newsworthy, they might then be able to publish it for the world to see. It\u2019s also worth noting that many of the top journalists covering Trump world have complex histories with the key figures in the case. A witness like Cohen or an attorney like\u00a0Todd Blanche\u00a0might be motivated to cast various journalists in unflattering light. In many ways, the Trump hush money trial has become something of a Rorschach test. People see what they want to see, ignoring evidence before their eyes that runs counter to their chosen narrative. And for the faction of the public that believes some members of the press are too cozy with Trump world, seeing Cohen discuss his relationships with the news media has only reinforced their views. That reporters are playing a starring role in the trial is also a function of the Trump years. The former president, seeking to use the news media as a foil, cast the journalists covering him as characters in his unrelenting show. Through vile attacks, he moved the reporters from behind the scenes onto the front lines. And so now, amid his criminal trial, it is fitting that members of the press are once again finding themselves in the awkward position of being part of the very story they are covering.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/media/trump-hush-money-trial-reporters-spotlight/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
