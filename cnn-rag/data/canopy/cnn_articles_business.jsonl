{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_business_japan-aging-society-baby-care-nhk-dg", "text": "The world\u2019s population is getting older in what the United Nations calls an \u201cirreversible global trend,\u201d driven by longer lives and smaller families. The number of people aged 65 and older is expected to more than double to 1.6 billion globally by 2050, according to a UN report published last year. In Japan, this change is threatening one of the world\u2019s largest economies as the percentage of older people grows and fewer couples have children. In early June, the country said the number of babies born fell for the eighth straight year, hitting a record low of 727,277 births in 2023 since Japan started compiling data more than 120 years ago. A few months earlier, Japan said that one in 10 people were aged 80 or older, making it the oldest country in the world. Last year, almost 30% of the Japanese population was 65 or older. In June 2023, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida unveiled a multi-billion dollar package of measures to encourage families to have more children. Japan is trying to tackle a demographic crisis that could impact pension funding and health care as\u00a0the workforce shrinks and demand from the aging population surges. The growth of the older population is also changing the consumer product market. Demand for adult diapers in Japan has been rising, while the need for baby diapers has fallen. The global market value for adult diapers was pegged at $12.8 billion in 2023, according to market research provider Euromonitor International. It is expected to reach almost $15.5 billion by 2026. In Japan, the adult diaper market stood at $1.7 billion in 2023, and is expected to grow to $1.9 billion in 2026, accounting for more than 12% of the global total. One example of a company adjusting to this shift is Japanese manufacturer Oji Holdings, which announced in March it would stop producing baby diapers for the Japanese market later this year to focus on incontinence products for adults. The company will continue to run its overseas baby diaper business, it said. Their combined baby diaper sales in China, Indonesia and Malaysia have grown despite a slowdown in the domestic market, where the company sold 7.3% more diapers for adults than babies in 2023. Other Japanese companies have already been adjusting to this shift. Electronics giant Panasonic\u00a0has been researching and developing products aimed at the older population since 1990, according to its website. Kitchen appliance manufacturer Zojirushi is offering product features aimed at senior citizens, such as electric teapots that send an email to a registered address when in use so relatives can keep up with the activities of their elderly family members. Japan isn\u2019t the only place in Asia grappling with aging. South Korea, which has the world\u2019s lowest fertility rate, reported a new low of 0.72 babies per woman in 2023, down from 0.78 in 2022. The government is so concerned it has set up a new agency: the Ministry of Low Birth Rate Counter-Planning. Births are also falling in Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan. According to the UN, six Asian countries or territories will place in the top 10 for the largest share of people age 65 or older in 2050, with Hong Kong leading the list. By 2100, Africa is expected to be the only region where senior citizens represent less than 15% of the population.\u00a0Seniors in Europe, Northern America and Latin America and the Caribbean will likely surpass the 30% threshold by then, according to the UN\u2019s forecast. Although Europe and Northern America now have the highest share of older citizens, Northern Africa, Western Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are expected to experience the fastest growth in the number of older people in the next 30 years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/business/japan-aging-society-baby-care-nhk-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_04_24_tech_nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc", "text": "Texting on the Moon? Streaming on Mars? It may not be as far away as you think. That\u2019s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets. A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year \u2014 the exact date has yet to be confirmed \u2014 carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon\u2019s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth. \u201cThe first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,\u201d Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation. The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia\u2019s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice. One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice. Images of ice \u2014 transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network \u2014 would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon. For NASA\u2019s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable. Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund \u2014 especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated. \u201cBeing able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis \u2014 as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,\u201d said Engelund. \u201cEventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.\u201d It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth\u2019s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing \ufeffspace colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth. NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy. Bell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the \u201cframework for the lunar economy.\u201d \u201cA future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,\u201d Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN. \u201cThis includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.\u201d There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too. If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth \u2014 such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms. \u201cEspecially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,\u201d Klein said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/tech/nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_media_redbox-bankruptcy", "text": "The parent company of Redbox, those distinctive, red-colored kiosks at grocery stores that sell or rent DVDs, has filed for bankruptcy after enduring months of financial struggle. Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment (CSSE) revealed in a filing that it has nearly $1 billion in debt and owes millions of dollars to several entertainment companies including the BBC and Sony Pictures, plus to retailers ranging from Walmart to Walgreens. Filings show that the company took on about $325 million in debt following its purchase of Redbox in 2022 from private equity giant Apollo Global Management. The plan was to make it into an entertainment conglomerate, combining the DVD rental business with its free streaming services, like Crackle, the entertainment platform once owned by Sony. Those plans didn\u2019t pan out, hindered by dual Hollywood strikes that limited production of fresh content and the decline of people renting physical DVDs that even forced rival Netflix to quit that part of its business last year. CSSE declined to comment. Deadline previously reported that Redbox hadn\u2019t paid employees for a week, and medical benefits have been suspended. Filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy could help the company fix those issues if its plans are approved by a court in Delaware. The company\u2019s publishing arm, which produces those ubiquitous self-help books that were once a worldwide phenomenon, isn\u2019t affected by the bankruptcy filing of its entertainment unit.

{"id": "2024_07_02_economy_global-debt-crisis", "text": "Governments owe an unprecedented $91 trillion, an amount almost equal to the size of the global economy and one that will ultimately exact a heavy toll on their populations. Debt burdens have grown so large \u2014 in part because of the cost of the pandemic \u2014 that they now pose a growing threat to living standards even in rich economies, including the United States. Yet, in a year of elections around the world, politicians are largely ignoring the problem, unwilling to level with voters about the tax increases and spending cuts needed to tackle the deluge of borrowing. In some cases, they\u2019re even making profligate promises that could at the very least jack up inflation again and could even trigger a new financial crisis. The International Monetary Fund last week reiterated its warning that \u201cchronic fiscal deficits\u201d in the US must be \u201curgently addressed.\u201d Investors have long shared that disquiet about the long-term trajectory of the US government\u2019s finances. \u201c(But) continuing deficits and a rising debt burden have (now) made that more of a medium-term concern,\u201d Roger Hallam, global head of rates at Vanguard, one of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, told CNN. As debt burdens mount around the world, investors are growing anxious. In France, political turmoil has exacerbated concerns about the country\u2019s debt, sending bond yields, or returns demanded by investors, soaring. The first round of snap elections Sunday suggested that some of the market\u2019s worst fears might not come to pass. But even without the specter of an immediate financial crisis, investors are demanding higher yields to buy the debt of many governments as shortfalls between spending and taxes balloon. Higher debt servicing costs mean less money available for crucial public services or for responding to crises such as financial meltdowns, pandemics or wars. Since government bond yields are used to price other debt, such as mortgages, rising yields also mean higher borrowing costs for households and businesses, which hurt economic growth. As interest rates rise, private investment falls and governments are less able to borrow to respond to economic downturns. Tackling America\u2019s debt problem will require either tax hikes or cuts to benefits, such as social security and health insurance programs, said Karen Dynan, former chief economist at the US Treasury and now professor at the Harvard Kennedy School. \u201cMany (politicians) are not willing to talk about the hard choices that are going to need to be made. These are very serious decisions\u2026 and they could be very consequential for people\u2019s lives.\u201d Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard University, agrees that the US and other countries will have to make painful adjustments. Debt is \u201cnot free anymore,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cIn the 2010s, a lot of academics, policymakers and central bankers came to the view that interest rates were just going to be near zero forever and then they started thinking debt was a free lunch,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was always wrong-headed because you can think of government debt as holding a flexible-rate mortgage and, if the interest rates go up sharply, your interest payments go up a lot. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened all over the world.\u201d \u2018Conspiracy of silence\u2019 In the United States, the federal government will spend $892 billion in the current fiscal year on interest payments \u2014 more than it has earmarked for defense and approaching the budget for Medicare, health insurance for older people and those with disabilities. Next year, interest payments will top $1 trillion on national debt of more than $30 trillion, itself a sum roughly equal to the size of the US economy, according to the Congressional Budget Office, Congress\u2019s fiscal watchdog. The CBO sees US debt reaching 122% of GDP a mere 10 years from now. And in 2054, debt is forecast to hit 166% of GDP, slowing economic growth. So how much debt is too much? Economists don\u2019t think there is a \u201cpredetermined level at which bad things happen in markets,\u201d but most reckon that if debt hits 150% or 180% of gross domestic product, that means \u201cvery serious costs for the economy and society more broadly,\u201d said Dynan. Despite growing alarm over the federal government\u2019s debt pile, neither Joe Biden nor Donald Trump, the main 2024 presidential candidates, are promising fiscal discipline ahead of the election. During the first televised presidential debate last week, hosted by CNN, each candidate accused the other of making America\u2019s debt situation worse, either through tax cuts by Trump or additional spending by Biden. British politicians have also buried their heads in the sand ahead of a general election Thursday. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, an influential think tank, has decried a \u201cconspiracy of silence\u201d between the country\u2019s two main political parties, over the poor state of public finances. \u201cRegardless of who takes office following the general election, they will \u2014 unless they get lucky \u2014 soon face a stark choice,\u201d IFS director Paul Johnson said last week. \u201cRaise taxes by more than they have told us in their manifestos, or implement cuts to some areas of spending, or borrow more and be content for debt to rise for longer.\u201d Countries trying to tackle the debt issue are struggling. In Germany, ongoing infighting over debt limits has put the country\u2019s three-way governing coalition under enormous strain. The political standoff could come to a head this month. In Kenya, blowback over attempts to address the country\u2019s $80 billion debt burden has been much worse. Proposed tax hikes have sparked nationwide protests, which have claimed 39 lives, prompting President William Ruto to announce last week that he would not sign the proposals into law. Enter the scary bond market But the problem with putting off efforts to rein in debt is that it leaves governments vulnerable to far more painful disciplining by financial markets. The United Kingdom offers the most recent example in a major economy. Former Prime Minister Liz Truss triggered a collapse in the pound in 2022 when she tried to force through big tax cuts funded by increased borrowing. And the threat hasn\u2019t gone away. Take France. The risk of a financial crisis there became a serious concern virtually overnight after President Emmanuel Macron called a snap election last month. Investors were worried voters would elect a parliament of populists bent on spending more and cutting taxes, further swelling the country\u2019s already-high debt and budget deficit. Even though this worst-case scenario now looks less likely, what happens after next Sunday\u2019s second round of voting is far from certain. Yields on French government bonds have continued creeping up, reaching their highest level in eight months Tuesday. Dynan at the Harvard Kennedy School says financial markets can quickly become unnerved by \u201cpolitical dysfunction\u201d that causes investors to doubt a government\u2019s willingness to make good on its debt. \u201cWe tend to have a lack of imagination about the scope for things going wrong. If there\u2019s a big event in which the market freaks out about (US) debt, it\u2019s not going to be something that was on our radar,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/economy/global-debt-crisis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}

In the lawsuit, filed Sunday in New York state court, the president\u2019s sonaccuses Fox News of unjust enrichment, intentionally inflicting emotional distress, and violating New York civil rights laws. The lawsuit makes good on\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s threat he made in April that he would take the network to court if it didn\u2019t immediately issue retractions and corrections. The miniseries, \u201cThe Trial of Hunter Biden,\u201d was a six-part offering on the Fox Nation digital streaming network, and was also promoted on Fox News, the cable TV channel. It featured a dramatized \u201cmock trial\u201d about Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas financial dealings that led in part to his federal tax indictment and that also fueled House Republicans\u2019 struggling impeachment inquiry into his father. Fox News\u00a0took down the miniseries\u00a0in late April, one day after Hunter Biden threatened to file a lawsuit. But according to the lawsuit, promotional materials for the miniseries are still on some Fox News-linked social media pages, and the miniseries episodes are still circulating \u201conline and in the public domain.\u201d A Fox News spokesperson claimed the lawsuit was meritless and \u201centirely politically motivated,\u201d and said the network looks forward to \u201cvindicating our rights in court.\u201d \u201cThe core complaint stems from a 2022 streaming program that Mr. Biden did not complain about until sending a letter in late April 2024,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe program was removed within days of the letter, in an abundance of caution, but Hunter Biden is a public figure who has been the subject of multiple investigations and is now a convicted felon. Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden\u2019s own making.\u201d The new lawsuit claims Fox News \u201ctargeted Mr. (Hunter) Biden in an effort to harass, annoy, alarm, and humiliate him, and tarnish his reputation.\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s son is seeking an unspecified amount of punitive damages, as well as any profits that Fox reaped from the miniseries, and other corrective measures. \u201cThe miniseries is fictionalized; it is not a news event. It was made for the purpose of trade and advertising, and merely exploits Mr. Biden\u2019s name, image, and likeness for Fox\u2019s commercial benefit,\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers wrote in the lawsuit. Hunter Biden\u2019s team said in the lawsuit that without his consent, Fox News \u201cunlawfully published numerous intimate images (both still and video) of Mr. Biden depicting him in the nude, depicting an unclothed or exposed intimate part of him, as well as engaged in sex acts.\u201d The right-wing network said these images originated form Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0infamous laptop\u00a0\u2013 data from which was leaked by allies for former President Donald Trump in 2020. The president\u2019s son was\u00a0convicted at a trial\u00a0last month on federal gun charges, and faces a second trial this fall on alleged tax crimes.

Late last year, Meta (META)\u00a0launched\u00a0a service called \u201cSubscription for no ads,\u201d allowing European users of Facebook and Instagram to pay up to \u20ac12.99 ($14) a month for ad-free versions. The alternative is to accept versions with personalized ads. The European Commission said in a statement Monday that, in its preliminary view, \u201cthis binary choice forces users to consent to the (use) of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalized but equivalent version of Meta\u2019s social networks.\u201d If the provisional findings of the Commission\u2019s investigation are confirmed, the EU could hit Meta with a fine equivalent to 10% of its global annual revenue under its landmark Digital Markets Act. Based on the company\u2019s 2023 results, that would amount to $13.5 billion. Meta said it didn\u2019t accept the Commission\u2019s findings. \u201c\u2019Subscription for no ads\u2019 follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.\u201d The EU announcement comes a week after the Commission accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the DMA by preventing app developers from freely directing consumers to cheaper services. The regulators are also investigating Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) under the new law. The DMA, which came into force in March, requires dominant online platforms \u2014 so-called gatekeepers \u2014 to give users more choice, and rivals more opportunities to compete. Online platforms often collect personal data across their own and third-party services and use it in digital advertising services. Margrethe Vestager, a European Commissioner in charge of competition policy, noted in Monday\u2019s statement that Meta had been accumulating personal data of \u201cmillions of EU citizens over many years.\u201d \u201cWe want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalized ads experience,\u201d she said. Michael Koenig, a senior official at the Commission, said Meta must offer users an alternative to \u201cfull\u201d ad personalization that \u201cdoes not rely on this personal data and which is then automatically less personalized and still available to them.\u201d \u201cThen Meta is free to keep a third option, which is a subscription not to see ads at all, or a fourth option which may have some premium features,\u201d he told journalists. The Commission is due to conclude its probe into Meta by late March next year.

That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries, such as journalism, about how artificial intelligence can \u2013 or even should \u2013 be used. A new tool, called \u201cYour Daily Olympic Recap on Peacock,\u201d will enable 10-minute highlights packages, which can include events updates, athlete back stories and other related content personalized by subscriber preferences. The company said the highlights could be packaged in about 7 million different ways, pulled from 5,000 hours of live coverage in Paris, effectively making AI (the artificial intelligence, not the man) a significantly more efficient way to deliver personalized recaps.  \u201cWhen I was approached about this, I was skeptical but obviously curious,\u201d Michaels said in a press release. \u201cThen I saw a demonstration detailing what they had in mind. I said, \u2018I\u2019m in.\u2019\u201d A NBC spokesperson told CNN Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. Michaels, a long-time broadcaster, is currently the play-by-play sportscaster for Thursday Night Football on Amazon Prime. He\u2019s also known for his work on previous Olympics Games broadcasts for both NBC and ABC and for calling the Miracle on Ice Game at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. NBC said the AI system was trained using prior NBC broadcast audio from Michaels. The company said a team of NBC Sports editors will review all of the content, including audio and clips, to make sure everything is factually accurate and names are pronounced correctly. The highlights tool will be available on Peacock via web browsers and iOS and iPadOS apps starting July 27.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/tech/al-michaels-ai-olympics/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}

The interview is a major get for ABC News and an important moment for Biden, following his halting debate performance. Although Biden has made several public appearances since the debate, he has read prepared remarks at those events. This will be his first off-the-cuff appearance since the debate. Several White House allies have publicly and privately called for Biden to immediately hold some sort of live interview or press conference to help assuage fears over the president\u2019s acuity. ABC did not immediately respond a request for comment about whether it plans to publish the full unedited version of the interview. Due to timing constraints, networks usually edit down interviews for shows. Biden\u2019s last major interview was with David Muir in Normandy last month. He previously spoke to CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on May 8 and with Time magazine\u2019s Massimo Calabresi on May 28.

{"id": "2024_07_06_economy_summer-job-market-teens", "text": "Your kid\u2019s summer camp is likely fully staffed. The ice cream store near you probably doesn\u2019t have a \u201chelp wanted\u201d sign up. But your local swimming pool or nearby beach could probably use a lot more lifeguards to keep it fully open this summer. \u201cTeens are coming back in. They\u2019re more engaged in the job market than their much older brothers and sisters,\u201d said Paul Harrington, a labor economist at Rhode Island College who coauthors an annual report on the teen summer job outlook. The shift is a refreshing change after the pandemic drove many teens away from working during their summer breaks. And yet, lifeguards are in much shorter supply. More teens want to work The share of teenagers who are looking for work or who are currently working, also referred to as the teen labor force participation rate, has been steadily increasing. Heading into the summer, the labor force participation rate for people ages 16 to 19 was 37.4%, according to fresh data from the June jobs report released on Friday. That\u2019s close to the highest level it\u2019s been since 2009. Eric Brotherson, human resources manager at Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park, an amusement park located in the heart of the Colorado Rockies, is witnessing that firsthand. \u201cHiring right now is way better than it was a year ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a good spot.\u201d The park aims to employ around 250 people each summer, which in recent years has been a big challenge, Brotherson said. That prompted him to start recruitment efforts for this summer much earlier than in prior years. A little trick he\u2019s learned is to always text applicants before calling them. \u201cWe found that so many young applicants don\u2019t have a voicemail or don\u2019t check them,\u201d he said. But when he texts them notifying them that he\u2019ll be calling soon to interview them, they almost always pick up, he noted. Pay increases are certainly helping Andy Pritikin, owner and director of Liberty Lake Day Camp in Bordentown, said in prior summers some staff he greeted at orientations before camp started were nowhere to be found on the first day of camp. After the pandemic caused a spike in mental health problems, particularly for cooped-up teens and 20-year-olds, Pritikin said many parents he heard from told their kids to prioritize their mental health by doing things they enjoy, like going away with friends or relaxing at the beach rather than working. \u201cNow I\u2019m seeing parents pushing their kids to work again,\u201d said Pritikin, who employs around 350 staff members each summer. This year, he said, \u201cthere are no staffing issues at all.\u201d But pay increases are also playing a role. Even though he can\u2019t match the wages at service and retail jobs, which have spiked since the pandemic, he has steadily increased pay. Ten years ago, high school-aged camp staff made around $1,000 for an entire summer. Now most are making close to $2,100, not including tips. Overall, inflation-adjusted median weekly pay for teens ages 16 to 19 grew from $289 in 2019 to $336 in 2023, a 13% increase, according to estimates Harrington and his coauthors of the teen summer job outlook report made using government data. On a percentage basis, those gains outpace what all other age groups 20 years and up saw during the summer from 2023 to 2019. The gains have come as employers have become more desperate to hire workers, due to persistent shortages in the labor market. But wages in the overall labor market have started to slow as more positions get filled. Still, even with the wage gains teens have seen, many of them could be taking jobs this summer out of financial necessity. \u201cTeens may be helping out their own households in many cases, saving for the high cost of college,\u201d Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement and business research firm, said in a recent statement. He\u2019s forecasting that 1.3 million teens will be employed this summer. That would amount to 300,000 more teen workers compared to last summer, but is still slightly below the average over the past decade. Even with pay bumps, some shortages persist Nationwide, hiring an ample number of lifeguards to staff beaches, pools and waterparks has continued to be a major challenge. Last year, over 300,000 pools were closed or operating at a limited capacity due to a lifeguard shortage, according to the American Lifeguard Association. New York City has had a particularly hard time hiring lifeguards over the last few summers \u2014 and this year isn\u2019t looking much better. That\u2019s despite offering returning lifeguards a $1,000 bonus if they stay on through August 25 as well as raising hourly wages to $22, a 3% increase from last summer and a 13% increase from 2022. Additionally, in order to attract more workers, the city eased the requirements this year for lifeguards staffing the shallowest pools. But heading into the July 4 weekend, just 750 lifeguards were working across 50 public pools and eight beaches in New York City. That\u2019s well below the 1,000 lifeguards the city estimates it needs to fully staff those beaches and pools. However, it\u2019s more than there were at the same time last year, New York City Mayor Eric Adams told reporters at a press conference earlier in the week. To contend with the shortage, the city has opted to close off sections of beaches and pools rather than closing some locations entirely, Gregg McQueen, a spokesperson for the city\u2019s parks department, told CNN. \u201cWe adjust the available swimming space based on daily lifeguard headcount. We\u2019ll always open as much swimming space as possible,\u201d McQueen said. Adams has been advocating for expediting work licenses for migrants and asylum-seekers to ease lifeguard shortages. \u201cIt makes no sense that we have jobs that are available, could be filled, and we\u2019re not allowing employees to fill them,\u201d he said. But, nationally, the pay raises going to lifeguards are likely enticing more people to get certified, said Tom Gill, vice president of the United States Lifesaving Association, a nonprofit organization that certifies agencies that hire lifeguards at beaches. \u201cThere is not an agency I am aware of that has not raised their pay rate in the last two years substantially,\u201d Gill said. But he acknowledged that raises alone are not enough to combat the shortage of lifeguards. \u201cLifeguard agencies are facing competition that does not involve physical standards, intense training and the responsibility of the lives of thousands of swimmers in a dynamic environment daily,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/economy/summer-job-market-teens/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}

According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way.

In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech.

{"id": "2024_06_17_success_how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges", "text": "Long before you take your high schooler on college campus tours, consider this: Shopping for college shouldn\u2019t be any different than shopping for a home.\u00a0When you want to buy a home, you come up with a range of how much you can afford and get pre-qualified for a mortgage. Then you look in neighborhoods that offer homes that meet your family\u2019s needs and fall within your price range. \u201cAdopt a mindset that we\u2019re buying college like we\u2019re buying a house,\u201d said Beth Walker, author of \u201cBuying College Better\u201d and \u201cNever Pay Retail for College.\u201d As a financial adviser and certified\u00a0college planning specialist, Walker tries to help families avoid a situation that many find themselves in at the 11th hour: Their child applies \u2014 and gets into \u2014 schools they cannot afford because the schools won\u2019t give them enough aid. And then they just \u2026 try to make it work, no matter how much debt is involved for the parents or the student. Instead, she advises families to start as early as 9th or 10th grade in figuring out what is affordable for them as a family \u2014 so parents don\u2019t sacrifice their own financial welfare and the future college student doesn\u2019t drown in debt upon graduation. And second, she recommends assessing how a child\u2019s talents and interests pare with majors and careers they might want to pursue. Doing both those things can help you target the right colleges to apply to. Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners, defines the perfect college as one \u201cwhere a student can go be happy, safe and successful, graduate in four years or less with a marketable degree and little or no debt.\u201d In helping families align parents\u2019 affordability constraints with their student\u2019s academic and social needs, he cautions them not to automatically assume the Ivys or other high-prestige schools will be best simply because of their status. And he stresses what success in life looks like after college and notes that an Ivy League degree isn\u2019t the only path to achieving it, especially if your child won\u2019t get much aid to attend. In fact, said Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, a lot of brand-name schools don\u2019t even offer merit-based aid, only need-based. So if you\u2019re not rich, but you make too much to qualify for need-based aid, you could find yourself having to cover the entire cost of tuition, room and board every year, which is pushing $90,000 at some US colleges. Set up financial guardrails well before the college search Fothergill created a free calculator called CostHero that lets parents assess what financial resources they will have available to pay for a child\u2019s college education. It then provides a range of affordability: At the low end is the number representing what they can pay if they don\u2019t take on debt. And at the high end is the number they can pay if they also take out an unsubsidized federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). \u201cIf you\u2019re not in a position to write a check for $90,000 a year, put up guardrails for yourself so you don\u2019t blow up your retirement,\u201d he said. The calculator inputs let you set the amount of resources you\u2019re willing to use to pay for college from your income and savings, your child\u2019s earnings from summer jobs, any family gifts, and any federal Stafford loans your child may take. It also factors in if you qualify for the federal American Opportunity Tax Credit. That credit, for qualified educational expenses, will reduce your tax bill or increase any refund you have coming. The calculator also gives you a debt-to-income score like the kind a mortgage lender might use to assess whether you\u2019re a good credit risk. Ideally, he said, you don\u2019t want your housing costs to exceed 36% of your gross income and your total debt \u2014 including debt from housing, cars, credit cards and any parental education loans \u2014 to exceed 43%. If your DTI ratio is close to or higher than 43% that is a sign you could get yourself into trouble if you end up having any financial problems while your child is in college, Fothergill said. \u201cIf folks have a way to determine the range of affordability prior to the onset of the college search, the outcomes are a lot better.\u00a0 For example, if one knows that the range of affordability is between $30,000 [a year] with no parent debt and $50,000 with parent debt, then any college that comes in with a net cost in that range is, by definition, affordable,\u201d Fothergill said. Net cost refers to the true cost of attendance after figuring out how much aid your child may get (e.g., grants and scholarships). Figure out where your student may qualify for the most aid Generally speaking, the biggest tuition discounts go to the most academically accomplished students in an incoming class. \u201cThe student needs to be in the top 25% of those admitted,\u201d Walker said. Getting into that top 25% cohort is based on SAT or ACT scores, and having a high, unweighted GPA based on a rigorous high school curriculum. The curriculum\u2019s academic rigor can be further bolstered by taking AP courses. Since your child is more likely to make the top quartile at some schools than others, Fothergill and Walker both recommend your child focus on applying only to those schools in which they stand the best chances of being in that top group to maximize their chances for merit-based aid. Otherwise, you\u2018ll spend money to apply to guidance-counselor-recommended \u201csafety\u201d schools or \u201creach\u201d schools with no sense if those places are affordable to you should your child get in. Using reported data from admissions officers about their key criteria in admitting an incoming class and based on what more than 1,000 schools report about the qualifications they used to grant aid, Fothergill created another tool called ListHero. It gives students a score that helps gauge\u00a0how competitive their profile is\u00a0at a given school, relative to others admitted, and by extension their eligibility for tuition discounts. Right now the tool is only available to college planning professionals for a fee. But Fothergill plans to create a free mini-version for consumers to use. For parents doing their own research on test scores, GPA requirements, costs and aid, he recommends checking the Department of Education College Scorecard, the site CollegeData.com and the College Board. Other ways to reduce college costs before applying While your children are in high school they can take other steps to reduce the total cost of their education. One way is by doing well on the PSAT to qualify to compete for a National Merit Scholarship. Another is to take AP courses. If their high school doesn\u2019t offer them, there is a program called Freshman Year for Free offered by the Modern States Education Alliance. It provides free AP placement courses and pays the fee for students to take the AP tests or college-level preparation (CLEP) tests administered through the College Board. Getting the minimum AP scores a college requires to earn a college credit will lower how much you ultimately have to spend on tuition. A third option is to see if your state has a program that offers a year of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to a state university from which your child could earn their degree. Or, if you plan to go to any other college, make sure the school will accept the credits from a community college course you plan to take. No matter what steps you take, starting the research and budgeting process early can save everyone a lot of stress, debt and potential heartache in the end. Said Walker: \u201cWe have to be a lot more intentional about this purchase.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/success/how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_business_free-medical-school-tuition", "text": "Bloomberg Philanthropies is gifting $1 billion to make medical school free for the majority of students at Johns Hopkins University, joining other high-profile donors who have contributed to tuition-free medical schools across the country. In a letter by Michael Bloomberg in the Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019 annual report, the billionaire said the donation addresses twin challenges: declining health and declining education. Johns Hopkins said Monday that for most medical school students, the gift will cover the full cost of attendance, including tuition and living expenses. Students from families earning less than $300,000 will be eligible for the gift. Living expenses will be covered for students who come from families that earn less than $175,000. It\u2019s not the first medical school to receive such a gift. In February, students at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York received free tuition after a $1 billion dollar donation from a former faculty member, Dr. Ruth Gottesman. In 2018, NYU\u2019s School of Medicine became the\u00a0first medical school in the country\u00a0to offer free tuition to accepted students. In the letter, Bloomberg, a Johns Hopkins alumnus, said life expectancy in the US is still lagging behind other countries since the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic also hurt public education, Bloomberg said, noting that \u201cremote schooling was a disaster for students.\u201d The high cost of medical school deters students from lower-income families from applying, the former New York City mayor said. He added that confronting this \u201chealth crisis\u201d should unite both political parties. An\u00a0October survey\u00a0from the Association of American Medical Colleges found that 70% of medical students who graduated in 2023 have taken on some level of education debt. The average graduate left medical school owing more than $200,000, according to the AAMC. \u201cMany who do matriculate end up dropping out because of financial pressures. And those who graduate often choose to work in the most lucrative specialties in order to repay their debts, rather than in fields and communities that are most in need,\u201d Bloomberg said, adding there are too few primary care doctors in the US. Bloomberg previously donated $1.8 billion in 2018 to undergraduate financial aid at Johns Hopkins University.

{"id": "2024_07_08_investing_france-election-euro-market-reaction", "text": "French stocks and government bonds struggled to find direction Monday following surprise results in France\u2019s parliamentary elections, which saw left-wing parties outperform the far right Sunday, leaving the country\u2019s parliament facing gridlock. The yield, or return sought by investors, on benchmark 10-year bonds ticked down to 3.18% by late afternoon local time, reversing a slight rise recorded earlier in the day. The premium traders demand to hold French bonds instead of the ultra-safe German equivalents was also lower on the day. However, it was still a lot higher than before French President Emmanuel Macron called the snap elections on June 9. French markets have been unsettled ever since Macron\u2019s shock decision, which came after his Renaissance party lost to the far right in a vote for European Union lawmakers earlier in June. The 46-year-old centrist has driven pro-growth economic reforms in Europe\u2019s second-biggest economy, which investors fear could now be rolled back under a very different parliament. French finance minister Bruno Le Maire warned in a post on X Monday that the \u201cmost immediate\u201d risks following Sunday\u2019s results were a financial crisis and a national economic decline. Le Maire pointed to the \u201cexorbitant, ineffective and dated\u201d plans of the New Popular Front, the left-wing alliance of parties that came first after the second-round vote Sunday. Implementing these plans would \u201cdestroy\u201d the achievements of Macron\u2019s centrist government, which have created jobs and new factories over the past seven years, he argued. Analysts\u00a0at Rabobank\u00a0said Monday that uncertainty over the composition of the next government\u00a0was\u00a0likely to keep\u00a0the risk premium on French government bonds \u2014 the so-called spread over German debt \u2014\u00a0at \u201celevated levels\u201d compared with\u00a0before Macron announced the snap elections. The New Popular Front beat Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally in Sunday\u2019s vote, putting it in third place, in a stunning reversal of first-round results. But with the left falling short of the 289 seats needed for a majority and with a weakened president, the national assembly is expected to be more fractured than ever. France is now set for a prolonged period of instability as three opposing blocs with competing ideas and agendas try to form a coalition or find themselves stuck in a state of paralysis. \u201cThe so-called \u2018Republican Front\u2019 whereby parties co-operate to block the far right\u2019s ascendance to power proved remarkably successful but leaves the parliament split,\u201d\u00a0the\u00a0Rabobank analysts wrote in a note Monday. \u201cWe are now likely looking at a period of policy paralysis.\u201d France\u2019s CAC 40 index, which represents 40 of the biggest companies listed in Paris, was up 0.13% by late afternoon local time, reversing a fall notched earlier in the day. The index has dropped 3.9% since Macron called the snap\u00a0elections. The euro was broadly steady against the US dollar by 9.43 a.m. ET, having bobbed up and down slightly earlier in the day. The value of the currency, which is shared by 19 other countries in the EU, has swung wildly since\u00a0June 9. Gridlock on debt? A gridlocked parliament raises the specter of a government unable to pass key reforms, including measures to reduce France\u2019s huge government debt pile, which was equal to 110.6% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product at the end of last year. The budget deficit \u2014 the difference between what the government spends and what it receives in taxes \u2014 reached 5.5%\u00a0of GDP last year. The New Popular Front has made sweeping spending commitments, including a substantial increase to the minimum wage and a freeze on prices for many essential goods. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at bank Berenberg, called the group\u2019s plans \u201cunaffordable\u201d in a note Monday. \u201c(The election result) threatens to exacerbate France\u2019s fiscal problems,\u201d he wrote, adding that France would likely struggle to pass a budget for next year that complied with EU rules. \u201cThe strong showing for the united left as a whole makes it difficult for the moderate left to break ranks with the far left and ditch the most expensive parts\u201d of the New Popular Front\u2019s fiscal plans, Schmieding added.

Technically, it\u2019s called the \u201cIce Cream Short Course,\u201d and it\u2019s offered one week every year at Penn State University. Some people simply refer to it as \u201cice cream college.\u201d \u201cOur target audience is people who are serious about ice cream,\u201d says Dr. Bob Roberts, Ph.D., the head of the food science department at Penn State. This is the place where the ice cream people go to learn about ice cream.\u202fSome companies, like Tillamook, send people every year. Employees from Hudsonville, Turkey Hill, Perry\u2019s, Stewart\u2019s Shops, Hershey, Friendly\u2019s, Graeter\u2019s, Jeni\u2019s, Baskin Robbins and more all attended this year. Even Ben and Jerry (yes, the Ben and Jerry) once took a version of the class. Well, that\u2019s definitely not me. Yes, I have a passion for ice cream. My first job was working at a small ice cream stand, and now I\u2019m the person who will drive miles out of the way to find the local homemade scoop shop. But I\u2019m no professional. I make ice cream at home with my countertop Cuisinart, testing out recipes and flavors. I simply wanted to learn more, so I found my way to Penn State. I knew the course would be serious, but I\u2019m not going to lie, I still thought I\u2019d be eating ice cream every day. I didn\u2019t. I thought I\u2019d be making ice cream. I didn\u2019t. But the Penn State Short Course turned my passion into a true appreciation, because now I understand why one pint of ice cream can cost $10, and another costs $5. The science of\u2026 ice cream? Very quickly, I learned that ice cream college is just that \u2014 college. There was homework, extra help sessions (I absolutely went), studying (aka cramming), an exam, class rankings (to my relief, only the top 10 were revealed), an ending banquet and certificate (um, is this graduation?). And I wasn\u2019t alone as an amateur. About one third of the class said they had little to no experience or were an aspiring entrepreneur. One couple was even taking the course as part of their honeymoon! But what was ice cream college all about? In a word: science. Ross Cohen, the CEO and co-owner of Sweet Cow, a Colorado ice cream company, said understanding the science behind ice cream matters. \u201cThe most important thing I learned was better understanding our ice cream mix\u2013 that\u2019s the milk, cream and sugar and all the goodness that is the base of every ice cream we make\u2013 better understanding how the ingredients interact with each other.\u201d And understanding the ice cream mix means learning what\u2019s happening at a molecular level. For example, how the milk proteins interact with fat and what happens when you change an ingredient. That meant classes on milk composition, dairy ingredients, food microbiology and ice cream physics. \u201cEverything is easy when things work,\u201d Dr. Bob told me. \u201cWhen things don\u2019t work \u2026 you need to understand the science. You need to understand the chemistry. You need to understand the engineering.\u201d Once you understand that, he said, you can figure out how to change those ingredients (think: almond milk instead of cow\u2019s milk) and still have a product that looks, feels and tastes like ice cream. This was on display in one of our labs\u2014 a sensory evaluation class. We were presented with 14 samples of vanilla ice cream. Ok, I know what you\u2019re thinking\u2026 a sampling class sounds awesome! Yes, it was. But I can assure you, that much ice cream in one sitting requires pacing and strategy. And again, it\u2019s about science. We tasted 14 ways to make vanilla, and each tasted different. Some were dense and melted slowly (higher milk fat content). Some had a flavor similar to dulce de leche (cooked longer). Others were light in weight (higher air content). The idea? Not all ice cream is created equal, and understanding ingredients matters for your final product. From cow to cone The Penn State Ice Cream Short Course has a 132-year history. The school describes itself as \u201ccow to cone,\u201d which means students can see cows being milked and then follow as that milk gets made into ice cream and eventually sold at the famous Berkey Creamery, all on campus. The passion behind the treat-making shows in Penn State\u2019s numbers. Years ago, the course took several months to fill up. Now, it takes just days, or even hours, depending on the year. Dr. Bob remembered a recent year when there was so much demand that the Penn State registration system crashed. The people who put on the course, Cohen said, \u201care true ambassadors for the industry.\u201d They open their \u201cdoors to anyone to get a real inside look at what they do.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re looking to share every bit of knowledge to help people get better,\u201d he said. For the professionals, said Ruben Urrutia, a 30-year ice cream veteran who\u2019s now the director of plant operations for Tillamook, the course is \u201cjust that extra notch in our belt to make us a little bit stronger in our field of expertise.\u201d\u202fHe likened it to NFL players reviewing film of their games. For amateurs, the course peels back the curtain on something that for many, is simply a vehicle for joy and community but is much more complex in its creation. No matter their background \u2014 ice cream dreamer or expert \u2014 there\u2019s one thing everyone seemed to agree on. The course\u2019s biggest benefit was the people you meet and the network you build at the class. Students have an idea what the course is going to cover, but you don\u2019t know fully what it all entails, so there\u2019s an organic we\u2019re-in-this-together feeling right away. Dr. Bob said his job \u201cis to make the canvas that (students) can paint on.\u201d \u201cI hope they go away with a good network of ice cream connections so that when they have a question, they know who to call to get an answer,\u201d he said. I know I have. I walked away from Penn State with my own ice cream community that\u2019s rooting for me as I churn away in my little countertop machine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/business/ice-cream-best-shop-maker/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices", "text": "Actress Judy Garland never recorded her voice to read an audiobook of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but you\u2019ll soon be able to hear her rendition of the children\u2019s novel that inspired the movie nonetheless. Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}

Lomax said the station prides itself on being an independent, trustworthy voice for its primary audience of Black Philadelphians and that using questions that were provided ahead of time \u201cjeopardizes that trust and is not a practice that WURD Radio engages in or endorses as a matter of practice or official policy.\u201d \u201cWURD Radio is not a mouthpiece for the Biden or any other Administration,\u201d she added. Lawful-Sanders, who hosted \u201cThe Source,\u201d spoke with Biden last week and asked him four questions about what\u2019s at stake in this election, his accomplishments, his debate performance and what he would say to hesitant voters. In an interview Saturday with CNN\u2019s Victor Blackwell, she said those questions were part of eight that were recommended to her by Biden aides ahead of the interview. \u201cThe questions were sent to me for approval. I approved them,\u201d she said. The move has further inflamed the maelstrom that has been swirling over Biden\u2019s acuity since his lackluster performance in the first presidential debate, which was hosted by CNN. Biden\u2019s debate performance has left many top Democrats wringing their hands in frustration and concern amid talk that he should not accept the party\u2019s nomination. \u201cIf the White House is trying now to prove the vim, vigor \u2026 of the president, I don\u2019t know how they do that by sending questions first before the interview so that the president knows what\u2019s coming,\u201d said Blackwell. Blackwell pointed out that both Lawful-Sanders and Earl Ingram, host of \u201cThe Earl Ingram Show\u201d in Milwaukee who also interviewed the president this week, asked Biden \u201cessentially the same questions.\u201d A Biden campaign spokesperson on Saturday did not deny the campaign provided questions, but said, \u201cWe do not condition interviews on acceptance of these questions.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not at all an uncommon practice for interviewees to share topics they would prefer. These questions were relevant to the news of the day \u2014 the president was asked about this debate performance as well as what he\u2019d delivered for black Americans,\u201d spokesperson Lauren Hitt said in a statement. The Biden campaign said later Saturday it will no longer suggest questions to interviewers. \u201cWhile interview hosts have always been free to ask whatever questions they please, moving forward we will refrain from offering suggested questions,\u201d a source familiar with the Biden booking operation told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/media/biden-interview-radio-host-philadelphia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}

Not a subscriber? You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. A vast swath of the US economy is showing signs of weakness as unemployment rises to its highest point in more than two years. Consumer demand seems to have tapered off so far this summer, according to surveys of American businesses that sell any kind of service to make a profit, ranging from restaurants to dental clinics. That weakness is also evident in the latest spending figures \u2014 a far cry from last year\u2019s lucrative summertime spending spree when Americans shelled out for films and high-profile concerts. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s latest monthly survey that gauges economic activity in the services sector showed that so-called new orders and overall economic activity unexpectedly slipped into contraction territory last month. The headline index fell to a reading of 48.8 in June from 53.8 in May as the new orders sub-index saw an even steeper decline, down to 47.3 from 54.1. (A reading above 50 indicates expansion while anything below that threshold points to a contraction.) This apparent slowdown in demand, if it persists for long enough, could translate into service-providing businesses hiring at a slower pace and possibly slashing jobs. The overwhelming majority of employment in the United States is considered service-providing, specifically 86% of the 158.6 million total US jobs as of June. \u201cWhen you think of services, a lot of it is driven by the consumer, and consumers are key to where the US economy goes,\u201d James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see stress in more and more households.\u201d The US consumer is indeed under pressure, grappling with still-high inflation, the highest interest rates in more than two decades, depleted pandemic savings (according to some measures), and a growing load of debt. Consumer spending, which makes up about 70% of the US economy, has already moderated over the past few months, government statistics show, and retailers themselves have said they\u2019ve noticed shoppers across the income spectrum change their purchasing behavior. A food services business surveyed by ISM said \u201csales and traffic remain soft compared to last year,\u201d blaming \u201chigh gas prices in California and constant news about inflation and restaurant menu prices.\u201d Spending at restaurants and bars declined 0.4% in May,\u00a0according to the latest Commerce Department figures on retail sales. A retail company told ISM: \u201cWith inflation continuing, will customers have enough discretionary funds to spend?\u201d Knightley provided CNN an analysis of government data showing that Americans in the top 20% of earners were responsible for a large share of spending on services related to transportation (air travel and cruises), recreation, food and finance. The bottom 60% of households by income accounted for a larger proportion of spending on health care services. But it takes time before slowing demand translates into slower hiring or layoffs because businesses have to determine if they didn\u2019t just deal with a bad month or two, perhaps even a bad quarter,\u00a0Scott Hamilton, global chairman of human resource and compensation consulting at Gallagher, told CNN. Service-providing businesses have already been hiring at a weaker clip. These firms have added 168,000 jobs a month, on average, from April through June, according to\u00a0fresh Labor Department data\u00a0released Friday. That\u2019s much lower than the average for the prior three months, from January through March, which was 241,000 jobs. Last year, the average monthly job gain in the services industry was 228,000 jobs. Hiring trends, of course, vary within the services sector, a huge slice of the job market. Last month, retail trade employment shrunk for the first time since November while temporary help services contracted by 48,900 jobs, dragging down the broader professional and business services super sector, which lost 17,000 workers. Health care has been one major bright spot for the services sector, adding jobs at a brisk pace for the past few decades, excluding a drop off in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but even then, some businesses in that industry have recently noticed softening demand. \u201cDemand for services has moderated after near-record patient levels in the last month,\u201d a health care and social assistance firm said in the latest ISM survey. The job market staged a stunning comeback when the broader US economy recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic, eventually leading to unemployment falling to a half-century low of 3.4% in 2023 for the first time. It\u2019s loosened up recently, however, with unemployment now at 4.1%, the highest level since November 2021, and new applications for jobless benefits on an upward trend. Fed officials are keeping a close eye for any alarming signs of weakness in the job market as they await for further evidence that inflation will continue to slow without an unexpectedly hot economy sabotaging that. Tesla is now an official Chinese government car For the first time ever, Tesla cars have been placed on a Chinese government purchase list, according to state-owned media outlet\u00a0Paper.cn. Tesla is the only foreign-owned EV car brand on the purchase catalog published by the government of Jiangsu province in eastern China. The other brands mentioned include Volvo, owned by China\u2019s Geely, and state-owned SAIC, reports my colleague Laura He.That means that government agencies and public groups in the province can procure them as service cars, highlighting the\u00a0cozy relationship\u00a0China has with Elon Musk\u2019s company. The development has gone viral on Chinese social media, with some users questioning if foreign cars should be considered for use by the government. The Jiangsu government has tried to ease such concerns by saying that the Tesla model is \u201ca domestic car, not imported,\u201d according to\u00a0a report\u00a0by state-owned National Business Daily on Thursday, citing a government employee. Tesla, which has a massive gigafactory in Shanghai, manufactured some 947,000 cars in China in 2023, and most of them were used locally. Read more here.

{"id": "2024_07_02_business_tesla-sales", "text": "Tesla sales fell for the second straight quarter. It marks the the first time in the company\u2019s history that sales declined from the previous year for two quarters in a row. Tesla\u2019s sales for the quarter came in at nearly 444,000 cars, down about 5% from a year ago. That\u2019s less than the 8.5% drop the company saw in the first quarter. But Tesla, and its share price that has made CEO Elon Musk one of the wealthiest people in the world, has been built on a history of growing auto sales. The drop in sales demonstrates the increased competition within the market for electric vehicles. While overall sales of EVs continue to grow, the pace of industrywide growth has proved to be less than expected, resulting in investors clamoring for each car sold to be more profitable than before. Before this year there was only one quarter in Tesla\u2019s history \u2014 at the peak of the pandemic when factories were closed by stay-at-home orders \u2014 that the company had reported a year-over-year decline in sales. There was some good news in the sales numbers though. Sales were stronger than the 436,000 forecast from some analysts. And it was enough to beat out Chinese automaker BYD to retain the lead position in global sales of purely electric vehicles. On Monday, BYD reported EV sales of 426,000. That is 21% more than a year ago, as BYD continues to close the gap on Tesla. In the fourth quarter BYD briefly passed Tesla in global EV sales. But the better-than-expected Tesla sales were enough to lift shares of Tesla (TSLA) by more than 9% in midday trading. Shares are still down about 8% year-to-date, however, even with Tuesday\u2019s jump. Tesla has been steadily cutting prices for more than a year now in the face of growing competition from established automakers, which are shifting from petroleum-powered automobiles to EVs, such as BYD in China, as well as Volkswagen, General Motors and Ford in Europe and North America. Those price cuts have helped to support sales but have squeezed profit margins. Tesla announced Tuesday that it will report its second quarter financial results on July 23. GM did not report global sales, but it did report US sales figures Tuesday, and its US EV sales jumped 40% compared to a year ago, and 34% from its first quarter total to about 22,000, a record for the automaker. Its overall sales were essentially flat, rising 0.6%, partly hit by the problem with the hack of the CDK platform used by many of its dealers. The strong EV sales were balanced by a slight drop - about 0.3% - in sales of traditional gasoline powered cars. This occurred even as it discontinued what had been its best-selling American EV, the Bolt, which had sales fall 90% from the 14,000 it sold a year ago. But jumps in sales for its Blazer EV and Cadillac Lyriq more than made up for the lost Bolt sales. It continues to offer new EV versions and will have 10 in the US dealerships by the end of the year. Toyota\u2019s US EV sales soared even more, rising 301% to 11,600. But even though they are both grabbing more EV market share, they account for only a fraction of Tesla\u2019s sales. While Tesla does not break out its sales by country in its quarterly sales statement, its filings suggest that somewhere between 43% to 49% of its automotive sales revenue comes from US sales, suggesting about 190,000 of the cars it delivered in the quarter went to US customers. GM and Toyota together have only about one-sixth of that total. But the declining sales show that the increased competition is having an impact on its sales. It has a very old lineup of vehicles for the most part. The Model S, its flagship sedan, has not had a clean-sheet re-design since its launch in 2012. The Model Y, its bestselling model has been little changed since its unveiling in 2019. And the Model Y is one of its newer models. Late last year it started production of its Cybertruck pickup, and the vehicle has seen severe questions about its build quality. Last week Tesla announced the third and fourth recalls of the Cybertruck due to problems with its huge single windshield wiper and a piece of plastic trim along the edge of the truck bed that can detach from the truck while being driven. Virtually all of the 12,000 Cybertrucks that have been sold to customers are included in the recall. In April there was another recall due to an accelerator pedal that could stick down.

On Monday, Gill said in a Securities and Exchange filing that he purchased about 9 million Chewy shares (CHWY), amounting to a 6.6% stake in the company. Chewy shares closed 6.6% lower on Monday after jumping as much as 10% earlier in the session. Chewy shares began gaining last Thursday after Gill, the individual investor who helped spark the frenzied trading around GameStop shares three years ago, posted a photo of a cartoon dog on his X account. The cartoon\u2019s blue background appeared to be the same blue as Chewy\u2019s logo. Shares of the company surged more than 34% that day at its highs before closing 0.3% lower. Meme stocks more typically move on social media sentiment than fundamentals, often posting huge swings based on the buying and selling of influential traders like Gill. Ryan Cohen, the founder of Chewy, is the chief executive of GameStop, the embattled video game retailer Gill is known for championing. Gill revived the meme stock frenzy in May after breaking a three-year social media hiatus to post a cartoon on X. He then posted periodic screenshots of what appeared to be his E*Trade account showing a mammoth position in GameStop shares and options, sending shares of the video game retailer on a wild ride. CNN has not independently verified the screenshots. Last month, Gill revealed that he owns about 9 million shares of GameStop and has exited his huge options position. On Monday\u2019s filing, a question stated: \u201cCheck the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat.\u201d Gill checked the box stating \u201cI am not a cat,\u201d a possible reference to his Congressional testimony about the meme stock frenzy in 2021 when he told the House Financial Services Committee the same statement.

{"id": "2024_07_08_media_paramount-global-skydance-merger-announcement", "text": "Paramount Global\u2014the sprawling media empire behind CBS,\u00a0MTV, and one of Hollywood\u2019s most storied movie studios\u2014has agreed to merge with technology scion David Ellison\u2019s Skydance Media,\u00a0ending years of speculation over the company\u2019s fate. The deal\u00a0announced late Sunday\u00a0comes just weeks after a previous offer from Ellison to acquire Paramount collapsed in the eleventh\u00a0hour, stunning industry observers and raising questions about the beleaguered media company\u2019s future. The agreement\u00a0cements Ellison as a media mogul, ending Shari Redstone\u2019s control of Paramount through her family\u2019s National Amusements holding company, after her father, the late Sumner Redstone, won a fierce bidding war to piece together the media conglomerate beginning in the 1980s. The complicated transaction will see Skydance first buy National Amusements, then merge with Paramount, valuing Skydance at $4.75 billion. Ellison\u2019s production company\u00a0will \u201cinvest $2.4 billion to acquire National Amusements for cash and $4.5 billion for the stock/cash merger consideration to be paid for publicly traded Class A shares and Class B shares, as well as $1.5 billion of primary capital to be added to Paramount\u2019s balance sheet,\u201d it said. The combined company will be helmed by Ellison as chief executive and former NBCUniversal chief Jeff Shell as president. In a call with investors Monday morning, Ellison and Shell laid out their strategy for Paramount, aiming to become a \u201ctechnological leader\u201d in the streaming space, and announcing reorganization plans that will include $2 billion in cost cuts.\u201cWe love the creative engine of this company, but obviously a big chunk of the company is in the linear world \u2014 and we know that linear is challenged and declining,\u201d Shell said. \u201cI think a lot of us in the business know we\u2019ve got to run these businesses in a different way as they decline.\u201d The deal caps a tumultuous and protracted saga that began in December, with the two companies entering into exclusive negotiations in April, resulting in\u00a0the ouster\u00a0of longtime Paramount chief executive Bob Bakish. In the meantime, the company has been run by a triumvirate of leaders: Brian Robbins, chief executive of Paramount Pictures; Chris McCarthy, chief executive of Showtime and MTV Entertainment Studios; and George Cheeks, chief executive of CBS. While legacy media companies have struggled in recent years, Paramount, with its extensive portfolio of cable channels including MTV and Comedy Central, has been heavily exposed to the earthshaking consumer shift away from the traditional television model to streaming services. As services like Netflix exploded in popularity, millions of people abandoned cable packages in favor of lower-priced on-demand streaming shows and movies. Paramount, with its heavy reliance on the television business, was caught flat-footed. In an attempt to stave off declining cable revenues, Paramount spent billions building its own streaming service, Paramount+. But\u00a0it was late to the game, and\u00a0like the rival streaming platforms erected by other legacy media companies, the service has struggled to gain enough traction with consumers to supplement its losses in the linear television business. The iconic company\u2019s valuation has also plunged amid the turmoil, with shares of Paramount falling more than\u00a075% in the last five years.\u00a0At a company town hall last month, Robbins acknowledged it had been a turbulent period as questions swirled over the conglomerate\u2019s future. \u201cWe\u2019d like to take a moment to acknowledge the challenges of all the M&A speculation surrounding our company. We know what a difficult and disruptive period it has been,\u201d Robbins said. \u201cAnd while we cannot say that the noise will disappear, we are here today to lay out a go-forward plan that can set us up for success no matter what path the company chooses to go down.\u201d While Redstone had been approached in recent years to sell off pieces of Paramount\u2019s extensive media portfolio, including Showtime and the cable network BET, several high-priced deals to break up the company were ultimately rejected. In recent months, as takeover offers for Paramount began to once again heat up, Sony Pictures and\u00a0the private equity firm\u00a0Apollo Global Management offered a $26 billion deal that would have made Sony the majority shareholder and Apollo the minority shareholder.\u00a0But the deal would have resulted in the breakup of Paramount, a prospect that Redstone rejected over her strong attachment to the\u00a0company\u00a0that her father had spent decades building. The sale to Skydance Media, founded in 2010 by David Ellison, son of Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, offered Redstone an offer she couldn\u2019t refuse: billions in cash and the comfort of selling the family company to the heir of another titan who has promised to invest into Paramount\u2019s future. Skydance and Paramount also had a deep established relationship, partnering\u00a0in recent years\u00a0to produce some of the box office\u2019s biggest blockbusters, including \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d films. \u201cGiven the changes in the industry, we want to fortify Paramount for the future while ensuring that content remains king,\u201d Redstone said in a statement. \u201cOur hope is that the Skydance transaction will enable Paramount\u2019s continued success in this rapidly changing environment.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/media/paramount-global-skydance-merger-announcement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}

Sherwood has been blind for more than 15 years; he has a family, a successful investing career and a dog, Chris, who helps him navigate the world. But he says everyday tasks like shopping still present hurdles to his independence. Artificial intelligence could soon help. Currently, Sherwood says he sometimes uses an app called Be My Eyes, which pairs visually impaired users with sighted volunteers who provide help, through live video, with things like checking whether a shirt matches the rest of an outfit or if a carton of milk has expired. But advancements in AI technology are already beginning to remove the need for volunteer helpers on the other end. Be My Eyes partnered with OpenAI last year to enable its AI model, rather than another human, see and describe what\u2019s in front of a user. In OpenAI\u2019s latest product demo, the company showed a clip of a person using the AI-powered version of Be My Eyes to hail a taxi \u2014 the app told the user exactly when to raise their arm for the car. Google in May announced a similar feature for its app \u201cLookout,\u201d which is designed to help visually impaired users. Applications for blind users are just one area where AI is helping to advance what\u2019s known as \u201cassistive technology,\u201d tools designed to help people who are disabled or elderly. Apple, Google and other tech companies have rolled out a growing slate of AI-powered tools to make life easier for people with a range of impediments, from eye-tracking tools that let physically disabled users control their iPhones with their eyes to detailed voice guidance for blind users of Google Maps. Since the stunning launch of ChatGPT more than a year ago, it has been clear that AI will change our world by upending how we work, how we communicate and even what we perceive as reality. But for people with disabilities, AI also has the potential to be life-altering in an entirely different way. \u201cIt used to be that if you were in business and you were blind, you had to have an administrative assistant reading to you,\u201d Sherwood said. \u201cBut now, you have this new power \u2026 For some, this is great technology. For blind people, this is an opportunity to gain employment and an opportunity to compete in business, an opportunity to succeed.\u201d The benefits of AI for accessibility Tech companies have been using early forms of AI to make their products more accessible for years \u2014 think, automated closed captioning on videos or screen readers. But experts say that the huge data sets and powerful computing systems behind more recent AI models are accelerating what\u2019s possible in the assistive tech space. For instance, in order for an AI tool to reliably help blind people hail taxis, it needs to be very good at recognizing what a taxi does or does not look like, which requires training the model on a huge corpus of examples. Another example: a Google tool that tells blind or low-vision users about what\u2019s on their screen, has been upgraded with a \u201cquestion and answer\u201d feature that incorporates the company\u2019s generative AI technology. \u201cThe promise of AI has been evident for many, many years but it has to reach this quality level before it can be a viable thing that you include in products,\u201d Eve Andersson, Google\u2019s senior director of product inclusion, equity, and accessibility, told CNN. New generative AI tools are especially promising for accessibility applications because they\u2019re designed to understand and produce information in various formats, including text, audio, photos and videos. That means if a person needs to consume information in a certain medium, AI can act as a go-between; for instance, turning a piece of audio into written text for a hearing-impaired user. \u201c(People\u2019s) accessibility needs take many different forms, but a large class of disabilities are really about input and output, it\u2019s about how a person perceives information,\u201d Andersson said. \u201cThere are hearing disabilities, vision, motor, speech, cognitive and all of these can involve a need for different modalities (of information) and one thing that AI is fantastic at is translating between modalities.\u201d Designing inclusive AI systems Ensuring that AI systems continue to serve all kinds of users requires ongoing investment. Because AI models are trained on human-created data, experts have warned that they may replicate the same biases present among humans. And early examples have already cropped up, including AI image generators that appeared to struggle with the concept of race, or an algorithm that allegedly showed job advertisements based on gendered stereotypes. In one effort to address that risk, a group of Big Tech companies, including\u00a0Apple, Google, Microsoft and others,\u00a0have partnered with researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign to create a training dataset for AI speech recognition tools that includes a diversity of speech patterns. Speech recognition tools, such as translators, voice assistants and voice-to-text apps can be especially important and useful for users with disabilities. The effort, called the Speech Accessibility Project, involves collecting recordings from volunteers with conditions such as Parkinsons, Down Syndrome, ALS and other disabilities that can affect speech. With the help of the project\u2019s now more than 200,000 recordings, a sample speech recognition tool created by the researchers misunderstands speech only 12% of the time, down from 20% prior to being trained on the new dataset. \u201cThe more diverse types of speech we can get into those machine learning systems and the greater variety of severity, the better those systems are going to be at understanding individuals that don\u2019t have \u2018audiobook narrator\u2019 speech,\u201d said Clarion Mendes, a speech language pathologist and clinical assistant professor who helps lead the project. \u201cI have talked to so many people throughout this project who face huge barriers to life participation because of their communication, individuals with impressive degrees who can\u2019t find employment because of their communication barriers,\u201d Mendes said. \u201cIf something like assistive technology can make it possible for individuals to find enrichment in their hobbies, in their jobs \u2026 all of a sudden these activities that used to take excessive amounts of time or require the person to rely on other individuals, that has increased their independence exponentially.\u201d Andersson added that investing in AI for accessibility is not just the right thing to do, it also makes good business sense. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to leave people behind \u2026 technology in general has the ability to level the playing field,\u201d Andersson said. \u201cBut there are also financial reasons like being able to sell your products to government entities, to educational institutions.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/tech/ai-assistive-technology-disabilities/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_07_05_business_ultra-rich-indian-weddings-economy-intl-hnk", "text": "The wedding of the year is\u00a0here. In less than a week, Anant Ambani, son of Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, will marry his girlfriend Radhika Merchant. India is no stranger to opulent weddings, but the preparations and parties for this particular union have transfixed the country. Jaw-dropping guest lists, which have included Silicon Valley\u00a0billionaires and Bollywood stars, have underscored Mukesh Ambani\u2019s growing influence in the global economy. Asia\u2019s richest family has also shown off its wealth with a display of jewels evoking the long-gone era of maharajahs and Mughal emperors. The Ambanis have set a new benchmark for big, fat Indian weddings, which are bound to grow bigger and louder than ever before as the number of the ultra-rich swells in the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy. \u201cThe Ambani wedding parties have \u2026 had a multi-faceted impact on the wedding industry in India, influencing trends, boosting demand for wedding vendors, promoting cultural heritage and even driving economic growth,\u201d Tim Chi, CEO of The Knot Worldwide,\u00a0a wedding planning service,\u00a0told CNN. The Indian wedding industry has boomed since the country emerged from the pandemic. Estimated at about $130 billion, it\u2019s now nearly twice the size of America\u2019s, although still smaller than that of China\u2019s, according to a report by Jefferies last month. \u201cAn otherwise value-conscious society, Indians love to spend on weddings,\u201d Jefferies said. \u201cAnd this is irrespective of the economic classes.\u201d At about $15,000, the average Indian wedding costs more than\u00a0three\u00a0times the average annual household income. More than a status symbol Weddings can be expensive affairs in any country, but in India they are especially important as symbols of power and status. Parents in South Asia typically spend a significant portion of their lifetime savings on their children\u2019s weddings, but the scale of many of these events has now become gargantuan, coinciding with India\u2019s rise as an economic powerhouse. \u201cIn the last decade there has been a big shift in Indian weddings across the board,\u201d said Sima Taparia, a\u00a0marriage consultant\u00a0who became a household name in the country after starring in the hit Netflix docuseries \u201cIndian Matchmaking.\u201d It is now common for wealthy Indians to host big weddings at exotic destinations abroad and invite Bollywood actors or famous musicians to perform, she added. \u201cThe Indian wedding is about the power of contacts, the power of relationships and the power of wealth,\u201d said Aditya Motwane, an events planner who founded Motwane Entertainment & Weddings and worked on the wedding of actress Priyanka Chopra\u00a0and singer Nick Jonas\u00a0in 2018. \u201cYou show everyone you know that you\u2019ve arrived in life through these kinds of celebrations,\u201d he added. Indian weddings are often spread across several days, with an average guest list of 326, compared with 115 in the United States, according to The Knot Worldwide. The scale is exponentially\u00a0bigger when it comes to the affluent, whose weddings involve thousands of guests, foreign locations and expensive gifts. Ambani\u2019s\u00a0three-day pre-wedding party in the western Indian city of Jamnagar in March was\u00a0attended by around 1,200 high-profile guests, including Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates. It is not uncommon for the very wealthy to spend many millions on the festivities. At the Ambani party, an elaborate light show featuring 5,500 drones lit up the sky above a glass palace custom-built for the festivities, where guests danced to a performance by none other than Rihanna. The outrageously rich also come up with some unusual requests. One couple asked Motwane to arrange for an elephant \u2014 a sacred animal to Hindus \u2014 to be in Monte Carlo to bless them. With India set to become the world\u2019s third-largest economy by 2027, extravagant weddings are expected to become even more frequent. According to a report from real estate consultancy Knight Frank, the number of Indians with a net worth of at least $30 million will rise by 50% over the five years to 2028, the biggest increase of any country. And, lower down the economic ladder, by 2030 some 600 million Indians are projected to be middle-class, a segment that will represent over 80% of the country\u2019s spending power. \u201cAs the middle class grows, so does their disposable income, which inevitably is spent on lavish parties and celebrations,\u201d said Tina Tharwani, co-founder of wedding planning company Shaadi Squad. Rihanna, couture and emeralds The average luxury Indian wedding can cost anywhere between $200,000 and $400,000, according to Jefferies. This kind of budget allows for accommodation at five-star hotels across the world, sumptuous catering, decor and entertainment, and sometimes includes Bollywood actors or international singers. But the Jefferies cost estimate does not include expenses on jewelry or attire. Bridal spending accounts for over half of the total jewelry market it India, the bank noted. The country is one of the largest markets for gold, but its appetite for diamonds and other precious gems is also growing. The emerald necklace worn by Nita Ambani, the groom\u2019s mother, at the festivities in March stunned the internet with its size and sparkle. No luxury Indian wedding\u00a0is complete without\u00a0lavish meals, which at times involves flying in Michelin star chefs and the finest of ingredients from across the world. An extra layer of expense is often added to the budget because many Indians don\u2019t eat meat, and some avoid root vegetables as well. Motwane recalls planning a wedding in Florence where many guests did not eat garlic or onion. The Italian cooks \u201chit the roof,\u201d he said. A renowned Indian Italian chef and her team were then flown in. A range of other businesses are poised for growth as Ambani-style high-profile weddings lead to a \u201ctrickle-down effect,\u201d setting \u201cnew trends and standards (and) influencing couples\u2019 expectations,\u201d said Tharwani, who worked on Indian cricketer\u00a0Virat Kohli\u2019s wedding in Tuscany. Vanessa Almeida, who looked after packaging and delivery of some 8,000 gifts for Ambani\u2019s guests at the jamboree in March, told CNN that similar party favors are becoming sought-after across the country. Of the many expensive\u00a0presents that the family showered upon its A-list guests \u2014 from silver candle sticks and shawls to\u00a0terrariums and bird houses \u2014 customized leather products\u00a0are among those that have caught on, said Almeida, owner of The Gift House in Goa. Demand for wedding videographers has also boomed in the last decade, with companies charging as much as $10,000 for a film. Many couples also shoot pre-wedding videos, which are painstakingly choreographed and\u00a0inspired by Bollywood musicals. \u201cBrides and grooms go for pre-wedding shoots across the globe,\u201d said Taparia. Local economy The rise in opulent celebrations held abroad has led to some consternation among the local communities, wedding planners say. In late May, the Ambanis held a four-day Mediterranean cruise for friends and family, with a bevy of Bollywood stars and performances by Katy Perry, the Backstreet Boys and Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli. Not everyone was impressed. The partygoers drew the ire of residents in the port city of Genoa, according to media reports, as they kept several neighborhoods awake with loud music until dawn. But, despite the occasional inconvenience, such functions also generate revenue and employment in the area. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a minimum of 2-3 million euros coming in over three days,\u201d said Motwane. The Indian government is now trying to get a bigger chunk of the luxury wedding revenue, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi launching a \u201cWed in India\u201d campaign to encourage affluent families to get married in the country. \u201cPeople often spend significant amounts of money to get married abroad,\u201d Modi said in March. But by hosting weddings in India, \u201cfamilies can enjoy lavish celebrations for three to four days, providing livelihood opportunities for locals.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/business/ultra-rich-indian-weddings-economy-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_business_trump-media-stock-truth-social-russell", "text": "If you\u2019ve got money in the market, you might own a little piece of Trump Media \u2014 without even knowing it. Trump Media & Technology is now part of two broad indexes of US stocks: the Russell 1000 Index of large-cap stocks and the Russell 3000 Index. And several popular passive funds \u2014 namely index and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) \u2014 automatically buy whatever shares are part of those Russell indexes. Trump Media (DJT), the owner of conservative social media platform Truth Social, announced its addition to the Russell family on Monday. The company, majority-owned by former President Donald Trump, doesn\u2019t make money and generates very little revenue. As a result, countless retail investors will now own a piece of Trump Media. \u2018Whether they know it or not\u2019 Passive investing in ETFs and other funds has surged over the past 20 years as a way for investors to cheaply diversify their holdings and avoid the risk of focusing on single stocks. Some large funds track the investment results of the Russell 1000. These include ETFs like the iShares Russell 1000 ETF (IWB), with nearly $38 billion in assets, and the $5 billion Vanguard Russell 1000 ETF (VONE), as well as certain mutual funds that are in 401(k) plans and other retirement accounts. These include the $14 billion iShares Russell 3000 ETF (IWV) and the $2.5 billion Vanguard Russell 3000 ETF (VTHR). \u201cPeople might be owning some of that company, whether they know it or not \u2014 and whether they like it or not,\u201d said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. That said, Trump Media would only be a small part of funds that track the Russell. It would be dwarfed by the holdings of larger companies including Microsoft, Nvidia and Apple. However, Stovall said the Trump Media situation underscores one of the disadvantages of passive investing: Some funds mimic indexes that automatically add stocks based on rules, not based on a careful evaluation of the business\u2019s fundamental strengths and weaknesses. \u201cYou can end up with real dogs that, in my opinion, are not really worthwhile owning. The flotsam gets swept up with the jetsam,\u201d Stovall said. In this case, the Russell 3000 captures the 3,000 largest US stocks. During annual updates, certain stocks are added \u2014 not necessarily because of their earnings potential or the quality of their products, but because they are large enough to qualify. \u201cInvestors seeking to capture a strategy reflecting broad US equities performance can confidently choose the Russell 3000 knowing there are no subjective inclusion or exclusions of stocks,\u201d according to FTSE Russell\u2019s website. Inclusion in the Russell 3000 automatically qualifies a stock to enter either the small-cap Russell 2000 or the larger Russell 1000. Some other indexes include subjective, more analytical criteria. For instance, S&P Global says it invites companies to join its S&P MidCap 400 index only after reviewing their balance sheets and financial viability. Experts have raised significant concerns about Trump Media, which is valued at nearly $6 billion even though it generated less than $1 million in revenue during each of the past two quarters. Its main product, Truth Social, is still a very tiny player in social media. Trump Media has been frequently compared to a meme stock that trades on momentum and hype, not fundamentals. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a vocal critic of former President Donald Trump, believes Trump Media is really worth just $40 million. \u201cThe Truth Social numbers are so absurdly out of the realm of normal business,\u201d Hoffman told CNN. Aniket Ullal, head of ETF data and analytics at CFRA Research, notes that regulators require all indexed ETFs to publish their portfolio holdings daily. \u201cThere is transparency in the holdings for investors who want it,\u201d said Ullal.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/business/trump-media-stock-truth-social-russell/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_media_biden-mental-fitness", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s White House repeatedly and aggressively shot down reports\u00a0on\u00a0the president\u2019s age and any possible limitations\u00a0on his ability to perform all the duties of his office. But after his shaky debate performance last week, in which Biden routinely struggled to\u00a0get his point across, some in the White House press corps say they wish they had pushed harder to tell the story. In June, when the Wall Street Journal published a\u00a0lengthy piece\u00a0on President Joe Biden\u2019s mental\u00a0state, the newspaper\u00a0got\u00a0slammed.\u00a0The White House, its allies, and\u00a0some in the media\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources\u00a0\u2013\u00a0criticized the Journal for quoting mostly Republican political foes on the record, who had a clear political motive to damage Biden\u2019s image. No Democrats were quoted on the record making those allegations, and several Democrats complained their on-the-record quotes praising Biden\u2019s sharpness were not included. The\u00a0Journal defended its reporting at the time. Last week\u2019s debate on CNN laid bare many of the concerns the Journal\u2019s reporting had raised \u2013 that the president has good days and bad days but can sometimes seem to slip up. A New York Times report on Tuesday raised similar concerns by those who have recently been in the room with Biden. The Times reported Biden has more frequent \u201clapses,\u201d although at other times he appears sharp. After Biden\u2019s lackluster performance last week, some are questioning whether the White House press corps dropped the ball on fully covering Biden\u2019s limitations. Biden\u2019s\u00a0age issue is not secret or new. Nearly every media outlet has reported on\u00a0growing concerns about\u00a0Biden\u2019s age well before the debate. The White House in the past has complained that the coverage is disproportionate, and that the media is spending more time covering Biden\u2019s age than his accomplishments as president versus former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies. The media has faced accusations that it has not covered Biden\u2019s mental fitness more aggressively because it wants to prop up the campaign in some way \u2013 an accusation the White House reporters CNN spoke to denied. Several White House reporters\u00a0told CNN that\u00a0the\u00a0coverage\u00a0of Biden\u2019s age and his mental stamina\u00a0should have\u00a0pushed harder. They cited several difficulties in doing so before the debate \u2013 from the obvious political motivations of sources who either want to protect Biden\u2019s image or project a certain image, to the blowback from pursuing such reports, especially from the White House and Democrats. A difficult task Like all past presidents, Biden has good days and bad days. It\u00a0can be tricky to report on something as difficult to define as a person aging, when his opponent\u00a0is a convicted felon, who regularly lies and has threatened to use the government to go after his political opponents. Still, some reporters said the press corps\u00a0could\u00a0have done a better job\u00a0covering\u00a0Biden\u2019s physical and mental state. The failure of the media, one White House reporter said,\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0pushing more aggressively\u00a0into Biden\u2019s abilities after the release of the Robert Hurr report in February, which called Biden a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d Biden\u2019s age was also a right-wing talking point for years, something the White House was quick to point out to reporters,\u00a0which\u00a0may have inadvertently turned off any serious investigation. For example, deceptively edited clips of Biden from the G7 spread widely by right-wing media figures were made to seem as though he was aimlessly \u201cwandering off\u201d from fellow world leaders when really, he was speaking to parachutists who had just landed during a demonstration. \u201cThe right-wing media was calling him senile from day one, and that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cThen whenever you report on the age you were in some ways solidifying, giving credence to some people that were actually of bad faith.\u201d All the White House reporters who spoke to CNN for this piece chose to speak anonymously so they could speak more freely about their relationship with the White House. Keeping the president at a distance Reporters said the White House has not made the press corps\u2019 job easy:\u00a0The White House has put up guardrails around Biden, they say, and\u00a0he does not engage in as many interviews or planned press conferences\u00a0as previous presidents. At those events,\u00a0the press might be able to gauge how he\u2019s doing on the spot, without prepared remarks. \u201cThey keep him at arm\u2019s length, and he rarely does extended interviews,\u201d the reporter said of the White House,\u00a0although he acknowledged Biden has started giving more interviews as of late. Biden has done fewer interviews and formal press conferences than his most recent predecessors, according to data compiled by\u00a0Martha Joynt Kumar,\u00a0professor emerita of political science at Towson University who chronicles the presidents\u2019 interactions with the press. But on quick and informal interactions with the press, like shouted questions on the way to his helicopter or plane, Biden\u00a0as of this week has had 588 interactions, Kumar reports, second only to Trump when compared to recent presidents. But those interactions are not the same as an extended press conference, reporters noted. On Tuesday, ABC News announced Biden would sit down with George Stephanopoulos for an interview, his first since the debate. The White House press shop has also been very \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cfairly successful\u201d in mitigating coverage of concerns over the president\u2019s age,\u00a0said\u00a0another White House reporter who works for a different publication. \u201c[B]erating reporters who bring them reporting about age concerns, bemoaning that it\u2019s all anyone writes about (clearly, it\u2019s not) and often attacking pieces after they run,\u201d the reporter told CNN. \u201cI think that\u2019s left some folks to conclude that these stories are too painful to report or that they should pick their spots more. It\u2019s clear the age stories that have angered the White House (and the liberal Twittersphere) the most.\u201d Alex Thompson, a White House reporter for Axios, said on CNN the day after the debate that \u201cthe White House\u2019s response every single time\u00a0it\u00a0has come up for three-and-a-half years has been to deflect, to gaslight, to not tell the truth \u2013 not just to reporters, not just to other Democrats, but even at times to themselves about the president\u2019s limitations at his age.\u201d Still, this White House\u2019s recent conduct with reporters pales in comparison to Trump\u2019s team, which has done everything from revoking press access to reporters they disagree with, to calling reporters the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d The White House declined to comment. Aging doesn\u2019t happen all at once Aging is also not a sudden moment.\u00a0That makes it trickier to report on. \u201cTo some extent, the decline has appeared to be gradual \u2014 hard to notice from day to day \u2014 and that\u2019s perhaps made it harder for reporters to determine when is the right moment to write something,\u201d one of the reporters said. Just a few days before the debate, Biden held a press conference at the G7 alongside Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelensky that passed off without anything of note in Biden\u2019s demeanor. But reporters pointed out (and have published stories noting) that the president has been using teleprompters at most big events, even fundraisers where in the past he might not have. He has also started to use the lower stairs to board Air Force One. Last year, The New York Times published a lengthy piece on the \u201ccomplicated reality of America\u2019s oldest president,\u201d which looked at some of those accommodations and concerns for his age, but also the moments where he showed stamina and vigor. Some reporters said that there has been a distinct change\u00a0within the last year, and that the press corps should have reported more aggressively on the accommodations made for the president. \u201cI think the press, most of the White House press, did suffer from a bit of lack of curiosity,\u201d one of the reporters said. Look who you\u2019re up against Biden\u2019s allies will often question coverage of the president\u2019s age, questioning why reporters focus on the president\u2019s age and mental lucidity and not on Trump\u2019s\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who, at 78,\u00a0was observed falling asleep during his hush money trial, has made his own major verbal flubs and bizarre statements, and regularly spouts complete falsehoods. \u201cIt makes sense to reflect on this now and ask whether we missed or, really, under-reported the story of Biden\u2019s age and decline. But it\u2019s complicated,\u201d one of the reporters said. \u201cThe fact that the political alternative to Biden is an authoritarian who sparked an insurrection and is a convicted felon does not mean that the press is failing American democracy to focus on Biden\u2019s obvious frailty.\u201d One of the reporters said the media can, and do, report on both. Biden\u2019s allies, however, say too much attention is placed on Biden\u2019s age and not on the threat Trump could pose to American democracy. But the reporters say they can, and should, do both. \u201cJust because you are reporting on Biden age, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not reporting on Trump\u2019s lies.\u00a0 I find that argument silly, and it seems one design towards like producing a certain outcome in the election, rather than like an honest reporting,\u201d one of the reporters said. The outlets that had received harsh blowback for their previous reports on Biden\u2019s lucidity now feel justified. A source familiar with the staff behind the Wall Street Journal\u2019s report said that when the piece first published, the reporters were approached by people with sympathy asking how they\u2019re doing \u201cas if something terrible had just happened,\u201d the source said. After the debate, the reporters started to get messages saying they were right.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/media/biden-mental-fitness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_04_23_cars_electric-vehicle-sales-forecast-iea", "text": "Global electric vehicle sales are set to rise by more than a fifth to reach 17 million this year, powered by drivers in China, according to the International Energy Agency. In a report Tuesday, the IEA projected that \u201csurging demand\u201d for EVs over the next decade was set \u201cto remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport.\u201d It expects half of all cars sold globally to be electric by 2035, up from more than one in five this year, provided charging infrastructure keeps pace. The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs. The agency\u2019s bullish long-term outlook for EVs \u2014 based on current government policies \u2014 comes just days after the world\u2019s biggest battery EV maker Tesla slashed its prices in major markets to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers. Recent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The data \u201cdoes not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars. It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday. The growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers. The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union rose almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. In a statement, Birol said: \u201cRather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.\u201d Despite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats. In the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the world\u2019s biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States. Earlier this month, Tesla posted its first annual drop in sales in nearly four years. The company\u2019s stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year. China\u2019s BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023. Automakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the \u201cpace of the transition to EVs\u2026 will hinge on affordability.\u201d In China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average. \u201cIntensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,\u201d the IEA said. \u201cGrowing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,\u201d it added. Last year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market. \u201cChina is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,\u201d Birol said. Concerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an investigation late last year into China\u2019s state support for EV makers. The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the region\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW. EV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country. By 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA. That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year. \u201cThis shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,\u201d Birol said. The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector. In addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States. Under current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA.

{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_business_electric-nascar-race-car-unveiled", "text": "NASCAR racing is all about loud, fast cars burning gas and rubber around a track. But on Saturday, NASCAR unveiled something different: an all-electric SUV that has twice as much horsepower as any of their current gas guzzlers. It\u2019s a sign of just how far electric vehicles have come that even a sport better known for its adherence to tradition is entertaining embracing the technology \u2013 even if, for now, the new car is just a prototype. In some ways, it looks like what you\u2019d expect from NASCAR. It\u2019s colorful with big wheels and a wing on the back to help the vehicle hold the road at high speeds. But, if NASCAR is known for anything, it\u2019s the loud V8 internal combustion engines that power the race car. NASCAR executives insist they have no plans to turn away from fuel-burning power any time soon. \u201cThe combustion engine is our core product, and that will remain so for the coming future,\u201d said Riley Nelson, NASCAR\u2019s head of sustainability. But this vehicle, a fully drivable prototype, provides a way for NASCAR to gauge fan interest in electric cars. The racing crossover has three electric motors \u2014 one driving the front wheels and two the back \u2014 capable of producing a maximum of 1,300 horsepower, almost double the horsepower of NASCAR\u2019s current gasoline-powered race cars. Some passionate NASCAR fans will, no doubt, reject the very idea of electric racing, said John Probst, NASCAR\u2019s senior vice president of racing development. That\u2019s why NASCAR wants to make it very clear that gasoline-burning race cars are in no immediate danger of extinction. This is also an opportunity to open minds to what could be something exciting in the future. NASCAR\u2019s own research with fans indicated that many are curious to know more about electric vehicles and could see EV racing as a way to learn about them, he said. Once fans see the speed and excitement of an electric cars, which can be more powerful and faster than gas cars, he thinks even the most anti-EV fans will drop some of their objections. The NASCAR EV prototype was built in cooperation with ABB, a company that\u2019s involved in building electric vehicle infrastructure, such as power equipment for chargers. ABB is also heavily involved in Formula E, the electric racing series affiliated with Formula 1. Involvement in racing like this hopefully generates interest in EVs and shows what they\u2019re capable of, said Michael Plaster, ABB\u2019s executive vice president for electrification in the US. The hope is that exciting track performance can sell electric cars. NASCAR introduced a broader initiative last year to reduce its overall net carbon emissions to zero by 2035. Racing itself represents only a small part of the organization\u2019s overall carbon emissions, said Nelson. For now, most of that initiative has to do with reducing emissions from office space, transportation and operations at the 15 NASCAR-owned tracks. \u201cThe pilot programs that we\u2019ve implemented within operations of our core business, and then also the events, has been going really well,\u201d she said, \u201cand we know where we need to go but we\u2019re still in the early stages of this journey.\u201d Currently, NASCAR cars run on fuel that is 85% gasoline and 15% ethanol but, in the next few years, NASCAR plans to announce a more sustainable racing fuel that can still be burned in loud V8 engines. The original idea behind NASCAR, the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, was that it was supposed to involve cars similar to what Americans drive on the road. With many changes over the years, modern NASCAR race cars bear little resemblance to the Toyotas and Chevrolets that typical Americans own. This time, designers wanted to maintain that resemblance between the race car and the vehicles fans drive, which are, increasingly, SUVs. Today, traditional cars \u2014 as opposed to SUVs, trucks or vans \u2014 make up less than 20% of US auto sales, according to Cox Automotive. \u201cWe actually have the opportunity to evaluate not just the battery electric part, but then also the crossover vehicle part,\u201d said Probst. \u201cSo, it may be that one or both of these will become something in the future for us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/business/electric-nascar-race-car-unveiled/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_13_success_gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy", "text": "Employees\u2019 negative daily emotions and lack of well-being can ultimately hurt worker engagement \u2013 and the economy, according to a new report released this week. Gallup, in its \u201cState of the Global Workplace,\u201d estimates that low employee engagement costs the global economy $8.9 trillion, or 9% of global GDP. The report includes findings from its latest annual World Poll, which surveyed 128,278 employees in more than 140 countries last year. That poll found that roughly 20% of workers globally reported feeling lonely, angry or sad on a daily basis. And 41% on average say they feel stress. Those most likely to say they feel lonely were younger workers (22%), employees who worked remotely full-time (25%) and those who felt most disengaged on the job (31%). While work isn\u2019t always the cause of a person\u2019s negative daily emotions, employers should still be concerned. That\u2019s because work can either improve or worsen employees\u2019 well-being. On the one hand,\u00a0the Gallup report noted,\u00a0\u201cwhen employees find their work and work relationships meaningful, employment is associated with high levels of daily enjoyment and low levels of all negative daily emotions. Notably, half of employees who are engaged at work are thriving in life overall.\u201d On the other, researchers found that being disengaged at work can negatively affect a person\u2019s wellbeing as much as \u2014 or more than \u2014 not having a job at all. \u201cEmployees who dislike their jobs tend to have high levels of daily stress and worry, as well as elevated levels of all other negative emotions,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOn many wellbeing items (stress, anger, worry, loneliness), being actively disengaged at work is equivalent to or worse than being unemployed.\u201d Engaged managers help workers thrive The poll found that last year only 23% of employees were engaged at work, unchanged from the year prior. Gallup defines an engaged employee as someone \u201chighly involved in and enthusiastic about their work and workplace. They are psychological \u2018owners,\u2019 drive performance and innovation, and move the organization forward.\u201d But those who said they were not engaged rose by 3 percentage points to 62%. These are employees characterized as \u201cpsychologically unattached to their work and company. Because their engagement needs are not being fully met, they are putting time but not energy or passion into their work.\u201d Engagement levels are highest in so-called \u201cbest practice\u201d organizations, where three-fourths of managers on average are engaged as well as seven in 10 non-managers, Gallup said. Their best practices include leaders\u2019 emphasizing well-being at work and in life; and putting a high priority on manager hiring and development. The manager piece of the equation is especially crucial. \u201c[W]hen managers are engaged, employees are more likely to be engaged,\u201d the report said. And, it added, \u201chigh-engagement business units are likely to see significantly higher employee wellbeing \u2014 as well as higher productivity, profitability and sales \u2014 than low-engagement teams.\u201d Where the most and least stressed workers are Engagement and well-being results varied in each of the 10 regions covered by Gallup\u2019s poll. The report noted that the United States and Canada, for example, showed the highest percentage of engaged employees (33%) among all the regions studied; and the third highest percentage of thriving employees (53%), behind Australia and New Zealand (60%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (54%). But the US and Canada also ranked second among employees experiencing daily stress (49%), right behind the Middle East and North Africa (52%). By contrast, Europe showed the lowest level of employee engagement (13%). South Asia scored lowest in terms of employees described as thriving overall (13%). And countries in post-Soviet Eurasia ranked lowest in terms of daily stress (19%).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/success/gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}

The decision is the latest in a string of production layoffs by the farm-equipment manufacturer over the past year. Deere has sought to reposition itself as a technology company amid falling agricultural revenue in the United States. \u201cThese changes are being made due to reduced demand for the products produced at these facilities,\u201d the company told CNN in a statement Friday. \u201cTo better position Deere to meet future demand, we continue to take proactive steps to reduce production and inventory.\u201d The company has reported slumping year-over-year revenue after announcing a net income of more than $10.16 billion in 2023. In a May earnings call, executives forecast Deere\u2019s 2024 income will be about $7 billion, citing higher production costs, lower shipment volumes and volatile weather that has made customers more cautious in their purchasing decisions. \u201cWe do expect incremental demand decline in the back half of 2024,\u201d Josh Beal, the company\u2019s director of investor relations, said in the May earnings call. \u201cNotably, our production volumes will decline more than demand in the back half as we\u2019re taking proactive steps to drive down field inventories. This is true for all of our major markets, South America, Europe, and also now for North America large tractors. We believe this approach best positions us to build the retail demand in 2025.\u201d Diminishing demand comes as US farming has faced significant headwinds over the past several years. According to the Department of Agriculture, in 2023 there were 1.89 million farms in the United States, a decline of 7% from the 2.04 million in 2017. In February, the USDA forecast net farm income in 2024 will fall by $43 billion, about 27%, after reaching a record high in 2022. Crop and animal product sales are also expected to generate $21 billion less in revenue this year, according to the USDA. At the same time, manufacturing jobs across the country have plateaued at 13 million employees after recovering from a sharp pandemic-related downswing in 2020, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Specifically, machinery manufacturing, which include jobs that produce agriculture and construction equipment, has seen a decline of about 9,000 employees since the beginning of the year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/business/john-deere-mass-layoffs-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_success_saving-under-high-interest-rates", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is an updated version of an article that originally ran on May 1. As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged for its seventh meeting in a row on Wednesday. People carrying variable-rate debt like credit cards and those seeking a loan won\u2019t be happy given that the Fed\u2019s rate, which directly and indirectly affects consumers\u2019 borrowing costs, remains at a 23-year high. Those rates will likely stay high for a while. At this point, only one cut is seen as likely before the end of the year, according to US central bankers\u2019 latest summary of economic projections. But whenever the cuts start, they may be small. \u201cAbsent a complete about-face from the economy, interest rates aren\u2019t likely to come down soon enough, or fast enough, to provide meaningful relief to borrowers. Utilize zero-percent credit card balance transfer offers, shop around for lower fixed-rate personal loans and home equity loans, and channel as much income as possible toward paying down this debt as quickly as possible,\u201d said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com\u2019s chief financial analyst. But the Fed\u2019s decision leaves savers, once again, in the catbird seat when it comes to making money on their money. \u201cSavers are enjoying the best returns on savings accounts and CDs in more than 15 years, with the most competitive offers outpacing inflation. In addition, these conditions are poised to persist for the foreseeable future,\u201d McBride said. Online high-yield savings accounts The best bang for your savings can still be had in online high-yield savings accounts at FDIC-insured banks, which yield way more than today\u2019s 0.58% overall average savings rate. As of June 11, the average online savings account rate was 4.40%, according to DepositAccounts.com. And many online high-yield accounts continue to offer rates of 5% or more. Say you have $10,000 in savings. If you leave it parked in a regular savings account at 0.5%, you\u2019ll get $50 in interest for a year. If you put it instead in a 5% high-yield account, you\u2019ll get $500. A high-yield savings account is the best place to park money you\u2019ll need to cover emergencies as well as anticipated large expenses that you have to pay in the next three months to a year. As with any savings account, banks can lower the rate they offer \u2014 also known as the APY \u2014 at any time. And you can be sure they will do just that when the Fed looks like it will finally start cutting rates, McBride said. But, he added, since rates are likely to be cut in small increments, online high-yield savings accounts may continue to offer inflation-beating returns for some time. \u201cThey will still offer the best way to preserve your [money\u2019s] buying power,\u201d McBride said. Money market accounts and money market funds Money market deposit accounts and money market mutual funds are generating yields competitive with the best high-yield savings accounts. But there are important differences. Money market deposit accounts are bank products. So, assuming your bank is FDIC insured, your account is too. (Or, if your account is at a federally backed credit union, your money will be\u00a0insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.) As with high-yield accounts, you may get the best deals at an online bank. But money market accounts may have a higher minimum deposit requirement than a high-yield account. Money market funds, by contrast, are an investment product \u2014 they generate return by investing in short-term, low-risk debt instruments and are currently yielding an average of 5.12%, according to the Crane 100 Money Fund Index. Such funds are a good place to park cash you have in your brokerage account that you may want to use at some point to buy equities or bonds, McBride said. Money market funds are not FDIC-insured, but any brokerage you use should be insured by the\u00a0Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which\u00a0covers your funds up to a limit if your brokerage ever goes under. Certificates of deposit CDs are still a great place to park any money you can leave untouched for a fixed\u00a0period of time \u2014 anywhere from a few months to five years or longer. As of June 11, the average rate was 4.971% on an online one-year CD, and 3.815% on a five-year CD, according to DepositAccounts.com. While your brick-and-mortar bank may offer a CD at a good rate, you may get a better one shopping around. The easiest way to do that without having to set up an additional account at another bank is to shop for CDs through your online brokerage, which is likely to offer a wide array of CDs from many different banks. At Schwab.com, for instance, CDs on offer ranging in duration from three months all the way up to 10 years offered average annual returns over 5%, with most ranging between 5.30% and 5.45%. The highest annual average was 5.56% for a three-month CD. If you have to withdraw money before the end of a CD\u2019s term, you can always get all of your principal back but may forfeit some of the interest earned as an early withdrawal penalty. Treasury bills and notes Beyond deposit accounts, investing in short-term Treasury bills and intermediate-term Treasury notes has been another way to earn a competitive return with virtually no risk since Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Treasury bills come in six different maturities: 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 13 weeks, 17 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks. Treasury notes mature in two, three, five, seven or 10 years. \u201cAs long as the Fed holds its rate in the 5.25% to 5.5% range, we expect most Treasury bill yields to hover around 5.25% as well,\u201d said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. But, Martin added, \u201cWhile the timing of rate cuts has been pushed back, we still expect them to arrive later this year, and investors in short-term investments would likely face reinvestment risk.\u201d That\u2019s why he suggests investors consider buying some intermediate-term investments now before rates are cut if they want to lock in a higher yield for some of their money, such as Treasury notes maturing in the next four to 10 years. On Wednesday, yields on Treasury bills were north of 5% and yields on Treasury notes were north of 4%, according to Schwab.com. When deciding whether it makes sense to invest in a CD or a Treasury for the same duration, you might opt for the Treasury if you live in a high-tax state, McBride suggested, since interest on Treasuries is\u00a0exempt from state and local taxes. In all instances, the easiest way to purchase Treasuries and other bonds is to do so through your brokerage account.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/success/saving-under-high-interest-rates/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_economy_americans-harder-to-find-job", "text": "Job seekers have been calling the shots for nearly four years as employers struggled to fill millions of openings to meet an onslaught of demand coming out of the pandemic. Many employers couldn\u2019t even require that workers return to offices, fearing they would quit. And if those workers did end up leaving, they\u2019d most likely find another job that suited their preferences pretty quickly. Plus, there was a good chance they\u2019d even earn more money by switching jobs, too. But the tide is starting to turn. Suddenly, the red-hot labor market is feeling closer to lukewarm for job seekers. The unemployment rate rose to a three-year high of 4.1% in June, with 6.8 million people unemployed. At that time a year ago, the unemployment rate was at 3.6% and 6 million people were unemployed. The rising unemployment rate \u2014 driven primarily by more people entering the workforce \u2014 means that it\u2019s getting more competitive for job hunters to get hired. It\u2019s just one of several signs of the changing narrative in the labor market. \u201cWe went from, \u2018How is the job market defying gravity?\u2019 to \u2018Let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t hit the ground any faster,\u2019\u201d Luke Pardue, policy director at the Aspen Institute\u2019s economic strategy group, told CNN. Pay increases are leveling off Economists have been closely watching the pace at which workers are leaving their jobs, since it serves as a signal for workers\u2019 willingness to test the labor market\u2019s waters. The quits rate has held steady at just 2.2% for seven months running, after reaching 3% during the pandemic. When people switch jobs, that typically can correlate to bigger pay bumps. which, in turn, potentially could make it more difficult to rein in inflation. Job-switchers\u2019 pay raises have pared down significantly from the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d period, according\u00a0to a newly released analysis\u00a0from Bank of America. In fact, median pay raises are just below 2019 levels, David Tinsley, senior economist at the Bank of America Institute, told CNN. \u201cPeople are still moving between jobs at a slightly faster rate than they were pre-pandemic \u2026 but the pay raises they\u2019re getting when they make those moves is a degree softer,\u201d he said. \u201cThat sort of suggests that the pendulum has swung slightly more in favor of firms and away from workers.\u201d People are staying unemployed for longer As the pace of hiring has slowed, people are staying unemployed longer. The median duration of unemployment jumped higher last month, to 9.8 weeks from 8.9 weeks in May, and landed at a level not seen since January 2023, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. That aligns with a recent trend seen in Labor Department jobless claims data. Continuing claims for unemployment benefits, which are filed by people who have received benefits for at least a week or more, rose to 1.858 million during the week that ended June 22, marking their highest level since November 2021, according to Labor Department data released last week. Initial claims, which are considered a proxy for layoffs, have been steadily rising as well. As of the week ended June 29, the four-week average of first-time claims was at 238,500, its highest level since August 2023. Despite the recent upswing in unemployment duration as well as the unemployment rate, it\u2019s important to note the historical context: The median unemployment duration is in line with what was seen in 2019; and the jobless rate remains below historical averages. Some industries are laying off more workers than they\u2019re hiring Even though there was a net positive number of people hired last month, totaling 206,000, there weren\u2019t universal jobs gains across all industries. In fact, several industries shed more jobs than they added. Among those were retail and manufacturing, where employment declined by 9,000 and 8,000, respectively. The biggest declines came from professional and business services \u2014 an umbrella sector that includes accountants and people who work in marketing. The industry employed 17,000 fewer people last month compared to May. That drop was driven by a whopping 49,000 fall last month in the number of temporary help services workers, a sub-sector of professional and business services. The temporary help category is often closely watched by economists as it could serve as a forward-looking economic data point in an otherwise lagging indicator: If companies are growing, they\u2019ll often get temporary help until they can hire for a full-time position; but if times are tougher, the temp workers usually are the first to go. Since 2022, the temporary help sector has added jobs in only four months. Still, the drop-off in June is the biggest since April 2021. The sharp decline in temporary help may be a sign that future weakness is ahead for the labor market this summer, Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, wrote in commentary issued Friday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/economy/americans-harder-to-find-job/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_business_smartmatic-reid-hoffman-fox-news", "text": "LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman is providing significant financial firepower to Smartmatic as the voting technology company fights Fox News and Newsmax over the right-wing networks\u2019 repeated airing of 2020 election lies. Hoffman, a billionaire venture capitalist and prominent Democratic donor, framed his multimillion-dollar investment in Smartmatic as a way to strengthen the company\u2019s global operations as it pursues the costly defamation lawsuits. \u201cSmartmatic built a global business by using technology to better engage citizens, regardless of party or ideology, by making voting simple and trustworthy,\u201d Hoffman said in a statement. \u201cAfter Donald Trump lost in 2020, however, Smartmatic became a target of the defamatory campaign to overturn his defeat.\u201d Hoffman, who said he has known Smartmatic CEO Antonio Mugica for years, said he is \u201cthrilled\u201d to support Smartmatic and help Mugica recover \u201cwhat he is owed.\u201d Terms of the investment, first\u00a0reported\u00a0by The Washington Post, were not disclosed. A\u00a0person with knowledge of the matter wouldn\u2019t say exactly how much money Hoffman poured into Smartmatic but told CNN the eight-figure investment surpassed $10 million. \u201cThis isn\u2019t litigation financing,\u201d the person said, adding that Hoffman \u201cthinks the company is massively undervalued\u201d and will make money off his investment if Smartmatic does well in the future. Furthermore, while Hoffman\u2019s investment is significant, he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the power\u201d to order Smartmatic\u2019s lawyers to settle the lawsuits, the person added. \u201cFox\u2019s strategy was to spend us into the ground,\u201d the person said. \u201cThis is the response.\u201d The investment comes as\u00a0Hoffman steps up his criticism\u00a0of Trump. The\u00a0LinkedIn co-founder told CNN\u00a0earlier this month that business leaders are scared to speak out against Trump for fear that the presumptive Republican nominee will retaliate. Hoffman argued that President Joe Biden is the more \u201cpro-business\u201d candidate because he respects the rule of law and Trump does not. Mugica, the Smartmatic CEO, welcomed the support from Hoffman. \u201cThe lies told by Fox News and Newsmax have not only defamed and damaged our business, they have also directly attacked the integrity of the nonpartisan civic work we have supported over more than two decades,\u201d Mugica said in a statement. Smartmatic is seeking billions of dollars in damages from Fox News, Newsmax and other right-wing figures that falsely accused the company of rigging the 2020 election. On social media and in TV interviews, top Donald Trump allies repeatedly claimed, with no proof, that Smartmatic software fraudulently flipped millions of votes from Trump to Biden. The voting technology company\u2019s defamation lawsuit\u00a0against Fox News\u00a0is still in the fact-finding \u201cdiscovery\u201d phase and isn\u2019t expected to go to trial until 2025. Earlier this year, the New York judge overseeing the case\u00a0allowed\u00a0Smartmatic to broaden its lawsuit to include Fox Corporation, the parent company of the cable news juggernaut. The Smartmatic-Newsmax lawsuit is\u00a0slated for trial in September\u00a0in Delaware Superior Court, unless there is a last-minute settlement. And the small pro-Trump propaganda network\u00a0One America News recently\u00a0settled a\u00a0lawsuit brought by Smartmatic\u00a0over similar allegations. All of these media outlets and Trump allies deny wrongdoing. A spokesperson for Fox News Media claimed Smartmatic is trying to \u201cto chill First Amendment freedoms\u201d with its lawsuit, \u201cso their alliance with a high profile Democratic donor and longtime supporter of President Biden to fund their lawsuit is entirely predictable.\u201d \u201cWe remain ready to defend this case surrounding extremely newsworthy events when it goes to trial next year,\u201d the spokesperson added. In response to Hoffman\u2019s investment, a Newsmax lawyer told CNN that the company \u201creported fairly on both sides of the 2020 election.\u201d The lawyer also noted that Smartmatic executives were recently\u00a0implicated by the Justice Department\u00a0in a bribery scheme involving a top Philippines election official. Smartmatic denies the allegations. Smartmatic is also suing Trump 2020 campaign lawyer Sidney Powell and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell \u2013 two of the most egregious peddlers of election disinformation. A representative for Powell did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \u201cIt seems that Mr. Hoffman is trying to take a page out of the Fox settlement, and copying Staple Street\u2019s investment in Dominion, to get a quick return,\u201d Lindell attorney Christopher Kachouroff said, referring to the private equity firm that owns a majority stake in Dominion and benefitted from its $787 million settlement with Fox News.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/business/smartmatic-reid-hoffman-fox-news/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. New data shows weakening in the US economy \u2013 Friday\u2019s jobs report showed that unemployment ticked up to 4.1% in June. Credit card delinquencies and debt are also on the rise. Consumers, who represent about two-thirds of the economy, are shopping less. But investors don\u2019t seem to mind it. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit new record highs on Friday following the release of the employment report. All major indexes closed out the shortened trading week higher, and the S&P 500 is up a staggering 17% thus far year-to-date. So what gives? One simple explanation lies within the hallowed halls of the Federal Reserve\u2019s HQ in DC. Inflation is easing, and so is economic growth \u2013 that combination means interest rate cuts could be on their way. Some analysts think there\u2019s more to it. These numbers represent a return to a more normalized pre-pandemic economy. Traders love normal. But there could be some surprises coming as the election landscape in the US heats up and President Joe Biden faces tough questions in recent days about the viability of his reelection campaign. Before the Bell spoke with Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede, about investors, the economy and political landscape. Before the Bell: Markets barely reacted to Friday\u2019s jobs report. Were you expecting that? Michael Reynolds: It seemed like a non-event for markets because it\u2019s a status quo continuation of trends that have been ongoing and a normalization of the labor market. The Fed has an estimate of what it calls the natural rate of unemployment. What that means is that in a steady-state economy where things are well-functioning without a lot of disruptions, you should expect about a 4.2% rate of unemployment if you\u2019re at full employment. We started the year at 3.7%, and we\u2019ve been drifting higher to that natural rate. Some people are pointing to that as a deterioration in the labor market, but we think that\u2019s a little misguided given that we had such an abnormal labor market for a long period of time, throughout the pandemic, and post-pandemic. You should expect to see this drift upwards if the economy is normalizing. How did the jobs number play into expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts later this year? We like to look at average hourly earnings, which are important given that the service sector is still seeing elevated inflation rates and wages are a big component of that. We saw a 0.3% increase there month-over-month, which is a little softer than it was last month. Things are moving in the right direction. Are we ready to declare mission accomplished on getting inflation under control? Certainly not. But we\u2019ve started to see some really encouraging results, especially out of last month\u2019s consumer price index report, which was basically flat. This week we\u2019ll get another CPI report, and that\u2019s going to be really front and center. The Fed is going to be watching it very closely to see if last month was an outlier or the start of a new trend. Our expectation is two rate cuts this year is base case. September is probably going to be the first \u201clive meeting\u201d where rate cuts are a real possibility. But there\u2019s still a lot to be seen until then \u2013 a few more inflation reports, a few more jobs reports that the Fed will have to react to. How sure are you about September? When I circle September I\u2019m using a pencil instead of a pen, because I might need that eraser. Inflation has shown a couple of false starts in getting back to that 2% target. What\u2019s giving us a little bit more comfort this time is that the services side is really coming down, and we didn\u2019t see that in the false start in 2023. How are you feeling about the health of the consumer? How is that impacting markets? If you look at some of the underlying components of this jobs report, the number of employed persons actually increased, even though the unemployment rate increased. What happened is your denominator increased, more people joined the labor force this month. So I don\u2019t see this report as a headwind at all to the consumer, there are more people working and more people looking for work. That\u2019s a good sign in an economy like this. But there is some risk to the consumer in this period. We\u2019ve been looking at things like excess savings built up over the pandemic. That\u2019s largely been spent through, that cushion is largely gone. That means that consumers have just a normal level of saving in aggregate. The other thing we\u2019re looking at is delinquency rates on credit cards, especially the interest rates being charged on those credit cards, as a potential warning sign. It seems a nascent warning sign, that it\u2019s something to be watching. We don\u2019t see that as an imminent risk to the consumer right now. We recognize that to have a thesis on the economy is to have a thesis on the consumer. The consumer makes up two thirds of all economic activity, but, as it stands now, we think the consumer, in aggregate, is still at a pretty healthy point right now. It seems like you\u2019re feeling pretty optimistic, but there\u2019s always room for an October surprise. How do you think the market would react to big election news? There are reports circulating that President Joe Biden is weighing dropping out of the presidential race.\u00a0 Markets have a discounting mechanism, and over the past year and a half, the markets have had opportunities to hear from the two major candidates about their policy initiatives and start to price that in over time. In a hypothetical scenario where we\u2019re looking for a new nominee for a major party, the market\u2019s going to have to do that on an accelerated timeline, not just game out all the different possible candidates that could take the mantle but also try to figure out what those candidates stand for. There\u2019s going to be an accelerated process of vetting candidates, not just for political purposes, but the market is going to want to vet their ideas as well and start to game out the probabilities. We\u2019ve got tax cuts expiring next year. What do these candidates want to do in that case, what is their take on tariffs? We almost always see higher volatility going into elections. That could especially be the case this year. Diaper change: Japan\u2019s aging society is transforming the baby care business The world\u2019s population is getting older in what the\u00a0United Nations\u00a0calls an \u201cirreversible global trend,\u201d driven by longer lives and smaller families. The number of people aged 65 and older is expected to more than double to 1.6 billion globally by 2050, according to a UN report published last year. In Japan, this change is threatening one of the world\u2019s largest economies as the percentage of older people grows and fewer couples have children. In early June, the country said the number of babies born fell for the eighth straight year, hitting a\u00a0record low\u00a0of 727,277 births in 2023 since Japan started compiling data more than 120 years ago. A few months earlier, Japan said that\u00a0one in 10 people were aged 80 or older,\u00a0making it the oldest country in the world. Last year, almost 30% of the Japanese population was 65 or older. In June 2023, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida unveiled a\u00a0multi-billion dollar package\u00a0of measures to encourage families to have more children. Japan is trying to tackle a demographic crisis that could impact pension funding and health care as\u00a0the workforce shrinks and demand from the aging population surges. The growth of the older population is also changing the consumer product market. Demand for adult diapers in Japan has been rising, while the need for baby diapers has fallen. The global market value for adult diapers was pegged at $12.8 billion in 2023, according to market research provider Euromonitor International. It is expected to reach almost $15.5 billion by 2026. In Japan, the adult diaper market stood at $1.7 billion in 2023, and is expected to grow to $1.9 billion in 2026, accounting for more than 12% of the global total. One example of a company adjusting to this shift is Japanese manufacturer Oji Holdings, which announced in March it would stop producing baby diapers for the Japanese market later this year to focus on incontinence products for adults. The company will continue to run its overseas baby diaper business, it said. Their combined baby diaper sales in China, Indonesia and Malaysia have grown despite a slowdown in the domestic market, where the company sold 7.3% more diapers for adults than babies in 2023.

{"id": "2024_07_08_business_china-eu-brandy-import-probe-intl-hnk", "text": "Beijing has intensified its anti-dumping investigation into imports of European brandy. The Chinese commerce ministry will\u00a0hold a hearing on July 18 to discuss\u00a0the\u00a0probe into claims that European producers are selling brandy in China at artificially low prices, according to a statement from the ministry Friday. The hearing will focus on the reasons behind lower prices and any damage they\u2019ve caused to the Chinese liquor industry, the ministry said. The announcement came on the same day as the European Commission\u2019s additional provisional tariffs on imports of Chinese-made electric vehicles came into effect. The tariffs, ranging from 17.4% to 37.6%, are seen as a necessary move by the EU to deter a flood of cheap Chinese cars built with what it deems unfair support from the government. On Saturday, the China Association\u00a0of\u00a0Automobile\u00a0Manufacturers, a state-backed auto association, said it was \u201cstrongly dissatisfied\u201d with the additional EU tariffs on Chinese EVs and considered them \u201cunacceptable.\u201d Major stakeholders are bracing for retaliatory moves by Beijing. China\u2019s probe into Europe\u2019s cognac is a tit-for-tat reaction to EU action on Chinese EVs, said Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer of LVMH (LVMH), at an economic conference on Saturday, according to a Reuters report. LVMH owns major cognac brand Hennessy. \u201cYou can be a regional player with a very particular role in globalisation, as in our case, and regardless find yourself hostage to a number of conflicts that have nothing to do with your activities,\u201d he said. French congac producers will be hit hard if China imposes any tariffs after the probe. Last year, 99% of China\u2019s imported brandy came from France, reaching $1.74 billion in value, according to Chinese customs data. The Chinese government announced the anti-dumping probe against European brandy in January, in what was seen as a retaliation against the EU\u2019s decision to investigate whether Chinese EV manufacturers receive unfair state subsidies. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, announced last month that it would hike tariffs on Chinese EVs. Talks between the two sides are expected to continue but, if no agreement is reached, the tariffs will become definitive in November. The tariffs would become definitive in November if no alternative resolution is reached. Beijing has said it will take \u201call necessary measures\u201d to safeguard China\u2019s interests. Apart from brandy, such measures could include retaliatory moves against imports of EU pork. \u201cChina has already launched a targeted anti-dumping probe on pork imports. The findings of an investigation into EU spirits are due early next year but could come anytime,\u201d said Bank of America analysts in a research note Monday. \u201cBeijing has warned it could hit European agricultural goods, aviation and cars with large engines,\u201d they added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/business/china-eu-brandy-import-probe-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_media_biden-stephanopoulos-interview-campaign", "text": "ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos had a tall task on Friday: Press President Joe Biden on his age, his acuity and the future of his reelection campaign. It was one of the most anticipated interviews of his career. Stephanopoulos mostly lived up to the challenge, asking rapid-fire, biting questions that did not let Biden off the hook. Although there was no single standout moment, Stephanopoulos challenged Biden\u2019s denialism about the political damage the president did to himself during his disastrous debate performance last week. Behind his questions, viewers got a sense of Stephanopoulos\u2019 frustration, which is shared by the entire White House press corps. Many of the journalists who cover Biden every day are seething; angry at what some say is a White House that has deceived them, and has kept the president from interacting in an open format with the press. In the interview, Biden\u2019s first since the CNN debate last month, Stephanopoulos kept the questions going at a fast clip. He was measured but persistent, clearly aware of the deeply personal and sensitive issues at hand. But he also sometimes seemed almost in disbelief at Biden\u2019s answers. \u201cDo you really believe that you\u2019re not behind right now?\u201d he asked Biden, questioning him again and again over polling. \u201cJust when you look at the reality though, Mr. President,\u201d he implored again. Stephanopoulos pressed Biden the most on whether he has had, and whether he would agree to a neurological and cognitive evaluation, asking him about it five times in a row. At some point Stephanopoulos painted a stark reality for the president. \u201cIt\u2019s been a two-man race for several months. Inflation has come down. In those last few months, (Trump has) become a convicted felon. Yet, you\u2019re still falling further behind,\u201d he said. And then an even more brutally honest take. \u201cMr. President, I\u2019ve never seen a president (at) 36% approval get reelected,\u201d he said. The interview only lasted about 22 minutes and was aired unedited. So any and all pauses, stumbles and even some production issues (like a\u00a0camera losing focus when Biden leaned forward) were bared for all to see. Although the interview did not necessarily have any earth-shattering moments, it was important for the Biden campaign to try to halt the negative whirlpool around it. Stephanopoulos was asking questions not just for ABC and the American public, but also for an entire White House press corps that\u2019s been urgently requesting access to the president and a press conference \u2014 thus far to no avail. Praise for Stephanopoulos Stephanopoulos was widely praised by fellow journalists. \u201cI think Stephanopoulos\u2019s questions are mostly good and tough so far,\u201d Jonah Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Dispatch, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. Josh Jamerson, deputy politics editor at the Wall Street Journal, wrote, \u201cGeorge Stephanopoulos, incredibly impressive interviewer tonight. Not grandstanding at all. Just straight-forward questions.\u201d And New York Times reporter Kenneth Vogel noted Stephanopoulos was \u201cpersistent & tough, but not mean.\u201d \u201cHis toughest questions were delivered with empathy,\u201d Vogel added. The interview \u2014 while important \u2014 will likely do little to quell the crisis in the Democratic Party over Biden\u2019s candidacy, but also little to quell the frustration of the White House press corps, which has been demanding a press conference with the president. Biden has given the fewest press conferences of any modern president, although he rates highly for number of quick informal questions and answers with reporters. Stephanopoulos knows intimately well what the White House needed to do with this interview, having been on the other side as a communications director for former President Bill Clinton. During the 1992 presidential campaign, after reports surfaced that then-candidate Clinton had had a mistress, both Bill and Hillary Clinton sat for a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview to air after the Super Bowl. Writing in his memoir years later, Stephanopoulos recalled: \u201cWe bet a whole campaign on a single interview.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/media/biden-stephanopoulos-interview-campaign/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_business_boeing-doj-criminal-charges", "text": "Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to one charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States\u00a0for its role in two fatal 737 Max crashes,\u00a0the Justice Department said in a court filing Sunday evening. It represents yet another black eye for the company after a series of embarrassing safety blunders, but the agreement avoids what could have been more serious consequences. \ufeffIt will pay up to $487 million in fines \u2014 a fraction of the $24.8 billion that families of crash victims wanted the aircraft maker to pay. The families of victims of two fatal crashes of the 737 Max oppose the deal, the department said. The guilty plea is a severe blow to the reputation of Boeing, a company once known for the quality and safety of its commercial planes. Beyond the fatal crashes of the 737 Max jets, the company has faced a series of questions about the safety and quality of its planes.\u00a0In January, a door plug on a 737 Max flown by Alaska Airlines blew out early in a flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet and further damaging Boeing\u2019s reputation. The agreement stipulates that Boeing will have to operate under the oversight of an independent monitor \u2013 a person to be chosen by the government \u2013 for a period of three years. But that oversight and the fine did not satisfy the families of victims, according to one of their attorneys. \u201cThis sweetheart deal fails to recognize that because of Boeing\u2019s conspiracy, 346 people died,\u201d said a statement from Paul Cassell, a law professor at the University of Utah who represents many family members of the\u00a02018 Lion Air crash\u00a0and\u00a02019 Ethiopian Air crash\u00a0victims. \u201cThis deceptive and generous deal is clearly not in the public interest,\u201d he added. The families are seeking a public trial on the charges.  Justice Department defends deal The Justice Department argues that the penalties Boeing agreed to were the most serious available. It argued it won other improvements as well, including the oversight of a monitor and the demand that Boeing spend more on safety and compliance of rules when building aircraft. \u201cThis resolution protects the American public,\u201d said the DOJ\u2019s statement. \u201cBoeing will be required to make\u00a0historic investments to strengthen and integrate its compliance and safety programs. This criminal conviction demonstrates the department\u2019s commitment to holding Boeing accountable for its misconduct.\u201d The statement also raised the possibility of more legal problems ahead for Boeing and its executives. It said that while no individuals face criminal charges as a result of this agreement, \u201cDOJ is resolving only with the company \u2014 and providing\u00a0no immunity to any individual employees, including corporate executives, for any conduct.\u201d \u201cDOJ is resolving with Boeing only for misconduct that predated the 737 Max crashes \u2014 and\u00a0not providing immunity for any other corporate conduct, including the Alaska Airlines 1282 incident,\u201d it added. While no one was severely injured in that flight, CNN has confirmed that passengers and crew on that flight have received notice that they might be considered victims of a crime. But family members of victims from the two fatal plane crashes blasted the plea agreement early Monday. \u201cMiscarriage of justice is a gross understatement in describing this,\u201d said a statement from Zipporah Kuria of England who lost her father, Joseph, in the Ethiopian Airlines crash. \u201cIt is an atrocious abomination. I hope that, God forbid, if this happens again the DOJ is reminded that it had the opportunity to do something meaningful and instead chose not to.\u201d \u201cWithout full transparency and accountability nothing will change,\u201d said a statement from California resident Ike Riffel, who lost his two sons, Melvin and Bennett, in the crash. \u201cWith this deal, there will be no investigation, there will be no expert witness testimony, there will be no perpetrators of these crimes to answer the charges in court.\u201d \u201cThe penalties and conditions imposed on Boeing as a result of this plea deal are not substantively different than those that failed to change Boeing\u2019s safety culture and that resulted in the Alaska Air door blowout,\u201d said aerospace engineer Javier de Luis, who lost his sister Graziella in the second crash. \u201cWhen the next crash happens, every DOJ official that signed off on this deal will be as responsible as the Boeing executives that refuse to put safety ahead of profits.\u201d Boeing issued a brief statement saying only that it can \u201cconfirm that we have reached an agreement in principle on terms of a resolution with the Justice Department, subject to \u2026 approval of specific terms.\u201d Boeing investors appeared pleased by the terms of the deal. Shares of Boeing (BA), a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, were up 3% in morning trading. A design flaw hidden from regulators According to the charges, the company defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the process of certifying the 737 Max to carry its first passengers. The plane started service in 2017, but the two fatal crashes led to a 20-month grounding of the jets. Investigations revealed a design flaw in its autopilot system. Boeing has admitted responsibility for the fatal crashes, and that its employees withheld information about the design flaw from the FAA during certification. In January 2021, the federal prosecutors and Boeing reached an agreement to settle criminal charges and defer any prosecution on the matter. During a three-year probationary period that followed, Boeing agreed to improve its quality issues and transparency with the government. But the Alaska Airlines incident came just days before that probationary period was due to end, which led to a series of federal investigations into its practices. In May, the DOJ said it was\u00a0looking into bringing criminal charges\u00a0against Boeing once again due to a potential violation of that January 2021 agreement. Boeing had argued in its own court filings that it did not violate the agreement and that it should be spared prosecution. Sunday night\u2019s guilty plea, which came just before a midnight deadline set by the Justice Department, settled that issue. Cost of the guilty plea Under the original 2021 agreement, Boeing had agreed to pay $2.5 billion. But about 70% of that amount represented payments Boeing had already agreed to make to its airline customers as compensation for the 20-month grounding of the planes. Another $500 million was a fund to compensate crash victims. Only $243.6 million represented a criminal fine to the government, which would be doubled after the new guilty plea. Boeing has also agreed to spend $455 million on its compliance and safety programs over the next three years, which the government said will represent a 75% increase over what the company was spending annually on those programs. The company\u2019s various problems have caused deep financial losses since the second fatal 737 Max crash. It has posted core operating losses of $31.9 billion since the start of the 20-month grounding. It is also at risk of losing its investment-grade credit rating for the first time in its history. The company now has nearly $47 billion in long-term debt, and if its debt rating is downgraded to junk bond status, its cost of borrowing money will soar. But an additional fine in the hundreds of millions, rather than the billions, is still affordable for the company, despite its financial woes. No loss of government contracts The company avoided another serious penalty \u2014 the loss of the right to conduct business with the government. Such a penalty would have been a crippling blow for the planemaker. About 37% of its revenue in 2023 came from federal contracts. According to Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace and defense management consultant, the possibility of such a penalty was minimal as both Boeing and the federal government are heavily reliant on each other. Despite its troubles over the last five years, Boeing is still a key component of the US economy. It remains the nation\u2019s largest exporter, and has nearly 150,000 US employees. The company estimates its economic impact at $79 billion, supporting 1.6 million direct and indirect jobs at more than 9,900 suppliers spread across all 50 states. Its only significant rival for commercial aircraft, European manufacturer Airbus, has a backlog of more than 8,000 jet orders, meaning any Boeing customer placing an order for an Airbus plane today would have to wait nearly a decade for it to be delivered. The fraud charges encompassed in Sunday\u2019s guilty plea, and the investigations into the Alaska Airlines incident, are hardly the only safety issues being raised about Boeing planes currently. The Alaska Air incident brought renewed attention to a series of events, large and small, raising safety concerns aboard Boeing jets. More than a dozen whistleblowers who work or worked at the company or its contractors have come forward in recent months to speak to Congressional investigators and the media about their concerns procedures and practices at Boeing. Allegations include knowingly using flawed parts on planes and assembly procedures that did not meet Boeing\u2019s own standards. In each case, Boeing said it investigated the allegations and addressed them appropriately. Those allegations and the Alaska Air incident have resulted in a steady drumbeat of safety issues and incidents getting attention that might never have gotten attention in the past. For example, the FAA is in the process of publishing a notice Monday to airlines about a problem with oxygen masks on 2,600 US airplanes, spread between the 737 Max and some older versions of the 737 which could cause problems with the masks dropping down to passengers if they are needed. The problem can be addressed by inspections, according to the notice. Boeing said it had no comment on the FAA\u2019s airworthiness directive language, which was issued after Boeing had already issued a service bulletin itself to airlines that own the jets.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}

The new tower will be built in Jeddah and developed in tandem with Dar Global, the international arm of Saudi mega-developer Dar Al Arkan. If completed, it appears the Jeddah tower would be the Trump Organization\u2019s first major project in Saudi Arabia. \u201cWe are thrilled to expand our footprint in the Middle East and bring the Trump standard of luxury to the region through our long-standing relationship with Dar Global,\u201d Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of former president Donald Trump, said in the announcement. Dar Global said the project will target the \u201cluxury Saudi Arabian market and international investors.\u201d The new project in Saudi Arabia comes just days after the Trump Organization and Dar Global unveiled a $500 million Trump International hotel complex in Oman. That five-star hotel complex, set to open in December 2028, would include a nightclub, golf course and members-only club. Dar Al Arkan has agreed to use the Trump name and logo under license for that hotel, which is not owned by the Trump Organization. The Trump Organization\u2019s new projects in the Middle East could raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest should former President Donald Trump return to the White House. \u201cThe Trump Organization\u2019s continued pursuit of foreign business projects raises perilous national security, corruption and constitutional concerns,\u201d Donald K. Sherman, senior vice president and chief counsel at the Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Washington (CREW), told CNN in a statement. \u201cThis is particularly true of their development in Saudi Arabia, whose government has a long history of apparently seeking to influence Donald Trump,\u201d Sherman added. \u201cIf Trump were to return to the presidency, he would likely violate the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, as he did repeatedly in his first term in office.\u201d A 2023 analysis by CREW found that Trump made at least $9.6 million from countries in the Middle East during his presidency. The Trump Organization is owned by a private trust that lists the former president as the sole beneficiary. The family business is run by his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. Last year, the Trump Organization was fined $1.6 million by a New York judge for running a decade-long tax fraud scheme. Two Trump entities were convicted of 17 felonies, including tax fraud and falsifying business records. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The investment firm run by Jared Kushner, the former president\u2019s son-in-law who helped advise on foreign policy during the Trump administration, reportedly secured a $2 billion investment from the Saudi royal fund. Last month, Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, launched an investigation into Kushner\u2019s firm and its ties to Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern governments. Wyden expressed concern that the investments in Kushner\u2019s firm could create \u201csignificant conflicts of interest and potential counterintelligence risks.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/business/trump-tower-saudi-arabia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_success_buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage", "text": "Moving somewhere new when you retire isn\u2019t uncommon. But deciding whether to take out a new mortgage to buy a home is a big deal. Much of your financial life is changing as you transition from a steady paycheck to a mix of fixed and variable income and a new lifestyle. So adding a large debt to the picture isn\u2019t an easy call. That\u2019s especially true now that mortgage rates hover around 7% and home prices keep rising. \u201cAny time you take on debt, you increase risk in your situation,\u201d said Illinois-based certified financial planner Jim Stork. More than a third (35%) of homebuyers last year were between the ages of 59 and 98, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Within that group, a majority financed their purchases. Whether taking out a new mortgage makes sense for you depends on a lot of factors, including how to prove to a lender that you\u2019re a good credit risk, plus your feelings about the debt and the ongoing cost of maintaining a home. To get a mortgage, your age won\u2019t be a factor, but your income will be If you\u2019re concerned that you may be less attractive to a mortgage banker because you\u2019ve hit retirement age, know that it is illegal to discriminate against anyone applying for a mortgage based on their age. Lenders\u2019 chief focus will be on your ability to repay your mortgage with your various sources of non-paycheck income. \u201cWhen you qualify for a mortgage, it\u2019s all based on your income,\u201d said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage. That, and of course any debt you have that will soak up your income, but we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. The income sources that lenders consider, absent a regular paycheck, include: Social Security benefits, pension or annuity income, spousal benefits, disability payments, interest and dividends and your 401(k) or IRA. If a portion of your income is not subject to tax, the lender may treat it as worth 25% more. Fannie Mae offers this example: Say 15% of a $1,500 monthly Social Security benefit is tax free. That means $225 of it will not be subject to tax ($1,500 x 15%). And 25% of that amount comes to $56 ($225 x 25%). So that $56 can be added to a person\u2019s qualifying Social Security income amount ($1,500 + $56 = $1,556). If you want to use your nest egg, different methods can be used to calculate how much income it would provide. There is the asset depletion method in which your eligible assets are divided by your loan term. In the case of a 30-year mortgage, that would be 360 months. If your IRA is worth $700,000, that translates into $1,944 per month ($700,000/360). \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to take the money out \u2014 but you can use your assets [to qualify for a mortgage] as if you were going to take the distribution,\u201d Cohn said. Another option: If you are at least 59-1/2, you can start taking monthly distributions from an IRA without penalty \u2014 or a 401(k) if your plan rules permit \u2014 and the lender will count that as income so long as you show that you have sufficient funds in the account to keep taking that same monthly distribution for three years. Once you close on your home, Cohn said, you can reduce or stop taking distributions if you choose. That assumes you are not yet in your 70s when the IRS requires you to start taking minimum distributions, said Mark Luscombe, a principal analyst at Wolters, Kluwer Tax & Accounting. Burdened by debt? Lenders will also assess your debt-to-income ratio, because no matter how much income you have, the big question is how much of it will be consumed by your debts. The debt portion is composed of your expected mortgage payment plus any credit card, student loan, car loan or other outstanding debt you may have. Generally speaking, for conventional loans your DTI ratio can be up to 50%, Cohen said. That ratio falls to between 43% and 45% if you\u2019re taking out a jumbo loan, she added. A jumbo loan exceeds the conforming loan limits in the area you want to buy. But ideally your debt level will fall well below these top limits, both for the lender\u2019s sake and yours. And, of course, the higher your credit score, the better the interest rate you can get on a mortgage. What you should consider before taking out a mortgage Even before seeking a mortgage, get a good grasp on your expected monthly income and expenses in retirement. Compared to pre-retirement earnings, \u201cMost (new retirees) see a decrease in income,\u201d said certified financial planner Lori Trawinski, director of finance and employment at AARP. While some expenses may also decline \u2014 e.g., work-related costs like commuting \u2014 others may increase over time, Trawinski said, like medical costs, property taxes, home insurance and utilities. Of course, you can downsize and move to a lower-cost area. But if you stay near where you lived during your career, your expenses are likely to rise over time. Also, Trawinski noted, if you\u2019re married, consider what will happen to your household income when one spouse dies. This will help you assess your future comfort level in carrying a mortgage. \u201cPeople often fail to plan for the death of a spouse. You can take a big hit to your income when that happens,\u201d she said. If you do move to a new state or region, weigh renting first. You can get a better sense of the cost of living in the area and decide whether it\u2019s a good fit for you. As Stork put it, \u201cFlorida in August is not as fun as Florida in January.\u201d How much are you really willing to take on? All the usual financial decisions that go into homebuying apply no matter your age. But, in retirement especially, you don\u2019t want to take on more debt than necessary, since the cost of a mortgage is fixed, but the returns on your investments, the housing market and your health needs are variable. At the very least, Stork said, consider whether you can put enough money down \u2014 at least 20% \u2014 to avoid having to pay private mortgage insurance. Beyond that, consider whether you feel comfortable keeping up \u2014 and paying for \u2014 maintenance on a home. Maintenance might amount to 2% a year of your home\u2019s value, Stork said. That amounts to $10,000 a year on a $500,000 home. Maintenance is essential in preserving the value of your house should you ever decide to sell. How would your mortgage interest rate compare to a reasonable rate of return on your investments? The decision to get a mortgage was a lot easier for retirees when rates were historically low \u2014 roughly 3% \u2014 and their nest eggs were earning a lot more. \u201cBut at today\u2019s rates it\u2019s a much harder calculation,\u201d Stork said. This is especially the case if you\u2019re a very conservative investor. \u201cIf your CDs are earning 4% and a mortgage would cost you 7%, you will lose money every day on that decision,\u201d Stork explained. To get the truest reading on what makes financial sense, compare mortgage expenses to your investment returns on an after-tax basis, Stork noted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/success/buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_success_money-problems-dementia", "text": "Financial files in disarray. Late payments and last-warning service-cutoff notices. Multiple daily bank withdrawals. Out-of-character purchases. When a family member who has been fairly responsible with money all their lives becomes careless with their finances, it may be one sign of as-yet-undiagnosed dementia. Researchers at the New York Federal Reserve who analyzed both US credit reporting and Medicare data found that in the five years before a dementia diagnosis, a person\u2019s average credit scores may start to weaken and their\u00a0payment delinquencies rise. \u201cThe harmful financial effects of undiagnosed memory disorders exacerbate the already substantial financial pressure households face upon diagnosis,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cBeyond susceptibility to payment delinquency, early stage [Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related disorders] may affect new account openings and debt accumulation, credit utilization, and/or credit mix.\u201d Their findings echo the results of a 2020 study from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \u2018Methodical\u2019 military spouse\u2019s record-keeping deteriorates Marcey Tidwell, who lives in Bloomington, Indiana, said those findings are \u201cnot remotely shocking.\u201d Tidwell\u2019s mother was diagnosed with a form of dementia in 2020 and has been living with her daughter ever since. Tidwell said that for most of her life, her mother was an \u201coutrageously methodical human being\u201d who kept the bills paid and the family records organized across many moves as her husband pursued a career in the military. After going through her mother\u2019s papers this year, Tidwell surmises that her mother\u2019s memory started faltering around 2015, because from that point forward her record-keeping became \u201cless than pristine.\u201d For example, Tidwell said, her mom used to keep an immaculate record of checks written and deposits and withdrawals made in her checkbook register. But that register became a mess. \u201cThere was a bunch of stuff scratched out and she was obsessively adding and re-adding \u2014 she knew things weren\u2019t all they could be. Later on, I saw that she took out large amounts of her savings, more than she needed for groceries.\u201d Former finance executive accrues piles of unpaid bills, finances new car he didn\u2019t need Karen Lemay, who lives in Ottawa, Canada, knew something was really wrong with her father in 2022 when she saw on his desk piles of late-payment notices and final-notification warnings from service providers and insurers. Her father was a former finance executive who \u201cwas very conservative with his money, very smart about it and never reckless with it,\u201d she said. And he had strongly impressed upon his daughter the importance of paying off her credit card in full every month to avoid interest. Yet Lemay discovered he owed $50,000 in charges, interest and late payment fees on a Visa card. He also financed the purchase of a new car he didn\u2019t need, just months before police took away his driver\u2019s license. Normally, he would only buy high-end used cars with cash, she said. What\u2019s more, his daughter noted, he failed to pay his 2021 taxes. So he ended up owing the government roughly $20,000, the bulk of which was for late payment and underpayment penalties. \u201cI spoke to him about some of his balances and he refused to believe he hadn\u2019t paid them,\u201d Lemay said. Two parents with dementia, one daughter\u2019s efforts to reduce financial worry Jayne Sibley, who lives in the United Kingdom, knows the pain and stress of dealing with the financial behaviors that can signal dementia. Her father and mother were both diagnosed with different forms of it. Her father moved into a nursing home years ago, but her now-deceased mother remained in her own home, albeit with live-in care. \u201cThe most challenging thing we faced was managing mum\u2019s everyday money as her condition progressed. She would overspend on things she didn\u2019t need or want. Random items, cleaning equipment, luxury food. She also fell victim to scams over the phone \u2014 a fake insurance policy, those sorts of things,\u201d Sibley said. Her mother also would take money out of the cash machine two to three times a day and give it to anyone who asked. Acutely aware of how high long-term care costs were, given her father\u2019s situation, Sibley said she worried that her mother would run through the money that would be needed for her own care. While her mother\u2019s condition made her vulnerable with money, she initially was still able to walk and shop and go to yoga on her own. In other words, she was able to maintain a lot of her autonomy and social ties. To try to stem the money outflow, Sibley and her brother tried doling out a week\u2019s worth of cash for their mother \u201cbut she\u2019d spend it all in one go,\u201d she said. Ditto when they tried divvying the cash up into daily envelopes. Eventually, they took away her cash card. But, soon after, her condition worsened, Sibley said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t able to maintain her familiar routines and social connections. That\u2019s when we realized there has to be a better way.\u201d With her husband, she founded Sibstar, which offers a debit card in the UK that can be used by a person with dementia to maintain some sense of financial autonomy and social engagement. When needed, family caregivers can monitor their debit transactions via an app. As a person\u2019s condition worsens, the caregiver can set limits on how much money can be spent on any given day or week, and where the card can be used (eg, at cash machines, online or at the grocery store). Early planning lessens some stress While there are few dementia-specific financial tools to reduce the odds that someone squanders their own hard-earned money, there are steps you can take to make it easier to assume control over another person\u2019s finances when they become incapacitated. In 2008, a year after her father died without a will and a dozen years before her mother was diagnosed with dementia, Tidwell said she and her siblings took their mother to a lawyer to make sure she had a will, named her medical proxy and named the person to whom she would give power of attorney to handle her financial affairs should the need arise. That made it easier for Tidwell, among other things, to get online access in 2018 to her mother\u2019s bank account to make sure nothing was amiss. By 2020, she had automated her mother\u2019s bill paying online. \u201cThe time to make plans is before you need to. It\u2019s hard to overstate what a gift that trip to the lawyer in 2008 was to \u2018future me,\u2019\u201d said Tidwell, who fully manages her mother\u2019s finances now that her condition has worsened considerably. Since dementia can worsen over time and because someone in the initial stages may not recognize they are more vulnerable to financial errors and scams, the US National Institute on Aging recommends that a family take steps early on to alleviate those concerns, such as setting up automated bill payments for the person with dementia. Of course, no amount of advanced financial planning can alleviate the heartbreak of watching a loved one with dementia decline. \u201cI prepared as best as I could, but it\u2019s still hard,\u201d Tidwell said. That\u2019s why she advises anyone potentially facing a similar situation to, in her words, \u201cmake the easy part easy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/success/money-problems-dementia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}

That\u2019s because the chain has concluded that when people go to McDonald\u2019s, they mostly want a burger and fries. \u201cIf people really want salads from McDonald\u2019s we will gladly relaunch salads,\u201d said Joe Erlinger, the president of McDonald\u2019s USA, in a June interview at the Wall Street Journal\u2019s annual Global Food Forum. \u201cBut what our experience has proven is that\u2019s not what the consumer\u2019s looking for from McDonald\u2019s,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for great french fries, they\u2019re looking for a $5 meal deal, they\u2019re looking for a hot fresh sandwich. And so, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to continue to provide them.\u201d Serving a healthy meal \u2014 or one fit for vegetarians, vegans or children \u2014 can help fast food chains avoid a so-called \u201cveto vote,\u201d which involves a group or family skipping a restaurant that doesn\u2019t have options for picky eaters or ones with dietary restrictions. For McDonald\u2019s, putting salads on the menu was likely a way to avoid the veto vote and stay atop recent healthy food trends. McDonald\u2019s had been serving salads for decades prior to the pandemic. Salads made it possible for some to eat at the chain while watching their diets (as one diet blogger noted, \u201cthe salads were the only half-healthy item\u00a0I could eat at McDonald\u2019s.\u201d) For others, it may have been more of a way to feel like they were eating healthy, even if they weren\u2019t. But in 2018, salads became more of a liability than a draw. That year, hundreds of people were sickened with an intestinal illness caused by consuming contaminated food or water. McDonald\u2019s salads were \u201cone likely source of these infections,\u201d the CDC said at the time. During the outbreak, the chain stopped selling its salads at 3,000 restaurants as a precautionary measure. And then, two years later, Covid hit, and restaurants facing labor shortages and tangled supply chains slimmed down their menus to focus on their most popular items. McDonald\u2019s removed salads from national menus in 2020 to help simplify restaurant operations, the company said. In 2022, the chain gave its franchise operators the option of serving pre-made salads but many decided not to, the Wall Street Journal reported. The strategy paid off. Sales ballooned as the chain came up with ways to update and market their core items. And now, the chain is focusing its efforts on convincing customers  to choose their $5 meal deal, rather than a competitor\u2019s, while the salad has been left behind. Another menu item that\u2019s not coming to McDonald\u2019s any time soon? A plant-based burger, which McDonald\u2019s tested a few years ago. \u201cI don\u2019t think the US consumer is \u2026 looking for McPlant or other plant-based proteins from McDonald\u2019s now,\u201d Erlinger said at the June conference, but added that \u201cit\u2019s a trend that we\u2019ll continue to monitor.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/business/mcdonalds-menu-salads/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_business_six-flags-cedar-fair-merger-rollercoaster", "text": "Six Flags this week completed an $8 billion merger with rival Cedar Fair to create the largest amusement park operator in the United States. Together, they operate 42 amusement and water parks across 17 states. The success of the deal will determine the future of these amusement parks, and diehard rollercoaster fans are watching carefully. Some are optimistic that the condition of Six Flags\u2019 parks will improve. Others worry it will become more expensive to get into their favorite parks. Many amusement park fans are passionate about the parks\u2019 design and history and notice the smallest of changes. For now, each park in the new company will keep its old branding and name. But fans fear the parks could lose their nostalgic elements and become a sea of corporate sameness. \u201cThere\u2019s apprehension,\u201d said Bill Kneass, who has been a Six Flags season passholder on and off (but mostly on) for 30 years, twisting through Nitro and Wonder Woman rides at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey. Kneass goes to the park with his sons and his friends. He also goes by himself sometimes to take in the roar of the coasters or find quieter spots around the park gardens. He highlights each visit with a trip to see the engraved brick he bought on a park pathway to commemorate Six Flags\u2019 50th\u00a0anniversary. \u201cIf the new Six Flags can find a way to honor the history of their parks and bring in new attractions for all types of enthusiasts, they\u2019re poised for success,\u201d he said. Chris Miller, who runs a YouTube channel about amusement parks called Coaster Conquest and co-hosts the Theme Park Stan podcast, is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the merger. \u201cI am hopeful that joining forces will help bring a variety of different new rides to parks that don\u2019t normally see updates,\u201d he said. But he is \u201cworried that the cost of an all-park season pass will be super expensive\u201d because of less competition. He also worries the \u201cbeautiful\u201d Cedar Fair parks will lose their distinct identities and become more like Six Flags. \u201cI hope they keep the parks as they are,\u201d he said. The new company, Six Flags Entertainment Corp., does not anticipate making any major changes at the park level, said spokesperson Gary Rhodes. Fans also should not expect any \u201cimmediate changes\u201d to prices, ticket options or season passes. \u201cWe expect this combination will enable us to deliver even more engaging and entertaining experiences to guests,\u201d he said. Six Flags struggles The two companies are joining to compete with destination parks such as Disney and Universal and to use their new scale to drive down costs with vendors and suppliers. People come from around the world to go to Disney parks, while Six Flags and Cedar Fair are regional attractions. Cedar Fair controls 51% of the new company, and Six Flags owns 49%. The company, with the stock ticker FUN, will be led by Cedar Fair CEO Richard Zimmerman. Six Flags has struggled in recent years, going through various management changes and strategies. Its stock has dropped 40% over the past five years. Six Flags hiked ticket prices in 2022, raising the average price of admission to $35.99 from $28.73. The move caused a 26% drop in annual attendance It was part of Six Flags\u2019 \u201cpremiumization\u201d plan to bring in fewer people to parks but get them to spend more. CEO Selim Bassoul complained in 2022 that Six Flags had turned into \u201ccheap day care centers\u201d for teenagers and said the company wanted to \u201cmigrate\u2026a little bit from what I call the Kmart, Walmart to maybe the Target customer.\u201d The shifting strategies impacted the experience at the park, Kneass said. Six Flags, he noticed, focused on adding thrill rides and overlooked smaller rides for kids and families and other park activities, such as evening entertainment and shows. Staffing at the park and customer service also became inconsistent. \u201cSix Flags can feel a bit disjointed,\u201d he said. \u201cFinances were more important than the guest experience.\u201d Attendance at Cedar Fair, which operates its flagship Cedar Point park in Sandusky, Ohio; Knott\u2019s Berry Farm in Buena Park, California; and other parks, outperformed Six Flags last year. Analysts and fans consider Cedar Fair a stronger manager of day-to-day park operations than Six Flags. That gives fans like Matt Kaiser, who runs the 23,000-member Facebook group Great Adventure Connoisseurs, optimism. \u201cA lot of people used to Six Flags parks are happy that they\u2019re merging and look forward to Cedar Fair behind the wheel,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople tend to think Cedar has better service.\u201d Potential changes The amusement park industry faces significant volatility, including the rising threat of extreme weather driven by climate change. Six Flags has said it\u2019s adding more shaded structures, water misters, splash zones and air-conditioned areas to contend with extreme heat. Merging makes the two companies less dependent on any one park or region if weather forces them to shut down. \u201cThey\u2019re so strategically laid out across the United States. There\u2019s not a lot of overlap,\u201d said Dennis Speigel, the chief executive of consulting firm International Theme Park Services. \u201cIf you take those parks and meld them together, you have tremendous marketing opportunities.\u201d Park enthusiasts could see other changes, including new season pass options and loyalty programs that give passholders access to more parks, said Chris Woronka, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. Retaining and growing season passholders is critical because they make up more than half of annual attendance for Cedar Fair and Six Flags\u2019 parks. The new company may also combine its intellectual property licenses at parks to design new themed rides and attractions. Six Flags has a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery for the rights to DC Comics and Looney Tunes characters, and Cedar Fair has the rights to Peanuts and Snoopy characters. (CNN is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.) It could mean, for example, that Looney Tunes rides are featured at both brands of parks. Halloween has become a primary visiting time for theme park fans, and there could be changes to these events. Cedar Fair hosts Halloween Haunt and Six Flags hosts Fright Fest. But Michael Musil, who lives in Bay Village, Ohio, and is a longtime Cedar Point visitor, worries that Cedar Point will suffer. \u201cSix Flags is going to corporatize it and budget out everything and end up with this very sanitized, fixed version of the amusement park,\u201d he said. \u201cThat might be great for the bottom line, but it would be boring.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/business/six-flags-cedar-fair-merger-rollercoaster/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/09/2024", "section": "business"}}
