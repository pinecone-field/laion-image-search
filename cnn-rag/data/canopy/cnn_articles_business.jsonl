In the lawsuit, filed Sunday in New York state court, the president\u2019s sonaccuses Fox News of unjust enrichment, intentionally inflicting emotional distress, and violating New York civil rights laws. The lawsuit makes good on\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s threat he made in April that he would take the network to court if it didn\u2019t immediately issue retractions and corrections. The miniseries, \u201cThe Trial of Hunter Biden,\u201d was a six-part offering on the Fox Nation digital streaming network, and was also promoted on Fox News, the cable TV channel. It featured a dramatized \u201cmock trial\u201d about Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas financial dealings that led in part to his federal tax indictment and that also fueled House Republicans\u2019 struggling impeachment inquiry into his father. Fox News\u00a0took down the miniseries\u00a0in late April, one day after Hunter Biden threatened to file a lawsuit. But according to the lawsuit, promotional materials for the miniseries are still on some Fox News-linked social media pages, and the miniseries episodes are still circulating \u201conline and in the public domain.\u201d A Fox News spokesperson claimed the lawsuit was meritless and \u201centirely politically motivated,\u201d and said the network looks forward to \u201cvindicating our rights in court.\u201d \u201cThe core complaint stems from a 2022 streaming program that Mr. Biden did not complain about until sending a letter in late April 2024,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe program was removed within days of the letter, in an abundance of caution, but Hunter Biden is a public figure who has been the subject of multiple investigations and is now a convicted felon. Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden\u2019s own making.\u201d The new lawsuit claims Fox News \u201ctargeted Mr. (Hunter) Biden in an effort to harass, annoy, alarm, and humiliate him, and tarnish his reputation.\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s son is seeking an unspecified amount of punitive damages, as well as any profits that Fox reaped from the miniseries, and other corrective measures. \u201cThe miniseries is fictionalized; it is not a news event. It was made for the purpose of trade and advertising, and merely exploits Mr. Biden\u2019s name, image, and likeness for Fox\u2019s commercial benefit,\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers wrote in the lawsuit. Hunter Biden\u2019s team said in the lawsuit that without his consent, Fox News \u201cunlawfully published numerous intimate images (both still and video) of Mr. Biden depicting him in the nude, depicting an unclothed or exposed intimate part of him, as well as engaged in sex acts.\u201d The right-wing network said these images originated form Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0infamous laptop\u00a0\u2013 data from which was leaked by allies for former President Donald Trump in 2020. The president\u2019s son was\u00a0convicted at a trial\u00a0last month on federal gun charges, and faces a second trial this fall on alleged tax crimes. However, he hasn\u2019t been charged in connection with the bribery and foreign lobbying allegations that were at the center of Fox\u2019s \u201cmock trial\u201d series.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/media/hunter-biden-sues-fox-news/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_07_business_john-deere-mass-layoffs-2024", "text": "John Deere announced it will lay off about 600 employees across three US factories as the Illinois-based company shifts production to a newly planned facility in Ramos, Mexico. Effective August 30, about 310 employees will be laid off at two Iowa-based plants in Dubuque and Davenport, as well as 280 from a factory in East Moline, Illinois. In total, the three factories have roughly 4,175 production and maintenance employees. The Illinois factory primarily produces harvesting equipment such as combines, while the two Iowa factories manufacture construction and forestry equipment. The decision is the latest in a string of production layoffs by the farm-equipment manufacturer over the past year. Deere has sought to reposition itself as a technology company amid falling agricultural revenue in the United States. \u201cThese changes are being made due to reduced demand for the products produced at these facilities,\u201d the company told CNN in a statement Friday. \u201cTo better position Deere to meet future demand, we continue to take proactive steps to reduce production and inventory.\u201d The company has reported slumping year-over-year revenue after announcing a net income of more than $10.16 billion in 2023. In a May earnings call, executives forecast Deere\u2019s 2024 income will be about $7 billion, citing higher production costs, lower shipment volumes and volatile weather that has made customers more cautious in their purchasing decisions. \u201cWe do expect incremental demand decline in the back half of 2024,\u201d Josh Beal, the company\u2019s director of investor relations, said in the May earnings call. \u201cNotably, our production volumes will decline more than demand in the back half as we\u2019re taking proactive steps to drive down field inventories. This is true for all of our major markets, South America, Europe, and also now for North America large tractors. We believe this approach best positions us to build the retail demand in 2025.\u201d Diminishing demand comes as US farming has faced significant headwinds over the past several years. According to the Department of Agriculture, in 2023 there were 1.89 million farms in the United States, a decline of 7% from the 2.04 million in 2017. In February, the USDA forecast net farm income in 2024 will fall by $43 billion, about 27%, after reaching a record high in 2022. Crop and animal product sales are also expected to generate $21 billion less in revenue this year, according to the USDA. At the same time, manufacturing jobs across the country have plateaued at 13 million employees after recovering from a sharp pandemic-related downswing in 2020, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Specifically, machinery manufacturing, which include jobs that produce agriculture and construction equipment, has seen a decline of about 9,000 employees since the beginning of the year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/business/john-deere-mass-layoffs-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

Although Biden has made several public appearances since the debate, he has read prepared remarks at those events. This will be his first off-the-cuff appearance since the debate.

The July 3 interview\u00a0with\u00a0WAUK-AM\u00a0host Earl Ingram\u00a0was one of Biden\u2019s first media engagements following his poor performance at the\u00a0June 27\u00a0CNN Presidential Debate. The revelations of the requested edits come as the press corps, frustrated by how the White House has handled their questions about Biden\u2019s health and acuity, is about to face Biden for the first time since the debate at a press conference Thursday during the NATO summit. On Thursday, Civic Media, a Wisconsin-based radio network, posted the edited clips and the entire unedited interview on its website. The edited clips, it said, included Biden saying: \u201c\u2026and in addition to that, I have more Blacks in my administration than any other president, all other presidents combined, and in major positions, cabinet positions.\u201d Another clip included the removal of a reference to former President Donald Trump\u2019s call for the death penalty for the so-called Central Park Five. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they even call for their hanging or not, but he\u2013but they said (\u2026) convicted of murder,\u201d Biden said. A Biden campaign spokesperson acknowledged it had asked the station to edit the interview. \u201cHosts have always been free to ask the questions and air the segments they think will best inform their listeners,\u201d the spokesperson said. Civic Media CEO Sage Weil\u00a0said in a statement that\u00a0the station was made aware on Monday that \u201cimmediately after the phone interview was recorded, the Biden campaign called and asked for two edits to the recording before it aired.\u201d \u201cGiven the gravity of the current political moment, the stakes in this election, and the importance of public scrutiny of public officials in the highest office, we believe it is important to share this information,\u201d Weil said. Weil said management determined that \u201cthe production team at the time viewed the edits as non-substantive and broadcast and published the interview with two short segments removed.\u201d He added that \u201cCivic Media disagrees with the team\u2019s judgments in the moment\u201d and that they are clarifying their internal polices \u201cto ensure that everyone in the organization understands the standards we expect for live and pre-recorded interviews.\u201d Despite the edits, Civic Media \u201cunequivocally stands by Earl Ingram and his team,\u201d saying that the edits were made in \u201cgood faith\u201d even if leadership at Civic Media \u201cdisagree with the decision.\u201d Earlier this week, another radio host, Andrea Lawful-Sanders,\u00a0resigned\u00a0from the Philadelphia station WURD after she told CNN that her\u00a0post-debate interview with President Joe Biden\u00a0included questions that were pre-selected by Biden\u2019s campaign team.

{"id": "2024_06_13_success_gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy", "text": "Employees\u2019 negative daily emotions and lack of well-being can ultimately hurt worker engagement \u2013 and the economy, according to a new report released this week. Gallup, in its \u201cState of the Global Workplace,\u201d estimates that low employee engagement costs the global economy $8.9 trillion, or 9% of global GDP. The report includes findings from its latest annual World Poll, which surveyed 128,278 employees in more than 140 countries last year. That poll found that roughly 20% of workers globally reported feeling lonely, angry or sad on a daily basis. And 41% on average say they feel stress. Those most likely to say they feel lonely were younger workers (22%), employees who worked remotely full-time (25%) and those who felt most disengaged on the job (31%). While work isn\u2019t always the cause of a person\u2019s negative daily emotions, employers should still be concerned. That\u2019s because work can either improve or worsen employees\u2019 well-being. On the one hand,\u00a0the Gallup report noted,\u00a0\u201cwhen employees find their work and work relationships meaningful, employment is associated with high levels of daily enjoyment and low levels of all negative daily emotions. Notably, half of employees who are engaged at work are thriving in life overall.\u201d On the other, researchers found that being disengaged at work can negatively affect a person\u2019s wellbeing as much as \u2014 or more than \u2014 not having a job at all. \u201cEmployees who dislike their jobs tend to have high levels of daily stress and worry, as well as elevated levels of all other negative emotions,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOn many wellbeing items (stress, anger, worry, loneliness), being actively disengaged at work is equivalent to or worse than being unemployed.\u201d Engaged managers help workers thrive The poll found that last year only 23% of employees were engaged at work, unchanged from the year prior. Gallup defines an engaged employee as someone \u201chighly involved in and enthusiastic about their work and workplace. They are psychological \u2018owners,\u2019 drive performance and innovation, and move the organization forward.\u201d But those who said they were not engaged rose by 3 percentage points to 62%. These are employees characterized as \u201cpsychologically unattached to their work and company. Because their engagement needs are not being fully met, they are putting time but not energy or passion into their work.\u201d Engagement levels are highest in so-called \u201cbest practice\u201d organizations, where three-fourths of managers on average are engaged as well as seven in 10 non-managers, Gallup said. Their best practices include leaders\u2019 emphasizing well-being at work and in life; and putting a high priority on manager hiring and development. The manager piece of the equation is especially crucial. \u201c[W]hen managers are engaged, employees are more likely to be engaged,\u201d the report said. And, it added, \u201chigh-engagement business units are likely to see significantly higher employee wellbeing \u2014 as well as higher productivity, profitability and sales \u2014 than low-engagement teams.\u201d Where the most and least stressed workers are Engagement and well-being results varied in each of the 10 regions covered by Gallup\u2019s poll. The report noted that the United States and Canada, for example, showed the highest percentage of engaged employees (33%) among all the regions studied; and the third highest percentage of thriving employees (53%), behind Australia and New Zealand (60%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (54%). But the US and Canada also ranked second among employees experiencing daily stress (49%), right behind the Middle East and North Africa (52%). By contrast, Europe showed the lowest level of employee engagement (13%). South Asia scored lowest in terms of employees described as thriving overall (13%). And countries in post-Soviet Eurasia ranked lowest in terms of daily stress (19%).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/success/gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

Joe Biden\u00a0is losing a particularly influential corner of support: Hollywood. On Wednesday,\u00a0George Clooney\u00a0became the latest \u2014 and perhaps most notable \u2014 member of the Tinseltown elite publicly to express misgivings about Biden\u2019s candidacy, calling on the embattled president to drop out of the 2024 race. \u201cI love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him,\u201d Clooney wrote\u00a0in a blunt piece\u00a0for\u00a0The New York Times. \u201cBelieve in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he\u2019s won many of the battles he\u2019s faced.\u201d \u201cBut the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can,\u201d Clooney added. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \u2018big F-ing deal\u2019 Biden of 2010. He wasn\u2019t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\u201d Clooney, a major Democratic donor and one of Biden\u2019s most high-profile supporters, concluded his piece by writing, \u201cJoe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.\u201d The unreserved take from Clooney added even more pressure on Biden to exit the race. More importantly, Clooney\u2019s candid assessment is representative of the mounting pressure Biden is facing out west, where his all-important and deep-pocketed support in Hollywood is quickly eroding. The potential loss of Hollywood spells major problems for the president, who has not only counted on the City of Angels for the strong surrogates it has offered him, but also for the film industry\u2019s ability to raise millions of dollars to power his campaign. In fact, the Hollywood fundraiser that Clooney headlined last month and referenced in his piece,\u00a0raised a staggering $30 million\u00a0\u2014 more than any other Democratic fundraiser in history. Now that crucial support is in flux. Since Biden\u2019s hard-to-watch performance at the CNN debate, a number of influential Hollywood voices have gone public with their concerns about his candidacy, with many calling on the president to exit the race. Director\u00a0Rob Reiner\u00a0shared Clooney\u2019s op-ed Wednesday on\u00a0X, writing that \u201cdemocracy is facing an existential threat\u201d and that Biden \u201cmust step aside\u201d to make way for \u201csomeone younger to fight back\u201d against Donald Trump.\u00a0Netflix\u00a0co-founder\u00a0Reed Hastings\u00a0told The Times\u00a0last week that Biden needs to \u201cstep aside.\u201d The\u00a0\u201cLOST\u201d\u00a0creator\u00a0Damon Lindelof\u00a0wrote a piece\u00a0for\u00a0Deadline, saying Biden \u201chas to go\u201d and urging fellow Hollywood denizens to stop writing checks until a new candidate is named. Disney heiress\u00a0Abigail Disney\u00a0also said\u00a0she would withhold donations until Biden is replaced. And\u00a0Endeavor\u00a0boss\u00a0Ari Emanuel\u00a0said at a conference that he was \u201cpissed off at the founding fathers\u201d for having never put an age limit on the presidency. \u201cDonald Trump said, \u2018I\u2019m the only one.\u2019 Right? \u2018I alone can make all these problems go away.\u2019 And now Biden is saying, \u2018I\u2019m the only one that can beat Trump.\u2019 Seems like it\u2019s pretty similar here, {but} we have a great bench in the Democratic Party,\u201d Emanuel said last week. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a man who\u2019s saying the other guy\u2019s a liar, and he\u2019s telling us malarkey!\u201d Turing the tide in Hollywood will be a difficult challenge for Biden, who is simultaneously struggling to keep Democratic members of Congress and governors from expressing concerns about his ability to defeat Trump and serve another term in office. I\u2019m told that the Biden campaign has actively been making phone calls to Hollywood supporters, working to maintain their support in this turbulent moment. As for Clooney, a senior Biden campaign adviser told me, \u201cPOTUS won\u2019t be sitting front row at \u2018Oceans 14.\u2019\u201d But, the person added, Biden is \u201cencouraged by the strong grassroots support we\u2019re seeing and he\u2019s determined to earn every vote and win this election.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/media/biden-hollywood-support-withdraw/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

Be My Eyes partnered with OpenAI last year to enable its AI model, rather than another human, see and describe what\u2019s in front of a user. In OpenAI\u2019s latest product demo, the company showed a clip of a person using the AI-powered version of Be My Eyes to hail a taxi \u2014 the app told the user exactly when to raise their arm for the car.

Applications for blind users are just one area where AI is helping to advance what\u2019s known as \u201cassistive technology,\u201d tools designed to help people who are disabled or elderly. Apple, Google and other tech companies have rolled out a growing slate of AI-powered tools to make life easier for people with a range of impediments, from eye-tracking tools that let physically disabled users control their iPhones with their eyes to detailed voice guidance for blind users of Google Maps. Since the stunning launch of ChatGPT more than a year ago, it has been clear that AI will change our world by upending how we work, how we communicate and even what we perceive as reality. But for people with disabilities, AI also has the potential to be life-altering in an entirely different way. \u201cIt used to be that if you were in business and you were blind, you had to have an administrative assistant reading to you,\u201d Sherwood said. \u201cBut now, you have this new power \u2026 For some, this is great technology. For blind people, this is an opportunity to gain employment and an opportunity to compete in business, an opportunity to succeed.\u201d The benefits of AI for accessibility Tech companies have been using early forms of AI to make their products more accessible for years \u2014 think, automated closed captioning on videos or screen readers. But experts say that the huge data sets and powerful computing systems behind more recent AI models are accelerating what\u2019s possible in the assistive tech space. For instance, in order for an AI tool to reliably help blind people hail taxis, it needs to be very good at recognizing what a taxi does or does not look like, which requires training the model on a huge corpus of examples. Another example: a Google tool that tells blind or low-vision users about what\u2019s on their screen, has been upgraded with a \u201cquestion and answer\u201d feature that incorporates the company\u2019s generative AI technology. \u201cThe promise of AI has been evident for many, many years but it has to reach this quality level before it can be a viable thing that you include in products,\u201d Eve Andersson, Google\u2019s senior director of product inclusion, equity, and accessibility, told CNN. New generative AI tools are especially promising for accessibility applications because they\u2019re designed to understand and produce information in various formats, including text, audio, photos and videos. That means if a person needs to consume information in a certain medium, AI can act as a go-between; for instance, turning a piece of audio into written text for a hearing-impaired user. \u201c(People\u2019s) accessibility needs take many different forms, but a large class of disabilities are really about input and output, it\u2019s about how a person perceives information,\u201d Andersson said. \u201cThere are hearing disabilities, vision, motor, speech, cognitive and all of these can involve a need for different modalities (of information) and one thing that AI is fantastic at is translating between modalities.\u201d Designing inclusive AI systems Ensuring that AI systems continue to serve all kinds of users requires ongoing investment. Because AI models are trained on human-created data, experts have warned that they may replicate the same biases present among humans. And early examples have already cropped up, including AI image generators that appeared to struggle with the concept of race, or an algorithm that allegedly showed job advertisements based on gendered stereotypes. In one effort to address that risk, a group of Big Tech companies, including\u00a0Apple, Google, Microsoft and others,\u00a0have partnered with researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign to create a training dataset for AI speech recognition tools that includes a diversity of speech patterns. Speech recognition tools, such as translators, voice assistants and voice-to-text apps can be especially important and useful for users with disabilities. The effort, called the Speech Accessibility Project, involves collecting recordings from volunteers with conditions such as Parkinsons, Down Syndrome, ALS and other disabilities that can affect speech. With the help of the project\u2019s now more than 200,000 recordings, a sample speech recognition tool created by the researchers misunderstands speech only 12% of the time, down from 20% prior to being trained on the new dataset. \u201cThe more diverse types of speech we can get into those machine learning systems and the greater variety of severity, the better those systems are going to be at understanding individuals that don\u2019t have \u2018audiobook narrator\u2019 speech,\u201d said Clarion Mendes, a speech language pathologist and clinical assistant professor who helps lead the project. \u201cI have talked to so many people throughout this project who face huge barriers to life participation because of their communication, individuals with impressive degrees who can\u2019t find employment because of their communication barriers,\u201d Mendes said. \u201cIf something like assistive technology can make it possible for individuals to find enrichment in their hobbies, in their jobs \u2026 all of a sudden these activities that used to take excessive amounts of time or require the person to rely on other individuals, that has increased their independence exponentially.\u201d Andersson added that investing in AI for accessibility is not just the right thing to do, it also makes good business sense. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to leave people behind \u2026 technology in general has the ability to level the playing field,\u201d Andersson said. \u201cBut there are also financial reasons like being able to sell your products to government entities, to educational institutions.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/tech/ai-assistive-technology-disabilities/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events.

According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_tech_apple-pay-europe-mobile-wallets", "text": "Apple has yielded to pressure by European regulators to give rivals access to the contactless payments technology on iPhones, meaning that their users will no longer be limited to the Apple Pay mobile wallet. The development on the tap-to-pay technology underscores mounting regulatory scrutiny of Apple (AAPL) in the European Union, where it is also facing a potential huge fine for allegedly breaching the bloc\u2019s landmark Digital Markets Act. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, announced this and other changes to Apple\u2019s business practices Thursday, saying they would open up competition in mobile payments on iPhones. \u201ciPhone users will (now) be able to use their preferred mobile wallet for payments in stores\u2026 while enjoying all the iPhone functionalities, including double click, tap-and-go and Face ID,\u201d the EU\u2019s competition chief Margrethe Vestager told journalists. The tech giant has until July 25 to implement the changes, which will remain in force for 10 years and apply throughout the 30 countries in the European Economic Area. Under the agreement, third-party mobile wallet developers will gain free access to the standard technology used for contactless payments with iPhones, known as near-field communication (NFC) technology. Apple will also allow iPhone users to choose which mobile wallet to make the default wallet on their phones. \u201cApple is providing developers in the European Economic Area with an option to enable NFC contactless payments and\u00a0contactless\u00a0transactions for car keys, closed loop transit, corporate badges, home keys, hotel keys, merchant loyalty/rewards, and event tickets\u00a0from within their iOS apps,\u201d Apple said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cApple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the European Economic Area for users and developers.\u201d The European Commission first raised objections against Apple\u2019s tap-to-pay practices in 2022, having opened a formal antitrust investigation into Apple Pay two years earlier. The regulators found that Apple had abused its dominant market position by restricting access to the NFC technology needed to make payments on mobile devices. That means rivals wanting to create apps or wallets using the tap-to-pay features on iPhones have been unable to do so and users have been forced to use Apple Pay for mobile payments. \u201cFrom now on, Apple can no longer use its control of the iPhone ecosystem to keep (competing) mobile wallets out of the market,\u201d Vestager said. \u201cCompeting wallet developers as well as consumers will benefit from these changes, opening up innovation and choice while keeping payments secure.\u201d The commitments do not extend to Apple Watches, however. \u201cOur impression was that the number of people who use Apple Watches for payments is rather small,\u201d said Vestager, adding that there was \u201climited harm done\u201d from excluding those devices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/tech/apple-pay-europe-mobile-wallets/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

Not a subscriber? You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. A vast swath of the US economy is showing signs of weakness as unemployment rises to its highest point in more than two years. Consumer demand seems to have tapered off so far this summer, according to surveys of American businesses that sell any kind of service to make a profit, ranging from restaurants to dental clinics. That weakness is also evident in the latest spending figures \u2014 a far cry from last year\u2019s lucrative summertime spending spree when Americans shelled out for films and high-profile concerts. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s latest monthly survey that gauges economic activity in the services sector showed that so-called new orders and overall economic activity unexpectedly slipped into contraction territory last month. The headline index fell to a reading of 48.8 in June from 53.8 in May as the new orders sub-index saw an even steeper decline, down to 47.3 from 54.1. (A reading above 50 indicates expansion while anything below that threshold points to a contraction.) This apparent slowdown in demand, if it persists for long enough, could translate into service-providing businesses hiring at a slower pace and possibly slashing jobs. The overwhelming majority of employment in the United States is considered service-providing, specifically 86% of the 158.6 million total US jobs as of June. \u201cWhen you think of services, a lot of it is driven by the consumer, and consumers are key to where the US economy goes,\u201d James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see stress in more and more households.\u201d The US consumer is indeed under pressure, grappling with still-high inflation, the highest interest rates in more than two decades, depleted pandemic savings (according to some measures), and a growing load of debt. Consumer spending, which makes up about 70% of the US economy, has already moderated over the past few months, government statistics show, and retailers themselves have said they\u2019ve noticed shoppers across the income spectrum change their purchasing behavior. A food services business surveyed by ISM said \u201csales and traffic remain soft compared to last year,\u201d blaming \u201chigh gas prices in California and constant news about inflation and restaurant menu prices.\u201d Spending at restaurants and bars declined 0.4% in May,\u00a0according to the latest Commerce Department figures on retail sales. A retail company told ISM: \u201cWith inflation continuing, will customers have enough discretionary funds to spend?\u201d Knightley provided CNN an analysis of government data showing that Americans in the top 20% of earners were responsible for a large share of spending on services related to transportation (air travel and cruises), recreation, food and finance. The bottom 60% of households by income accounted for a larger proportion of spending on health care services. But it takes time before slowing demand translates into slower hiring or layoffs because businesses have to determine if they didn\u2019t just deal with a bad month or two, perhaps even a bad quarter,\u00a0Scott Hamilton, global chairman of human resource and compensation consulting at Gallagher, told CNN. Service-providing businesses have already been hiring at a weaker clip. These firms have added 168,000 jobs a month, on average, from April through June, according to\u00a0fresh Labor Department data\u00a0released Friday. That\u2019s much lower than the average for the prior three months, from January through March, which was 241,000 jobs. Last year, the average monthly job gain in the services industry was 228,000 jobs. Hiring trends, of course, vary within the services sector, a huge slice of the job market. Last month, retail trade employment shrunk for the first time since November while temporary help services contracted by 48,900 jobs, dragging down the broader professional and business services super sector, which lost 17,000 workers. Health care has been one major bright spot for the services sector, adding jobs at a brisk pace for the past few decades, excluding a drop off in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but even then, some businesses in that industry have recently noticed softening demand. \u201cDemand for services has moderated after near-record patient levels in the last month,\u201d a health care and social assistance firm said in the latest ISM survey. The job market staged a stunning comeback when the broader US economy recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic, eventually leading to unemployment falling to a half-century low of 3.4% in 2023 for the first time. It\u2019s loosened up recently, however, with unemployment now at 4.1%, the highest level since November 2021, and new applications for jobless benefits on an upward trend. Fed officials are keeping a close eye for any alarming signs of weakness in the job market as they await for further evidence that inflation will continue to slow without an unexpectedly hot economy sabotaging that. Tesla is now an official Chinese government car For the first time ever, Tesla cars have been placed on a Chinese government purchase list, according to state-owned media outlet\u00a0Paper.cn. Tesla is the only foreign-owned EV car brand on the purchase catalog published by the government of Jiangsu province in eastern China. The other brands mentioned include Volvo, owned by China\u2019s Geely, and state-owned SAIC, reports my colleague Laura He.That means that government agencies and public groups in the province can procure them as service cars, highlighting the\u00a0cozy relationship\u00a0China has with Elon Musk\u2019s company. The development has gone viral on Chinese social media, with some users questioning if foreign cars should be considered for use by the government. The Jiangsu government has tried to ease such concerns by saying that the Tesla model is \u201ca domestic car, not imported,\u201d according to\u00a0a report\u00a0by state-owned National Business Daily on Thursday, citing a government employee. Tesla, which has a massive gigafactory in Shanghai, manufactured some 947,000 cars in China in 2023, and most of them were used locally. Read more here.

{"id": "2024_07_02_media_biden-mental-fitness", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s White House repeatedly and aggressively shot down reports\u00a0on\u00a0the president\u2019s age and any possible limitations\u00a0on his ability to perform all the duties of his office. But after his shaky debate performance last week, in which Biden routinely struggled to\u00a0get his point across, some in the White House press corps say they wish they had pushed harder to tell the story. In June, when the Wall Street Journal published a\u00a0lengthy piece\u00a0on President Joe Biden\u2019s mental\u00a0state, the newspaper\u00a0got\u00a0slammed.\u00a0The White House, its allies, and\u00a0some in the media\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources\u00a0\u2013\u00a0criticized the Journal for quoting mostly Republican political foes on the record, who had a clear political motive to damage Biden\u2019s image. No Democrats were quoted on the record making those allegations, and several Democrats complained their on-the-record quotes praising Biden\u2019s sharpness were not included. The\u00a0Journal defended its reporting at the time. Last week\u2019s debate on CNN laid bare many of the concerns the Journal\u2019s reporting had raised \u2013 that the president has good days and bad days but can sometimes seem to slip up. A New York Times report on Tuesday raised similar concerns by those who have recently been in the room with Biden. The Times reported Biden has more frequent \u201clapses,\u201d although at other times he appears sharp. After Biden\u2019s lackluster performance last week, some are questioning whether the White House press corps dropped the ball on fully covering Biden\u2019s limitations. Biden\u2019s\u00a0age issue is not secret or new. Nearly every media outlet has reported on\u00a0growing concerns about\u00a0Biden\u2019s age well before the debate. The White House in the past has complained that the coverage is disproportionate, and that the media is spending more time covering Biden\u2019s age than his accomplishments as president versus former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies. The media has faced accusations that it has not covered Biden\u2019s mental fitness more aggressively because it wants to prop up the campaign in some way \u2013 an accusation the White House reporters CNN spoke to denied. Several White House reporters\u00a0told CNN that\u00a0the\u00a0coverage\u00a0of Biden\u2019s age and his mental stamina\u00a0should have\u00a0pushed harder. They cited several difficulties in doing so before the debate \u2013 from the obvious political motivations of sources who either want to protect Biden\u2019s image or project a certain image, to the blowback from pursuing such reports, especially from the White House and Democrats. A difficult task Like all past presidents, Biden has good days and bad days. It\u00a0can be tricky to report on something as difficult to define as a person aging, when his opponent\u00a0is a convicted felon, who regularly lies and has threatened to use the government to go after his political opponents. Still, some reporters said the press corps\u00a0could\u00a0have done a better job\u00a0covering\u00a0Biden\u2019s physical and mental state. The failure of the media, one White House reporter said,\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0pushing more aggressively\u00a0into Biden\u2019s abilities after the release of the Robert Hurr report in February, which called Biden a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d Biden\u2019s age was also a right-wing talking point for years, something the White House was quick to point out to reporters,\u00a0which\u00a0may have inadvertently turned off any serious investigation. For example, deceptively edited clips of Biden from the G7 spread widely by right-wing media figures were made to seem as though he was aimlessly \u201cwandering off\u201d from fellow world leaders when really, he was speaking to parachutists who had just landed during a demonstration. \u201cThe right-wing media was calling him senile from day one, and that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cThen whenever you report on the age you were in some ways solidifying, giving credence to some people that were actually of bad faith.\u201d All the White House reporters who spoke to CNN for this piece chose to speak anonymously so they could speak more freely about their relationship with the White House. Keeping the president at a distance Reporters said the White House has not made the press corps\u2019 job easy:\u00a0The White House has put up guardrails around Biden, they say, and\u00a0he does not engage in as many interviews or planned press conferences\u00a0as previous presidents. At those events,\u00a0the press might be able to gauge how he\u2019s doing on the spot, without prepared remarks. \u201cThey keep him at arm\u2019s length, and he rarely does extended interviews,\u201d the reporter said of the White House,\u00a0although he acknowledged Biden has started giving more interviews as of late. Biden has done fewer interviews and formal press conferences than his most recent predecessors, according to data compiled by\u00a0Martha Joynt Kumar,\u00a0professor emerita of political science at Towson University who chronicles the presidents\u2019 interactions with the press. But on quick and informal interactions with the press, like shouted questions on the way to his helicopter or plane, Biden\u00a0as of this week has had 588 interactions, Kumar reports, second only to Trump when compared to recent presidents. But those interactions are not the same as an extended press conference, reporters noted. On Tuesday, ABC News announced Biden would sit down with George Stephanopoulos for an interview, his first since the debate. The White House press shop has also been very \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cfairly successful\u201d in mitigating coverage of concerns over the president\u2019s age,\u00a0said\u00a0another White House reporter who works for a different publication. \u201c[B]erating reporters who bring them reporting about age concerns, bemoaning that it\u2019s all anyone writes about (clearly, it\u2019s not) and often attacking pieces after they run,\u201d the reporter told CNN. \u201cI think that\u2019s left some folks to conclude that these stories are too painful to report or that they should pick their spots more. It\u2019s clear the age stories that have angered the White House (and the liberal Twittersphere) the most.\u201d Alex Thompson, a White House reporter for Axios, said on CNN the day after the debate that \u201cthe White House\u2019s response every single time\u00a0it\u00a0has come up for three-and-a-half years has been to deflect, to gaslight, to not tell the truth \u2013 not just to reporters, not just to other Democrats, but even at times to themselves about the president\u2019s limitations at his age.\u201d Still, this White House\u2019s recent conduct with reporters pales in comparison to Trump\u2019s team, which has done everything from revoking press access to reporters they disagree with, to calling reporters the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d The White House declined to comment. Aging doesn\u2019t happen all at once Aging is also not a sudden moment.\u00a0That makes it trickier to report on. \u201cTo some extent, the decline has appeared to be gradual \u2014 hard to notice from day to day \u2014 and that\u2019s perhaps made it harder for reporters to determine when is the right moment to write something,\u201d one of the reporters said. Just a few days before the debate, Biden held a press conference at the G7 alongside Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelensky that passed off without anything of note in Biden\u2019s demeanor. But reporters pointed out (and have published stories noting) that the president has been using teleprompters at most big events, even fundraisers where in the past he might not have. He has also started to use the lower stairs to board Air Force One. Last year, The New York Times published a lengthy piece on the \u201ccomplicated reality of America\u2019s oldest president,\u201d which looked at some of those accommodations and concerns for his age, but also the moments where he showed stamina and vigor. Some reporters said that there has been a distinct change\u00a0within the last year, and that the press corps should have reported more aggressively on the accommodations made for the president. \u201cI think the press, most of the White House press, did suffer from a bit of lack of curiosity,\u201d one of the reporters said. Look who you\u2019re up against Biden\u2019s allies will often question coverage of the president\u2019s age, questioning why reporters focus on the president\u2019s age and mental lucidity and not on Trump\u2019s\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who, at 78,\u00a0was observed falling asleep during his hush money trial, has made his own major verbal flubs and bizarre statements, and regularly spouts complete falsehoods. \u201cIt makes sense to reflect on this now and ask whether we missed or, really, under-reported the story of Biden\u2019s age and decline. But it\u2019s complicated,\u201d one of the reporters said. \u201cThe fact that the political alternative to Biden is an authoritarian who sparked an insurrection and is a convicted felon does not mean that the press is failing American democracy to focus on Biden\u2019s obvious frailty.\u201d One of the reporters said the media can, and do, report on both. Biden\u2019s allies, however, say too much attention is placed on Biden\u2019s age and not on the threat Trump could pose to American democracy. But the reporters say they can, and should, do both. \u201cJust because you are reporting on Biden age, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not reporting on Trump\u2019s lies.\u00a0 I find that argument silly, and it seems one design towards like producing a certain outcome in the election, rather than like an honest reporting,\u201d one of the reporters said. The outlets that had received harsh blowback for their previous reports on Biden\u2019s lucidity now feel justified. A source familiar with the staff behind the Wall Street Journal\u2019s report said that when the piece first published, the reporters were approached by people with sympathy asking how they\u2019re doing \u201cas if something terrible had just happened,\u201d the source said. After the debate, the reporters started to get messages saying they were right.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/media/biden-mental-fitness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

The funding comes as growth in new electric vehicle sales has slowed, even as the Biden administration wants to keep US EV manufacturers competitive with a surging Chinese industry. Just earlier this year President Joe Biden quadrupled tariffs on electric vehicles from China. \u201cThis announcement is a hallmark of the Biden administration\u2019s industrial strategy, which is a strategy to bring manufacturing jobs back to America after years of offshoring,\u201d Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told reporters. The plants selected by the Department of Energy for the money, which comes from the landmark Inflation Reduction Act, cover eight states, including critical battlegrounds like Michigan and Pennsylvania. \u201cBuilding a clean energy economy can and should be a win-win for union autoworkers and automakers. This investment will create thousands of good-paying, union manufacturing jobs and retain even more\u2014from Lansing, Michigan to Fort Valley, Georgia \u2013 by helping auto companies retool, reboot, and rehire in the same factories and communities,\u201d President Joe Biden said in a statement. The projects, according to the administration, create an estimated 2,900 new jobs and save 15,000 jobs that would otherwise have been lost. The awardees include major automakers like GM and Volvo as well as suppliers, like American Auto Parts. The plants also include facilities from vehicle component manufacturing to full vehicle assembly, according to a senior administration official. The move comes as the growth rate of EV sales has slowed even as total EV sales have continued to rise. The industry,\u00a0according to experts, has entered a phase where automakers are struggling to bridge the gap from early adopters to mass market consumers. This has led to some automakers taking an increased interest in the hybrid space, with sales up across the country and GM and Ford both announcing that they plan to make more. And notably, the facilities in Thursday\u2019s announcement work on both electric and hybrid vehicles.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/business/biden-administration-ev-electric-vehicles-manufacturing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. The United States\u2019 biggest banks are in the hot seat this week. JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo kick off bank earnings on Friday morning. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America report quarterly results next week. The financials sector is expected to see annual earnings growth of 4.3% during the second quarter, according to FactSet. Investors will watch bank earnings closely for clues about how the American consumer and economy are faring in the face of sky-high interest rates and cooling, yet still elevated, inflation. Dave Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar, says that he\u2019s watching for insights on banks\u2019 delinquency rates. Consumers have increasingly fallen behind on or missed payments in recent months as they get squeezed by high interest rates. The share of credit card balances in serious delinquency, defined as payments 90 days or more late, rose to its highest percentage since 2012 during the first quarter, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Corporate earnings and economic data in recent months have signaled that consumers are more judicious about their spending. US retail sales edged higher at an unexpectedly weak pace in May. Target, Home Depot and Best Buy have reported that shoppers are spending less on discretionary items, while discount retailers are benefitting as Americans hunt for deals. The US financial system appears to be in a solid place after last year\u2019s regional banking crisis. All 31 banks evaluated in the Fed\u2019s annual stress test, which assesses the financial resilience of banks under hypothetical fraught conditions, passed this year. But banks could see higher losses compared to 2023 if the economy were to experience a downturn, the Fed warned. Recession isn\u2019t the market consensus. Stocks have surged to repeated record highs in recent weeks as strong corporate earnings expectations, cooling inflation and a resilient labor market build the case for a soft landing, or a scenario in which the Fed brings inflation down without triggering an economic slump. Investors are wagering that the central bank will begin easing rates as soon as September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean banks aren\u2019t preparing for a less ideal scenario. Wall Street will keep an eye on their loan reserve levels. Those reserves contain cash that banks stockpile to protect themselves against potential defaulted loans. Commercial banks and savings institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had roughly $218.6 billion reserved for loan losses during the first quarter of this year, according to FDIC data. That\u2019s up from the $202.1 billion financial institutions set aside during the same period in 2023 and $175.5 billion the year before that. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said at the company\u2019s global China summit in May that while consumers are still resilient, he believes a recession isn\u2019t off the table. \u201cThe worst outcome for all of us is what you call stagflation: higher rates and recession,\u201d Dimon said in an interview with CNBC. \u201cThe world will survive that, but I just think the odds are a little bit higher than other people think.\u201d The US economy faces a new threat The biggest danger facing the American economy for years has been inflation, reports my colleague Matt Egan. Now, another problem is emerging as a credible threat on the horizon: Unemployment. Just as inflation continues to cool, yellow lights are flashing in the still-strong jobs market. The Federal Reserve must now confront the risk that it\u2019s making a mistake by keeping interest rates too high for too long. That\u2019s why some economists are pleading with the Fed to ease up its inflation fight\u2014before high interest rates, which it\u2019s used to tame surging prices, grind the US economy into a recession. \u201cIt\u2019s time to cut rates,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. \u201cInflation is fading as the primary focus of concern. The balance of risks is slowly tipping towards higher unemployment.\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said the labor market is straining under the weight of high borrowing costs. \u201cThe biggest danger is a policy mistake: The Fed keeps rates too high for too long,\u201d Zandi told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cRight now, the Fed is signaling a September cut. I think that\u2019s okay, but if they wait any longer than that, I fear they are going to overdo it.\u201d Even Fed Chair Jerome Powell is acknowledging a significant shift in the risk calculus.

{"id": "2024_06_01_success_buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage", "text": "Moving somewhere new when you retire isn\u2019t uncommon. But deciding whether to take out a new mortgage to buy a home is a big deal. Much of your financial life is changing as you transition from a steady paycheck to a mix of fixed and variable income and a new lifestyle. So adding a large debt to the picture isn\u2019t an easy call. That\u2019s especially true now that mortgage rates hover around 7% and home prices keep rising. \u201cAny time you take on debt, you increase risk in your situation,\u201d said Illinois-based certified financial planner Jim Stork. More than a third (35%) of homebuyers last year were between the ages of 59 and 98, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Within that group, a majority financed their purchases. Whether taking out a new mortgage makes sense for you depends on a lot of factors, including how to prove to a lender that you\u2019re a good credit risk, plus your feelings about the debt and the ongoing cost of maintaining a home. To get a mortgage, your age won\u2019t be a factor, but your income will be If you\u2019re concerned that you may be less attractive to a mortgage banker because you\u2019ve hit retirement age, know that it is illegal to discriminate against anyone applying for a mortgage based on their age. Lenders\u2019 chief focus will be on your ability to repay your mortgage with your various sources of non-paycheck income. \u201cWhen you qualify for a mortgage, it\u2019s all based on your income,\u201d said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage. That, and of course any debt you have that will soak up your income, but we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. The income sources that lenders consider, absent a regular paycheck, include: Social Security benefits, pension or annuity income, spousal benefits, disability payments, interest and dividends and your 401(k) or IRA. If a portion of your income is not subject to tax, the lender may treat it as worth 25% more. Fannie Mae offers this example: Say 15% of a $1,500 monthly Social Security benefit is tax free. That means $225 of it will not be subject to tax ($1,500 x 15%). And 25% of that amount comes to $56 ($225 x 25%). So that $56 can be added to a person\u2019s qualifying Social Security income amount ($1,500 + $56 = $1,556). If you want to use your nest egg, different methods can be used to calculate how much income it would provide. There is the asset depletion method in which your eligible assets are divided by your loan term. In the case of a 30-year mortgage, that would be 360 months. If your IRA is worth $700,000, that translates into $1,944 per month ($700,000/360). \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to take the money out \u2014 but you can use your assets [to qualify for a mortgage] as if you were going to take the distribution,\u201d Cohn said. Another option: If you are at least 59-1/2, you can start taking monthly distributions from an IRA without penalty \u2014 or a 401(k) if your plan rules permit \u2014 and the lender will count that as income so long as you show that you have sufficient funds in the account to keep taking that same monthly distribution for three years. Once you close on your home, Cohn said, you can reduce or stop taking distributions if you choose. That assumes you are not yet in your 70s when the IRS requires you to start taking minimum distributions, said Mark Luscombe, a principal analyst at Wolters, Kluwer Tax & Accounting. Burdened by debt? Lenders will also assess your debt-to-income ratio, because no matter how much income you have, the big question is how much of it will be consumed by your debts. The debt portion is composed of your expected mortgage payment plus any credit card, student loan, car loan or other outstanding debt you may have. Generally speaking, for conventional loans your DTI ratio can be up to 50%, Cohen said. That ratio falls to between 43% and 45% if you\u2019re taking out a jumbo loan, she added. A jumbo loan exceeds the conforming loan limits in the area you want to buy. But ideally your debt level will fall well below these top limits, both for the lender\u2019s sake and yours. And, of course, the higher your credit score, the better the interest rate you can get on a mortgage. What you should consider before taking out a mortgage Even before seeking a mortgage, get a good grasp on your expected monthly income and expenses in retirement. Compared to pre-retirement earnings, \u201cMost (new retirees) see a decrease in income,\u201d said certified financial planner Lori Trawinski, director of finance and employment at AARP. While some expenses may also decline \u2014 e.g., work-related costs like commuting \u2014 others may increase over time, Trawinski said, like medical costs, property taxes, home insurance and utilities. Of course, you can downsize and move to a lower-cost area. But if you stay near where you lived during your career, your expenses are likely to rise over time. Also, Trawinski noted, if you\u2019re married, consider what will happen to your household income when one spouse dies. This will help you assess your future comfort level in carrying a mortgage. \u201cPeople often fail to plan for the death of a spouse. You can take a big hit to your income when that happens,\u201d she said. If you do move to a new state or region, weigh renting first. You can get a better sense of the cost of living in the area and decide whether it\u2019s a good fit for you. As Stork put it, \u201cFlorida in August is not as fun as Florida in January.\u201d How much are you really willing to take on? All the usual financial decisions that go into homebuying apply no matter your age. But, in retirement especially, you don\u2019t want to take on more debt than necessary, since the cost of a mortgage is fixed, but the returns on your investments, the housing market and your health needs are variable. At the very least, Stork said, consider whether you can put enough money down \u2014 at least 20% \u2014 to avoid having to pay private mortgage insurance. Beyond that, consider whether you feel comfortable keeping up \u2014 and paying for \u2014 maintenance on a home. Maintenance might amount to 2% a year of your home\u2019s value, Stork said. That amounts to $10,000 a year on a $500,000 home. Maintenance is essential in preserving the value of your house should you ever decide to sell. How would your mortgage interest rate compare to a reasonable rate of return on your investments? The decision to get a mortgage was a lot easier for retirees when rates were historically low \u2014 roughly 3% \u2014 and their nest eggs were earning a lot more. \u201cBut at today\u2019s rates it\u2019s a much harder calculation,\u201d Stork said. This is especially the case if you\u2019re a very conservative investor. \u201cIf your CDs are earning 4% and a mortgage would cost you 7%, you will lose money every day on that decision,\u201d Stork explained. To get the truest reading on what makes financial sense, compare mortgage expenses to your investment returns on an after-tax basis, Stork noted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/success/buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

The use of an AI voice for the Olympics comes as the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, sound and text.

The company said the highlights could be packaged in about 7 million different ways, pulled from 5,000 hours of live coverage in Paris, effectively making AI (the artificial intelligence, not the man) a significantly more efficient way to deliver personalized recaps.  \u201cWhen I was approached about this, I was skeptical but obviously curious,\u201d Michaels said in a press release. \u201cThen I saw a demonstration detailing what they had in mind.

He\u2019s also known for his work on previous Olympics Games broadcasts for both NBC and ABC and for calling the Miracle on Ice Game at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. NBC said the AI system was trained using prior NBC broadcast audio from Michaels. The company said a team of NBC Sports editors will review all of the content, including audio and clips, to make sure everything is factually accurate and names are pronounced correctly.

The settlement brings to an end a lawsuit filed in November 2023 from three Jewish students over NYU\u2019s alleged failure to enforce its anti-discrimination policies, claiming their civil rights were violated over the university\u2019s handling of\u00a0discrimination and harassment\u00a0against Jewish students. \u201cWe are committed to continuing our vigorous efforts to confront discrimination, including antisemitism, and the settlement in this litigation is yet another step in this direction,\u201d NYU President Linda Mills said in a joint statement with the plaintiffs. The university said it \u201ctakes seriously all allegations of discrimination, confirms that NYU treats all allegations of discrimination against Jews and Israelis in the same manner that it treats conduct prohibited under Title VI and other civil rights statutes when directed at other protected groups.\u201d In the lawsuit, Bella Ingber, Sabrina Maslavi and Saul Tawil, each a junior attending NYU, alleged that NYU created a hostile educational environment that subjected them and other Jewish students to \u201cpervasive acts of hatred, discrimination, harassment, and intimidation\u201d in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The settlement also creates a new \u201cTitle VI Coordinator\u201d position that ensures the university \u201cresponds adequately and consistently to allegations of discrimination and harassment based on all protected traits.\u201d They will also be tasked in creating an annual report about disciplinary data and another report that examines NYU\u2019s disciplinary responses to \u201callegations of discrimination or harassment\u201d since 2018. The suit claimed there had been a \u201csteadily increasing incidence of antisemitic attacks at NYU\u201d over the past 10 years and said the university has failed to enforce its own policies to protect Jewish students. The campus was a flashpoint in protests following the October 7 attacks by Hamas in Israel and Israel\u2019s response in Gaza. \u201cNYU, by entering into this historic settlement, is to be commended for taking a leading position among American universities in combating antisemitism on campus. Other universities should promptly follow their lead,\u201d said Marc Kasowitz, an attorney for the plaintiffs, in the joint statement.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/business/nyu-lawsuit-antisemitism/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_business_uaw-biden-fain", "text": "United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain and other members of the union\u2019s board have expressed concerns about President Joe Biden\u2019s ability to beat Donald Trump in November, a source close to the union says. The union is discussing the way forward on how to beat Trump in November, but the group is not considering rescinding its endorsement of Biden at this time, the source added. The doubts come as Biden is facing growing worries about his ability to beat his predecessor in the presidential election, after a disastrous performance at last month\u2019s CNN presidential debate raised fresh questions about his age and his mental acuity. Reuters was first to report Fain\u2019s concerns. When a reporter at a Thursday press conference raised the UAW\u2019s concerns, the president responded, \u201cThe UAW just endorsed me.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go this campaign,\u201d the president later added. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna keep moving.\u201d Biden now is working to shore up support within the labor community.\u00a0The president spent about 30 minutes at the AFL-CIO headquarters in Washington, DC, on Wednesday, describing the group of union leaders as his \u201cdomestic NATO.\u201d After Biden\u2019s drop-by, the group met privately for some time, including hearing from campaign officials. Fain, a vocal Trump critic, is a member of the AFL-CIO\u2019s executive council, which on Wednesday announced it \u201cunanimously\u00a0voted\u00a0to reaffirm its commitment to re-electing President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the leadership of the most pro-union administration in our lifetimes.\u201d The UAW formally endorsed Biden in January after months of White House overtures to the union chief. The endorsement was seen as a major boon for Biden as he looked to court working class voters in swing states like Michigan and Wisconsin. The president is set to visit Michigan on Friday as he pushes forward with his campaign in the face of deep reservations within his party over his ability to win in November. A union spokesperson declined to comment on the Reuters report. A growing list of prominent Democrats, including sitting senators and members of Congress as well as actor and fundraiser George Clooney, have called for Biden to step aside for a new party nominee for November. In a statement Wednesday, the day Biden visited the group, the AFL-CIO executive council said in a statement: \u201cThe labor movement understands, as Joe Biden does, that solidarity is how we win. The message from today\u2019s meeting couldn\u2019t have been clearer: Right now, it\u2019s time to come together around a vision of a country where everyone has a fair shot with a living wage, affordable health care, retirement security, and time to do the things we love like spending time with family and friends and pursuing our interests and passions.\u201d AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler sought to show a united front after the president\u2019s drop-by, posting a photo on X and writing \u201cHe believes in unions \u2013 and we believe in him.\u201d Biden arrived at the AFL-CIO headquarters shortly after actor George Clooney called for the president to step aside in the 2024 race in a New York Times op-ed. While meeting with the new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in the Oval Office hours later, the president was peppered with questions from reporters about Clooney\u2019s statement, to which he raised his arms and replied \u201cAFL-CIO! Go, go go!\u201d The president has won the backing of most of the country\u2019s largest union groups at a time when Trump has also sought to make inroads with rank-and-file members. \u201cI said I was going to be the most pro union president in American history, well guess what I am,\u201d Biden said Wednesday. \u201cAnd I\u2019m staying there.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/business/uaw-biden-fain/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_04_24_tech_nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc", "text": "Texting on the Moon? Streaming on Mars? It may not be as far away as you think. That\u2019s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets. A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year \u2014 the exact date has yet to be confirmed \u2014 carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon\u2019s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth. \u201cThe first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,\u201d Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation. The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia\u2019s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice. One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice. Images of ice \u2014 transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network \u2014 would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon. For NASA\u2019s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable. Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund \u2014 especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated. \u201cBeing able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis \u2014 as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,\u201d said Engelund. \u201cEventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.\u201d It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth\u2019s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing \ufeffspace colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth. NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy. Bell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the \u201cframework for the lunar economy.\u201d \u201cA future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,\u201d Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN. \u201cThis includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.\u201d There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too. If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth \u2014 such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms. \u201cEspecially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,\u201d Klein said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/tech/nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_media_white-house-press-corps-biden", "text": "For weeks,\u00a0the White House press corps has been boiling \u2013 and not from the Washington, DC, heat. They\u2019re frustrated. Some feel the White House misled the press before President Joe Biden\u2019s stumbling performance at last month\u2019s CNN presidential debate. Others have been exasperated by the White House\u2019s response since then to questions about the president\u2019s health, often leading to follow-ups and clarifications from the administration on otherwise straightforward questions. And nearly all of the White House correspondents who spoke to CNN for this report felt the president should have held a press conference with reporters in the immediate aftermath of the debate. Now, two weeks after Biden\u2019s eye-opening debate performance, journalists from the nation\u2019s biggest news outlets will finally get their chance to question the president directly when Biden takes questions Thursday evening during the NATO summit. Expect fireworks. Since the debate, the journalists tasked with covering the White House have been imploring the president\u2019s communications team \u2013 who said the debate was just a \u201cbad night\u201d \u2013 to prove it, allowing him to take questions directly from the press. \u201cThis is a period of time here where the public is trying to understand what happened,\u201d NBC\u2019s Kelly O\u2019Donnell said on July 2. \u201cAnd the president could help to answer that by engaging with us in an unscripted way right now.\u201d In the weeks since the debate, a media frenzy has erupted around Biden, with the White House and Biden campaign\u00a0coming under intense scrutiny for any sign that aides are attempting to shield the president or potentially cover up any of his missteps that might show a decline. The\u00a0discontent has been on full display in the White House briefing room, where reporters have openly sparred with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, particularly over the president\u2019s medical history. Amid pushback from the press, the White House has been forced to revisit answers to some questions. CBS News senior White House correspondent\u00a0Ed O\u2019Keefe laid it all out during a dust-up with Jean-Pierre on Monday. \u201cWell, we\u2019re a little miffed around here about how information has been shared with the press corps,\u201d he\u00a0said.\u00a0\u201cYou answer it incorrectly and then have to come back and clean it up a few days later.\u201d \u201cNo, wait a minute,\u201d Jean-Pierre replied. \u201cCalm \u2014 Ed, please.\u00a0A little respect here, please.\u201d Jean-Pierre said she and the White House communications staff have been doing \u201cour best in this briefing to provide the information that we have.\u201d \u201cI will be the first one to admit: Sometimes I get it wrong. At least I admit that,\u201d she added. But the exchange was symbolic of the growing distrust between the White House communications team and the press corps, which has bristled over\u00a0what they perceive to be\u00a0a lack of transparency and access to Biden, who has conducted fewer press conferences than his recent predecessors. The following day, Jean-Pierre was asked about a neurologist\u2019s visit to the White House earlier this year, which she denied had been related to the president. But later that evening, Jean-Pierre\u00a0issued a statement\u00a0correcting her comments. \u201cThis is the second time in less than a week where the briefing had prompted a need for later clarification on questions about the president\u2019s health,\u201d Associated Press White House reporter Seung Min Kim said in the briefing room Tuesday. It turned out the neurologists\u2019 visits were not all related to the president, after a breathless news cycle that, at times, implied the president was being treated for Parkinson\u2019s (the White House says he is not).\u00a0But while the tense moments in the briefing room may seem to focus on small details and semantics, for the press it\u2019s about credibility. \u201cI think this is a credibility crisis writ large for the White House, and certainly as a spokesperson for the White House, this is a credibility crisis for her,\u201d one White House reporter told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the situation. \u201cIf they were answering truthfully, with a sense of fidelity to the question in a well-meaning way, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily see (those blow-ups in the briefing room),\u201d the reporter added. The reporter said the press corps has not suddenly decided \u201cto get tough\u201d on the White House in wake of the debate, noting that reporters have been frustrated with how Jean-Pierre has answered from the podium for more than a year and a half. \u201cWe saw the debate. We asked questions. The answers that we got in response to those questions were unsatisfactory,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re reporters, looking, probing when given unsatisfactory answers.\u201d In a statement to CNN, White House spokesman Andrew Bates defended Jean-Pierre, saying she \u201ctakes hard questions every day, providing thorough answers\u201d and represents President Biden \u201cwith grace and integrity.\u201d \u201cAnd she does that with respect, knowing it\u2019s the obligation of journalists to constantly ask for more information; and that if any White House press corps, in any administration, were ever satisfied they would not be doing their jobs,\u201d Bates said. \u201cWhatever disagreements she may have with reporters, she never gives anonymous quotes criticizing any of them. Instead, she keeps her office door open.\u201d Even before the debate, Biden has held fewer press conferences than his most recent predecessors. Biden has held 36 press conferences thus far in his presidency, fewer than former presidents Donald Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush at the same point in their presidencies. While the White House has countered that\u00a0Biden has held\u00a0more\u00a0off-the-cuff interactions with the press than his predecessors while traveling to events and meetings, reporters say those are nowhere near the same as an open format press conference. Bates said Biden has \u201cproudly fought for the rights of journalists in the world and spoken forcefully about the \u2018critical\u2019 role of the press in American democracy \u2013 rather than slander them as \u2018enemies of the people.\u2019 In line with those values, his team reinstated daily press briefings and works hard to be informative and factual, including by releasing more documentation on policy than at any time in American history.\u201d But a former White House staffer under President Bill Clinton told CNN that Biden\u2019s team had deployed an astute strategy to not put the president in front of the media\u00a0as often because they have to \u201cplay to his strengths, which is not a news conference.\u201d \u201cThe media\u2019s game is,\u00a0\u2018let\u2019s do a press conference, because that\u2019s the only way you can demonstrate to us.\u2019 Well, guess what? They don\u2019t need to demonstrate to the media. They need to demonstrate to the country,\u201d the former staffer said. \u201cAnd if I were advising them, I would say, play to his strengths. And if that means fixed events, that means, you know, less formal interviews, whatever it is, that\u2019s what I tell them to do.\u201d But as questions continue to swirl around Biden\u2019s mental fitness, a mounting challenge for the White House and Biden\u2019s campaign is the growing belief that the White House and campaign have not been transparent about his condition. \u201cWe are in the midst of a full-blown feeding frenzy,\u201d former CNN White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief Frank Sesno said. Sesno and former White House correspondents and officials told CNN that questions surrounding Biden\u2019s age and performance, along with how the White House is handling the issue, are legitimate and warrant scrutiny. But they cautioned that the emphasis of the reporting needs to be on how Biden has fundamentally changed over time. \u201cIf a subtext takes hold in the press corps, it\u2019s very, very difficult for a president to break out of that, and Biden is dealing with that today \u2014 that he\u2019s too old,\u201d said Kenneth Walsh, the author of \u201cThe Architects of Toxic Politics in America\u201d and a former White House correspondent for U.S. News & World Report. \u201cThat\u2019s the story that we\u2019re all focused on now, because we see evidence of it, and so it\u2019s a rather easy story to do, and it\u2019s a dramatic story, and it\u2019s valuable to keep people focused on it because we think it\u2019s important to understanding this president.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/media/white-house-press-corps-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_media_paramount-global-skydance-merger-announcement", "text": "Paramount Global\u2014the sprawling media empire behind CBS,\u00a0MTV, and one of Hollywood\u2019s most storied movie studios\u2014has agreed to merge with technology scion David Ellison\u2019s Skydance Media,\u00a0ending years of speculation over the company\u2019s fate. The deal\u00a0announced late Sunday\u00a0comes just weeks after a previous offer from Ellison to acquire Paramount collapsed in the eleventh\u00a0hour, stunning industry observers and raising questions about the beleaguered media company\u2019s future. The agreement\u00a0cements Ellison as a media mogul, ending Shari Redstone\u2019s control of Paramount through her family\u2019s National Amusements holding company, after her father, the late Sumner Redstone, won a fierce bidding war to piece together the media conglomerate beginning in the 1980s. The complicated transaction will see Skydance first buy National Amusements, then merge with Paramount, valuing Skydance at $4.75 billion. Ellison\u2019s production company\u00a0will \u201cinvest $2.4 billion to acquire National Amusements for cash and $4.5 billion for the stock/cash merger consideration to be paid for publicly traded Class A shares and Class B shares, as well as $1.5 billion of primary capital to be added to Paramount\u2019s balance sheet,\u201d it said. The combined company will be helmed by Ellison as chief executive and former NBCUniversal chief Jeff Shell as president. In a call with investors Monday morning, Ellison and Shell laid out their strategy for Paramount, aiming to become a \u201ctechnological leader\u201d in the streaming space, and announcing reorganization plans that will include $2 billion in cost cuts.\u201cWe love the creative engine of this company, but obviously a big chunk of the company is in the linear world \u2014 and we know that linear is challenged and declining,\u201d Shell said. \u201cI think a lot of us in the business know we\u2019ve got to run these businesses in a different way as they decline.\u201d The deal caps a tumultuous and protracted saga that began in December, with the two companies entering into exclusive negotiations in April, resulting in\u00a0the ouster\u00a0of longtime Paramount chief executive Bob Bakish. In the meantime, the company has been run by a triumvirate of leaders: Brian Robbins, chief executive of Paramount Pictures; Chris McCarthy, chief executive of Showtime and MTV Entertainment Studios; and George Cheeks, chief executive of CBS. While legacy media companies have struggled in recent years, Paramount, with its extensive portfolio of cable channels including MTV and Comedy Central, has been heavily exposed to the earthshaking consumer shift away from the traditional television model to streaming services. As services like Netflix exploded in popularity, millions of people abandoned cable packages in favor of lower-priced on-demand streaming shows and movies. Paramount, with its heavy reliance on the television business, was caught flat-footed. In an attempt to stave off declining cable revenues, Paramount spent billions building its own streaming service, Paramount+. But\u00a0it was late to the game, and\u00a0like the rival streaming platforms erected by other legacy media companies, the service has struggled to gain enough traction with consumers to supplement its losses in the linear television business. The iconic company\u2019s valuation has also plunged amid the turmoil, with shares of Paramount falling more than\u00a075% in the last five years.\u00a0At a company town hall last month, Robbins acknowledged it had been a turbulent period as questions swirled over the conglomerate\u2019s future. \u201cWe\u2019d like to take a moment to acknowledge the challenges of all the M&A speculation surrounding our company. We know what a difficult and disruptive period it has been,\u201d Robbins said. \u201cAnd while we cannot say that the noise will disappear, we are here today to lay out a go-forward plan that can set us up for success no matter what path the company chooses to go down.\u201d While Redstone had been approached in recent years to sell off pieces of Paramount\u2019s extensive media portfolio, including Showtime and the cable network BET, several high-priced deals to break up the company were ultimately rejected. In recent months, as takeover offers for Paramount began to once again heat up, Sony Pictures and\u00a0the private equity firm\u00a0Apollo Global Management offered a $26 billion deal that would have made Sony the majority shareholder and Apollo the minority shareholder.\u00a0But the deal would have resulted in the breakup of Paramount, a prospect that Redstone rejected over her strong attachment to the\u00a0company\u00a0that her father had spent decades building. The sale to Skydance Media, founded in 2010 by David Ellison, son of Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, offered Redstone an offer she couldn\u2019t refuse: billions in cash and the comfort of selling the family company to the heir of another titan who has promised to invest into Paramount\u2019s future. Skydance and Paramount also had a deep established relationship, partnering\u00a0in recent years\u00a0to produce some of the box office\u2019s biggest blockbusters, including \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d films. \u201cGiven the changes in the industry, we want to fortify Paramount for the future while ensuring that content remains king,\u201d Redstone said in a statement. \u201cOur hope is that the Skydance transaction will enable Paramount\u2019s continued success in this rapidly changing environment.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/media/paramount-global-skydance-merger-announcement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_investing_france-election-euro-market-reaction", "text": "French stocks and government bonds struggled to find direction Monday following surprise results in France\u2019s parliamentary elections, which saw left-wing parties outperform the far right Sunday, leaving the country\u2019s parliament facing gridlock. The yield, or return sought by investors, on benchmark 10-year bonds ticked down to 3.18% by late afternoon local time, reversing a slight rise recorded earlier in the day. The premium traders demand to hold French bonds instead of the ultra-safe German equivalents was also lower on the day. However, it was still a lot higher than before French President Emmanuel Macron called the snap elections on June 9. French markets have been unsettled ever since Macron\u2019s shock decision, which came after his Renaissance party lost to the far right in a vote for European Union lawmakers earlier in June. The 46-year-old centrist has driven pro-growth economic reforms in Europe\u2019s second-biggest economy, which investors fear could now be rolled back under a very different parliament. French finance minister Bruno Le Maire warned in a post on X Monday that the \u201cmost immediate\u201d risks following Sunday\u2019s results were a financial crisis and a national economic decline. Le Maire pointed to the \u201cexorbitant, ineffective and dated\u201d plans of the New Popular Front, the left-wing alliance of parties that came first after the second-round vote Sunday. Implementing these plans would \u201cdestroy\u201d the achievements of Macron\u2019s centrist government, which have created jobs and new factories over the past seven years, he argued. Analysts\u00a0at Rabobank\u00a0said Monday that uncertainty over the composition of the next government\u00a0was\u00a0likely to keep\u00a0the risk premium on French government bonds \u2014 the so-called spread over German debt \u2014\u00a0at \u201celevated levels\u201d compared with\u00a0before Macron announced the snap elections. The New Popular Front beat Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally in Sunday\u2019s vote, putting it in third place, in a stunning reversal of first-round results. But with the left falling short of the 289 seats needed for a majority and with a weakened president, the national assembly is expected to be more fractured than ever. France is now set for a prolonged period of instability as three opposing blocs with competing ideas and agendas try to form a coalition or find themselves stuck in a state of paralysis. \u201cThe so-called \u2018Republican Front\u2019 whereby parties co-operate to block the far right\u2019s ascendance to power proved remarkably successful but leaves the parliament split,\u201d\u00a0the\u00a0Rabobank analysts wrote in a note Monday. \u201cWe are now likely looking at a period of policy paralysis.\u201d France\u2019s CAC 40 index, which represents 40 of the biggest companies listed in Paris, was up 0.13% by late afternoon local time, reversing a fall notched earlier in the day. The index has dropped 3.9% since Macron called the snap\u00a0elections. The euro was broadly steady against the US dollar by 9.43 a.m. ET, having bobbed up and down slightly earlier in the day. The value of the currency, which is shared by 19 other countries in the EU, has swung wildly since\u00a0June 9. Gridlock on debt? A gridlocked parliament raises the specter of a government unable to pass key reforms, including measures to reduce France\u2019s huge government debt pile, which was equal to 110.6% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product at the end of last year. The budget deficit \u2014 the difference between what the government spends and what it receives in taxes \u2014 reached 5.5%\u00a0of GDP last year. The New Popular Front has made sweeping spending commitments, including a substantial increase to the minimum wage and a freeze on prices for many essential goods. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at bank Berenberg, called the group\u2019s plans \u201cunaffordable\u201d in a note Monday. \u201c(The election result) threatens to exacerbate France\u2019s fiscal problems,\u201d he wrote, adding that France would likely struggle to pass a budget for next year that complied with EU rules. \u201cThe strong showing for the united left as a whole makes it difficult for the moderate left to break ranks with the far left and ditch the most expensive parts\u201d of the New Popular Front\u2019s fiscal plans, Schmieding added.

The European Commission said in a statement Monday that, in its preliminary view, \u201cthis binary choice forces users to consent to the (use) of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalized but equivalent version of Meta\u2019s social networks.\u201d If the provisional findings of the Commission\u2019s investigation are confirmed, the EU could hit Meta with a fine equivalent to 10% of its global annual revenue under its landmark Digital Markets Act. Based on the company\u2019s 2023 results, that would amount to $13.5 billion. Meta said it didn\u2019t accept the Commission\u2019s findings. \u201c\u2019Subscription for no ads\u2019 follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.\u201d The EU announcement comes a week after the Commission accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the DMA by preventing app developers from freely directing consumers to cheaper services. The regulators are also investigating Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) under the new law. The DMA, which came into force in March, requires dominant online platforms \u2014 so-called gatekeepers \u2014 to give users more choice, and rivals more opportunities to compete. Online platforms often collect personal data across their own and third-party services and use it in digital advertising services. Margrethe Vestager, a European Commissioner in charge of competition policy, noted in Monday\u2019s statement that Meta had been accumulating personal data of \u201cmillions of EU citizens over many years.\u201d \u201cWe want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalized ads experience,\u201d she said. Michael Koenig, a senior official at the Commission, said Meta must offer users an alternative to \u201cfull\u201d ad personalization that \u201cdoes not rely on this personal data and which is then automatically less personalized and still available to them.\u201d \u201cThen Meta is free to keep a third option, which is a subscription not to see ads at all, or a fourth option which may have some premium features,\u201d he told journalists. The Commission is due to conclude its probe into Meta by late March next year.

{"id": "2024_06_12_success_saving-under-high-interest-rates", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is an updated version of an article that originally ran on May 1. As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged for its seventh meeting in a row on Wednesday. People carrying variable-rate debt like credit cards and those seeking a loan won\u2019t be happy given that the Fed\u2019s rate, which directly and indirectly affects consumers\u2019 borrowing costs, remains at a 23-year high. Those rates will likely stay high for a while. At this point, only one cut is seen as likely before the end of the year, according to US central bankers\u2019 latest summary of economic projections. But whenever the cuts start, they may be small. \u201cAbsent a complete about-face from the economy, interest rates aren\u2019t likely to come down soon enough, or fast enough, to provide meaningful relief to borrowers. Utilize zero-percent credit card balance transfer offers, shop around for lower fixed-rate personal loans and home equity loans, and channel as much income as possible toward paying down this debt as quickly as possible,\u201d said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com\u2019s chief financial analyst. But the Fed\u2019s decision leaves savers, once again, in the catbird seat when it comes to making money on their money. \u201cSavers are enjoying the best returns on savings accounts and CDs in more than 15 years, with the most competitive offers outpacing inflation. In addition, these conditions are poised to persist for the foreseeable future,\u201d McBride said. Online high-yield savings accounts The best bang for your savings can still be had in online high-yield savings accounts at FDIC-insured banks, which yield way more than today\u2019s 0.58% overall average savings rate. As of June 11, the average online savings account rate was 4.40%, according to DepositAccounts.com. And many online high-yield accounts continue to offer rates of 5% or more. Say you have $10,000 in savings. If you leave it parked in a regular savings account at 0.5%, you\u2019ll get $50 in interest for a year. If you put it instead in a 5% high-yield account, you\u2019ll get $500. A high-yield savings account is the best place to park money you\u2019ll need to cover emergencies as well as anticipated large expenses that you have to pay in the next three months to a year. As with any savings account, banks can lower the rate they offer \u2014 also known as the APY \u2014 at any time. And you can be sure they will do just that when the Fed looks like it will finally start cutting rates, McBride said. But, he added, since rates are likely to be cut in small increments, online high-yield savings accounts may continue to offer inflation-beating returns for some time. \u201cThey will still offer the best way to preserve your [money\u2019s] buying power,\u201d McBride said. Money market accounts and money market funds Money market deposit accounts and money market mutual funds are generating yields competitive with the best high-yield savings accounts. But there are important differences. Money market deposit accounts are bank products. So, assuming your bank is FDIC insured, your account is too. (Or, if your account is at a federally backed credit union, your money will be\u00a0insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.) As with high-yield accounts, you may get the best deals at an online bank. But money market accounts may have a higher minimum deposit requirement than a high-yield account. Money market funds, by contrast, are an investment product \u2014 they generate return by investing in short-term, low-risk debt instruments and are currently yielding an average of 5.12%, according to the Crane 100 Money Fund Index. Such funds are a good place to park cash you have in your brokerage account that you may want to use at some point to buy equities or bonds, McBride said. Money market funds are not FDIC-insured, but any brokerage you use should be insured by the\u00a0Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which\u00a0covers your funds up to a limit if your brokerage ever goes under. Certificates of deposit CDs are still a great place to park any money you can leave untouched for a fixed\u00a0period of time \u2014 anywhere from a few months to five years or longer. As of June 11, the average rate was 4.971% on an online one-year CD, and 3.815% on a five-year CD, according to DepositAccounts.com. While your brick-and-mortar bank may offer a CD at a good rate, you may get a better one shopping around. The easiest way to do that without having to set up an additional account at another bank is to shop for CDs through your online brokerage, which is likely to offer a wide array of CDs from many different banks. At Schwab.com, for instance, CDs on offer ranging in duration from three months all the way up to 10 years offered average annual returns over 5%, with most ranging between 5.30% and 5.45%. The highest annual average was 5.56% for a three-month CD. If you have to withdraw money before the end of a CD\u2019s term, you can always get all of your principal back but may forfeit some of the interest earned as an early withdrawal penalty. Treasury bills and notes Beyond deposit accounts, investing in short-term Treasury bills and intermediate-term Treasury notes has been another way to earn a competitive return with virtually no risk since Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Treasury bills come in six different maturities: 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 13 weeks, 17 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks. Treasury notes mature in two, three, five, seven or 10 years. \u201cAs long as the Fed holds its rate in the 5.25% to 5.5% range, we expect most Treasury bill yields to hover around 5.25% as well,\u201d said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. But, Martin added, \u201cWhile the timing of rate cuts has been pushed back, we still expect them to arrive later this year, and investors in short-term investments would likely face reinvestment risk.\u201d That\u2019s why he suggests investors consider buying some intermediate-term investments now before rates are cut if they want to lock in a higher yield for some of their money, such as Treasury notes maturing in the next four to 10 years. On Wednesday, yields on Treasury bills were north of 5% and yields on Treasury notes were north of 4%, according to Schwab.com. When deciding whether it makes sense to invest in a CD or a Treasury for the same duration, you might opt for the Treasury if you live in a high-tax state, McBride suggested, since interest on Treasuries is\u00a0exempt from state and local taxes. In all instances, the easiest way to purchase Treasuries and other bonds is to do so through your brokerage account.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/success/saving-under-high-interest-rates/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_business_citigroup-jane-fraser-wall-street", "text": "Three years ago, as the long-struggling Citigroup was in a tailspin over a billion-dollar fat-finger error, the bank announced its next CEO, Jane Fraser. At the time, given Citi\u2019s chronic problems, it might have looked like a classic Glass Cliff hire \u2014 the well-worn corporate strategy of putting a woman in charge just as the business is foundering. Fraser, the first woman ever to run a Wall Street bank, inherited a behemoth that had become a\u00a0laughingstock\u00a0among its peers, hobbled by its unwieldy bureaucracy, a bloated staff and slim profit margins. The fat-finger error \u2014 in which a Citi employee accidentally wired hundreds of millions more than they should have to creditors of Revlon \u2014 was the epitome of the kind of control problems that regulators had been warning the bank about for years. But lately, to the surprise of Citi\u2019s critics, things are looking up. Since September, when Fraser laid out her vision for a more streamlined Citigroup, the bank\u2019s stock has shot up more than 50%. For the first time in nearly two decades, Wall Street appears to be feeling something almost like optimism about America\u2019s third-largest bank. Its stock has outperformed rivals JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America so far this year, and it is expected to report 5% earnings growth for the second quarter this Friday. The bank\u2019s finances are greatly improved, but even the most bullish Citi analysts say Fraser has a long way to go to get the bank\u2019s financial house in order. \u201cThe year 2024 is Jane\u00a0Fraser\u2019s\u00a0midterm exam,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Mike Mayo, senior banking analyst at Wells Fargo. If the subject is architecture, she gets an A-plus for her plan. But, he said,\u00a0\u201cshe gets a grade of B to C for the execution, and she gets a grade of D for the financial results.\u201d Mayo has a long and rocky history with Citi,\u00a0a bank that\u00a0he has relentlessly criticized for its management missteps and aggressive accounting practices. But speaking of Fraser\u2019s tenure, Mayo sounded unusually sanguine about her progress in simplifying Citi\u2019s notoriously labyrinthine corporate structure. He even expects the stock price to double in the next three years. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same arrogant Citigroup of the past half-century,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThey finished a watershed org simplification in seven months \u2026 and this involved 200,000 employees.\u201d On an earnings call this spring, Fraser herself touted the reorg as \u201cthe most consequential set of changes\u201d to Citi\u2019s internal structure, which has already made the bank nimbler and more transparent. Still, Mayo said the bank offers the \u201cworst-in-class efficiency, returns and stock market valuation.\u201d \u201cI think she will pull it off. But I\u2019m also cognizant that as good of an architect as she is, it\u2019s yet to be determined if she can build it,\u201d Mayo said. Of course, Fraser, who took over in March 2021, is still being haunted by the sins of Citi\u2019s past. On Wednesday, the bank was hit with a\u00a0$136 million fine\u00a0from federal regulators, who said the bank has made \u201cinsufficient progress\u201d in fixing problems with data management and risk controls.

{"id": "2024_04_23_cars_electric-vehicle-sales-forecast-iea", "text": "Global electric vehicle sales are set to rise by more than a fifth to reach 17 million this year, powered by drivers in China, according to the International Energy Agency. In a report Tuesday, the IEA projected that \u201csurging demand\u201d for EVs over the next decade was set \u201cto remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport.\u201d It expects half of all cars sold globally to be electric by 2035, up from more than one in five this year, provided charging infrastructure keeps pace. The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs. The agency\u2019s bullish long-term outlook for EVs \u2014 based on current government policies \u2014 comes just days after the world\u2019s biggest battery EV maker Tesla slashed its prices in major markets to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers. Recent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The data \u201cdoes not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars. It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday. The growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers. The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union rose almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. In a statement, Birol said: \u201cRather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.\u201d Despite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats. In the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the world\u2019s biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States. Earlier this month, Tesla posted its first annual drop in sales in nearly four years. The company\u2019s stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year. China\u2019s BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023. Automakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the \u201cpace of the transition to EVs\u2026 will hinge on affordability.\u201d In China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average. \u201cIntensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,\u201d the IEA said. \u201cGrowing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,\u201d it added. Last year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market. \u201cChina is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,\u201d Birol said. Concerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an investigation late last year into China\u2019s state support for EV makers. The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the region\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW. EV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country. By 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA. That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year. \u201cThis shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,\u201d Birol said. The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector. In addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States. Under current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_business_cdk-hack-ransom-tweny-five-million-dollars", "text": "CDK Global, a software firm serving car dealerships across the US that was roiled by a cyberattack last month, appears to have paid a $25 million ransom to the hackers, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The company has declined to discuss the matter. Pinpointing exactly who sends a cryptocurrency payment can be complicated by the relative anonymity that some crypto services offer. But data on the blockchain that underpins cryptocurrency payments also tells its own story. On June 21, about 387 bitcoin \u2014\u00a0then the equivalent of roughly $25 million \u2014\u00a0was sent to a cryptocurrency account controlled by hackers affiliated with a type of ransomware called BlackSuit, Chris Janczewski, head of global investigations at crypto-tracking firm TRM Labs, told CNN. A week after the payment was made, CDK said that it was bringing car dealers back online to its software platform. Cryptocurrency allows for the exchange of digital assets outside of the traditional banking system, but a record of those transactions is accessible on the blockchain. Janczewski did not identify who sent the payment, but three\u00a0other sources closely tracking the incident confirmed that a roughly $25 million payment had been made to BlackSuit affiliates and that CDK was very likely the source of that payment.\u00a0Those sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the investigation. The cryptocurrency account that sent the ransom payment is affiliated with a firm that helps victims respond to ransom attacks, one of the sources said, declining to identify the firm. CDK spokesperson Lisa Finney did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Wednesday and Thursday on the apparent payment. Finney  previously declined to answer questions on the subject.\u00a0CDK CEO Brian MacDonald did not respond to email and LinkedIn messages seeking comment. The ransom payment of $25 million hasn\u2019t been previously reported. Bloomberg\u00a0reported that the hackers had made a multimillion-dollar ransom demand and that the company planned to pay. The ransomware attack that hit CDK in mid-June disrupted thousands of auto dealerships that use the company\u2019s software to manage everything from scheduling to sales and orders.\u00a0CDK\u00a0referred to it as a \u201ccyber incident\u201d in statements to reporters. In a note to clients cited by\u00a0CBS, CDK referred to it as a \u201ccyber ransom event.\u201d CDK said last week that \u201csubstantially all\u201d of the nearly 15,000 car dealerships that use its software across North America were back online to its core management system. Federal officials generally discourage paying a ransom to cybercriminals because payments can fuel future attacks. But some companies feel they have no choice but to pay off hackers to try to recover sensitive customer data or get their systems back online. The payment would be a windfall for a\u00a0relatively new brand\u00a0of ransomware criminals that emerged last year and has claimed numerous victims in the education and construction sectors, among others. BlackSuit\u2019s malicious software is similar to that previously used by other Russian-speaking criminal groups,\u00a0according\u00a0to the US Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cThe gang\u2019s leadership has been conducting ransomware extortion operations since 2019 under other ransomware brand names,\u201d said Jon DiMaggio, chief security strategist at cybersecurity firm Analyst1 who closely studies ransomware gangs. \u201cThis is one of many examples I have seen over the years where a group is either shut down by law enforcement or decides to terminate its operation to rebrand under a new name and continue attacking and extorting organizations,\u201d DiMaggio told CNN, adding that most of BlackSuit\u2019s victims have been in the US. Cybercriminals, in general, extorted a record $1.1 billion in ransom payments from victim organizations around the world last year despite US government efforts to cut off their money flows, Chainalysis, another crypto-tracking firm,\u00a0said in a report\u00a0in February. A $25 million ransom payment is certainly large but not unheard of in the lucrative ransomware economy. UnitedHealth Group, the health care conglomerate whose subsidiary suffered a ransomware attack in February that hobbled pharmacies across the US, paid a $22 million ransom to a different criminal group. But the average ransom payment in the fourth quarter of 2023 was significantly lower: $568,705,\u00a0according\u00a0to cybersecurity firm Coveware.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/business/cdk-hack-ransom-tweny-five-million-dollars/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

Falling gas prices as well as a drop in new and used car prices helped to usher in the first month-on-month decline since May 2020, BLS data showed. On an annual basis, consumer prices are increasing at their slowest pace since June 2023, matching the lowest annual rate since early 2021. The better-than-expected inflation report further bolstered hopes that a Federal Reserve rate cut could come sooner than later and help make borrowing money less expensive. Interest rates have been planted for months at a 23-year high as a result of the central bank\u2019s inflation-fighting campaign. \u201cWith another good CPI print under their belt, the window is open for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates as early as September, and potentially again in December, assuming the inflation data continues to cooperate,\u201d Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital, wrote Thursday in a note to clients. Economists were expecting a 0.1% monthly increase and an annual gain of 3.1%, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Excluding energy and food prices, a closely watched \u201ccore\u201d index of underlying inflation also slowed more than expected. The core CPI rose 0.1% from May \u2014 its slowest pace since August 2021 \u2014 nudging the annual rate of core inflation lower, to 3.3% from 3.4%, and marking a fresh three-year low. US stocks jumped on the news but quickly gave up those initial gains and settled lower. The blue-chip Dow\u00a0fell 90 points in morning trading. The S&P 500 dipped into negative territory and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was flat. US Treasury yields fell, which could be good news for consumers: Loans like mortgages are tied to the 10-year yield. Odds of Fed cutting are growing \u2014 but so are the risks Wall Street is growing increasingly confident that cooling inflation will allow the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in the coming months. Investors are now pricing in an 89% chance of at least one rate cut by the September 17-18 Fed meeting, according to CME Group\u2019s\u00a0FedWatch Tool. That\u2019s up from 73% on Wednesday and around 50% a week ago. The Fed\u2019s calculus also has shifted somewhat, as the US labor market has become noticeably cooler, with unemployment ticking up for three months in a row to land at 4.1% in June. \u201cIt would be perfectly reasonable, in our opinion, to cut rates in July; however, the Fed is bound by its forward guidance and backward-looking mantra and won\u2019t move until September,\u201d Tuan Nguyen, economist at RSM US, told CNN in an interview on Thursday. \u201cAnything after that will put the economy at serious risk of hitting a hard landing.\u201d Shelter inflation eases While falling gas prices did a fair share of the heavy lifting in cooling inflation, the latest CPI showed progress in a critical area: Shelter. \u201cShelter\u00a0and services costs have been the longstanding and persistent trouble spots in the inflation readings, but maybe the tide is starting to turn,\u201d Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, said in a statement. The shelter index rose just 0.2% during June, the slowest monthly increase in three years. On an annual basis, shelter-related price-hikes rose 5.2%, the coolest reading in two years but still running above overall inflation. Shelter inflation remains the biggest hurdle to CPI slowing (the category itself is about one-third of the overall CPI). Economists have anticipated a slowdown for quite some time now, as market-rate rents have slowed, but how they\u2019re recorded in the CPI comes with a significant lag, and tabulating overall housing cost inflation is an amorphous process of estimating the rental value of owner-occupied homes. Cheaper hotel and motel prices helped in the sharp cooling of the overall shelter index (they fell 2.5% for the month); however, rent and owners\u2019 equivalent rents both slowed on a monthly and annual basis. \u201cToday, the shelter component has finally caught up with what we have been predicting for more than a year now,\u201d RSM\u2019s Nguyen said. \u201cAnd that [moderation] should continue to be the case in the second half of the year.\u201d Retailers cutting prices for cost-wary consumers In recent months, a slew of major retailers have announced price cuts. That trend very well could continue as consumers become more restrained, House said. \u201cI think you have seen consumers feel and act increasingly strained, and that\u2019s going to make it harder for businesses to pass on prices as we moved throughout the year,\u201d Wells Fargo\u2019s House told CNN earlier this week. \u201c[Discounting] also pressures other retailers. If they want to keep their share of the pie, they\u2019re going to have to compete more on price, given that consumers are more squeezed at this stage of the cycle.\u201d Core goods prices fell on a monthly basis by 0.1% and are down 1.8% for the 12 months ended in June, according to Thursday\u2019s BLS report. Food prices saw a modest uptick last month, rising 0.2% overall with grocery and restaurant prices increasing 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively. Long-lasting effects of high inflation Prices may not be rising as quickly as they have been, but that might not bring much solace to American households who see that the overall CPI is a good 20% higher than it was in February 2020. (In recent history, that index would typically rise about 10% over a 54-month period, BLS data shows). The sticker shock of the past three years could leave a lasting impression on consumer behavior, said Michael Weber, an associate professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business who has studied how inflation surges affect consumer behavior. \u201cFor many consumers, when we look at the price tags, walking down the aisles of the supermarket, that price tag compared to two, three years ago will be permanently higher, given the cumulative inflation we\u2019ve witnessed over the last three years,\u201d Weber told CNN in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s ingrained in the memory,\u201d he added. The Fed closely monitors gauges of near-, medium- and long-term inflation expectations as those could be self-fulfilling prophecies for consumers: If people think prices will be higher in the future, they might spend more now or even demand higher wages. In turn, businesses faced with higher costs might end up raising prices as a result. While Americans\u2019 near-term inflation expectations have lessened, the fallout from high prices is being seen on a grander stage: The US presidential election. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t economists, they don\u2019t think like economists, they don\u2019t look at the rate of change in consumer prices \u2026 they\u2019re looking at how much a dozen eggs cost now compared to two years ago,\u201d Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, told CNN. \u201cThis is really where I think Biden has gotten dinged by, in terms of his public image of his handling of the economy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/economy/us-cpi-consumer-inflation-june/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

But today, I have some news of my own to share,\u201d Cipri\u00e1n-Matthews announced in a memo to employees. \u201cAfter much consideration, I\u2019ve decided this is the right time to step away from my current role at CBS News and begin to write my next chapter.\u201d The sudden move comes just months before the high stakes 2024 presidential election, leaving the Tiffany Network\u2019s news organization without a top boss to guide it through the pivotal moment. Wendy McMahon, chief executive of CBS News and Stations, said in a separate memo to staffers that Cipri\u00e1n-Matthews will move into a newly created role as senior editorial adviser helping to guide the outlet\u2019s politics coverage during the election. The announcement also comes days after Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS News, accepted an offer from Hollywood production studio Skydance Media that will see the two companies merge. Following the merger, Skydance Media plans to install its own leadership team. Cipri\u00e1n-Matthews alluded to the corporate uncertainty in her memo to staff. \u201cSome may be asking why I\u2019m announcing this now. We all know our industry and company are going through a transformation and a number of short- and long-term decisions need to be made,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI do not want to be disingenuous with any of you about who should drive these decisions. I\u2019ve always leaned into my integrity and my values and I felt it was important to be transparent at this juncture about my plans.\u201d \u201cIngrid will transition into this new role over the next few weeks, and we will share more updates soon,\u201d McMahon said. When she took over as CBS News president, Cipri\u00e1n-Matthews became the first Latina to hold the influential post at the network\u2019s news division. Her short run came after Neeraj Khemlani stepped down after a brief two-year stint, during which he become the subject of a human resources probe. The decision by Cipri\u00e1n-Matthews to vacate her role means that two of the nation\u2019s biggest television broadcast news organizations will be without a chief heading into the November elections amid a particularly turbulent period in the media industry. Earlier this year, Disney ousted Kim Godwin as ABC News chief and has yet to announce a replacement.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/media/cbs-news-president-ingrid-ciprian-matthews-stepping-down/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment (CSSE) revealed in a filing that it has nearly $1 billion in debt and owes millions of dollars to several entertainment companies including the BBC and Sony Pictures, plus to retailers ranging from Walmart to Walgreens. Filings show that the company took on about $325 million in debt following its purchase of Redbox in 2022 from private equity giant Apollo Global Management. The plan was to make it into an entertainment conglomerate, combining the DVD rental business with its free streaming services, like Crackle, the entertainment platform once owned by Sony. Those plans didn\u2019t pan out, hindered by dual Hollywood strikes that limited production of fresh content and the decline of people renting physical DVDs that even forced rival Netflix to quit that part of its business last year. CSSE declined to comment. Deadline previously reported that Redbox hadn\u2019t paid employees for a week, and medical benefits have been suspended. Filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy could help the company fix those issues if its plans are approved by a court in Delaware. The company\u2019s publishing arm, which produces those ubiquitous self-help books that were once a worldwide phenomenon, isn\u2019t affected by the bankruptcy filing of its entertainment unit.

U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson in San Francisco ruled on Tuesday that the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act governing benefit plans did not cover the former employees\u2019 claims, and therefore she lacked jurisdiction. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. Musk\u2019s lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests. The case is one of many accusing Musk of reneging on promises to former Twitter employees, including\u00a0former Chief Executive Parag Agrawal, and vendors after buying the company for $44 billion in October 2022. Musk also runs the electric car company Tesla, and is the world\u2019s richest person, according to Forbes magazine. According to the\u00a0complaint, Twitter\u2019s 2019 severance plan called for employees who stayed on after the buyout to receive two or six months of pay, plus one week of pay for each year of employment, if they were laid off. The plaintiffs Courtney McMillian, who oversaw Twitter\u2019s compensation and benefits, and Ronald Cooper, an operations manager, said Twitter instead offered fired employees just one month of pay as severance, with no benefits. Thompson said ERISA didn\u2019t apply to Twitter\u2019s post-buyout plan because there was no \u201congoing administrative scheme\u201d where the company reviewed claims case-by-case, or offered benefits such as continued health insurance and out placement services. \u201cThere were only cash payments promised,\u201d she wrote.

{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices", "text": "Actress Judy Garland never recorded her voice to read an audiobook of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but you\u2019ll soon be able to hear her rendition of the children\u2019s novel that inspired the movie nonetheless. Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_economy_fast-food-value-meal-prices", "text": "Value is the new buzzword at fast-food chains nationwide. After rising prices turned customers off, the restaurants recently responded by unveiling value menus. For instance, McDonald\u2019s has a $5 value meal, which includes a McDouble cheeseburger\u00a0or a McChicken sandwich, plus small french fries, 4-piece chicken nuggets and a small soft drink. At Taco Bell, you can now get two different kinds of tacos, a five-layer burrito, chips with nacho cheese sauces and a medium drink for $7. That\u2019s 55% cheaper than ordering the items individually. Like McDonald\u2019s, Burger King is offering a $5 meal bundle where customers can select one of three kinds of burgers to pair with chicken nuggets and a beverage. But just how much value is there in these kinds of \u201cvalue\u201d meals? Well, actually, not as much as you may think, since prices for many key ingredients used in value meals are coming down. In other words: You\u2019re paying the going rate (or more). Cheese, potatoes and tomatoes are getting cheaper Many of the recently announced value meals use cheese, potatoes and tomatoes. Compared to last June, cheese prices are down 2.1%, tomato prices are down 1.1% and potato prices are down 3.9%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 latest Consumer Price Index report released Thursday. On a monthly basis, cheese prices didn\u2019t change in June. Tomato and potato prices slid by 0.3% and 3.3%, respectively, when adjusting for seasonality. Meat eaters benefit the most from the value meal war If you eat meat, you\u2019re more likely to benefit from some value menu items. That\u2019s because meat prices are up 3.5% for the year. From May to June, though, meat prices fell by 0.3%. Beef prices were among the steepest price increases across all meat categories tracked in the CPI. For instance, beef roast prices are up 10% and ground beef prices are up 4.5% compared to last June. Pork prices are also up 3.8% compared to a year ago. But prices are a bit lower compared to last month. Chicken prices rose more modestly over the course of the year, up just 0.5%. On a monthly basis, they fell by 0.2% in June. Given that meat prices are rising at a faster pace than most foods, it\u2019s no wonder most fast-food chains are only offering value menus for a limited time. In effect, they\u2019re maintaining their ability to raise prices in the future. But for the time being, Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald\u2019s USA, said value meals aren\u2019t a loss leader for the company and that \u201cwe are totally comfortable with the profitability of it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a way to really bring value and affordability to our customers at a time when the consumer is really stretched,\u201d he said at a conference hosted by The Wall Street Journal last month. Dining out remains a luxury for many Another consideration: It\u2019s a lot more expensive to dine out than cook at home. That shouldn\u2019t be surprising since there are a lot more costs associated with dining out \u2014 one of the biggest being labor \u2014 that aren\u2019t incurred at home. But you\u2019re likely to experience more sticker shock dining out than shopping at grocery stores. Last month, food prices overall rose by 0.2% from May. For the year, food prices are up 2.2%. Food in stores cost 1.1% more compared to a year ago, and those prices are up 0.1% on a monthly basis. Menu prices at restaurants and cafes are up 4.1% annually and 0.4% from May to June.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/economy/fast-food-value-meal-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

Dozens of Dollar General workers and customers have been killed at stores over the past decade, and the company has faced worker protests and millions in fines from regulators for unsafe store conditions. The Labor Department said Dollar General agreed to hire new safety managers, provide safety and health training to workers and develop a safety and health committee. Dollar General will also reduce merchandise levels in stores to prevent blocked fire exits. The agreement also requires Dollar General to correct any safety violations related to blocked exits or access to fire extinguishers and electrical panels within 48 hours. Dollar General could face fines up to $500,000 per violation. \u201cThese changes help give peace of mind to thousands of workers, knowing that they are not risking their safety in their workplaces and that they will come home healthy at the end of each day,\u201d Douglas Parker, the head of the Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health division, said in a statement. This settlement resolves existing contested inspections as well as open federal inspections involving alleged violations. Dollar General did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Last year, the Labor Department agreed to a settlement with Dollar Tree to improve worker safety in stores. Both chains have a low-cost business model, allowing them to keep their prices down and open in areas competitors like Walmart and Target have bypassed. But this model often means only one or two workers making the minimum wage oversee stores at a time, making it nearly impossible for employees to stock shelves and keep stores well maintained. Dollar General is the fastest-growing retailer in the United States, with more than 19,000 small stores.

{"id": "2024_07_06_business_electric-nascar-race-car-unveiled", "text": "NASCAR racing is all about loud, fast cars burning gas and rubber around a track. But on Saturday, NASCAR unveiled something different: an all-electric SUV that has twice as much horsepower as any of their current gas guzzlers. It\u2019s a sign of just how far electric vehicles have come that even a sport better known for its adherence to tradition is entertaining embracing the technology \u2013 even if, for now, the new car is just a prototype. In some ways, it looks like what you\u2019d expect from NASCAR. It\u2019s colorful with big wheels and a wing on the back to help the vehicle hold the road at high speeds. But, if NASCAR is known for anything, it\u2019s the loud V8 internal combustion engines that power the race car. NASCAR executives insist they have no plans to turn away from fuel-burning power any time soon. \u201cThe combustion engine is our core product, and that will remain so for the coming future,\u201d said Riley Nelson, NASCAR\u2019s head of sustainability. But this vehicle, a fully drivable prototype, provides a way for NASCAR to gauge fan interest in electric cars. The racing crossover has three electric motors \u2014 one driving the front wheels and two the back \u2014 capable of producing a maximum of 1,300 horsepower, almost double the horsepower of NASCAR\u2019s current gasoline-powered race cars. Some passionate NASCAR fans will, no doubt, reject the very idea of electric racing, said John Probst, NASCAR\u2019s senior vice president of racing development. That\u2019s why NASCAR wants to make it very clear that gasoline-burning race cars are in no immediate danger of extinction. This is also an opportunity to open minds to what could be something exciting in the future. NASCAR\u2019s own research with fans indicated that many are curious to know more about electric vehicles and could see EV racing as a way to learn about them, he said. Once fans see the speed and excitement of an electric cars, which can be more powerful and faster than gas cars, he thinks even the most anti-EV fans will drop some of their objections. The NASCAR EV prototype was built in cooperation with ABB, a company that\u2019s involved in building electric vehicle infrastructure, such as power equipment for chargers. ABB is also heavily involved in Formula E, the electric racing series affiliated with Formula 1. Involvement in racing like this hopefully generates interest in EVs and shows what they\u2019re capable of, said Michael Plaster, ABB\u2019s executive vice president for electrification in the US. The hope is that exciting track performance can sell electric cars. NASCAR introduced a broader initiative last year to reduce its overall net carbon emissions to zero by 2035. Racing itself represents only a small part of the organization\u2019s overall carbon emissions, said Nelson. For now, most of that initiative has to do with reducing emissions from office space, transportation and operations at the 15 NASCAR-owned tracks. \u201cThe pilot programs that we\u2019ve implemented within operations of our core business, and then also the events, has been going really well,\u201d she said, \u201cand we know where we need to go but we\u2019re still in the early stages of this journey.\u201d Currently, NASCAR cars run on fuel that is 85% gasoline and 15% ethanol but, in the next few years, NASCAR plans to announce a more sustainable racing fuel that can still be burned in loud V8 engines. The original idea behind NASCAR, the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, was that it was supposed to involve cars similar to what Americans drive on the road. With many changes over the years, modern NASCAR race cars bear little resemblance to the Toyotas and Chevrolets that typical Americans own. This time, designers wanted to maintain that resemblance between the race car and the vehicles fans drive, which are, increasingly, SUVs. Today, traditional cars \u2014 as opposed to SUVs, trucks or vans \u2014 make up less than 20% of US auto sales, according to Cox Automotive. \u201cWe actually have the opportunity to evaluate not just the battery electric part, but then also the crossover vehicle part,\u201d said Probst. \u201cSo, it may be that one or both of these will become something in the future for us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/business/electric-nascar-race-car-unveiled/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_17_success_how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges", "text": "Long before you take your high schooler on college campus tours, consider this: Shopping for college shouldn\u2019t be any different than shopping for a home.\u00a0When you want to buy a home, you come up with a range of how much you can afford and get pre-qualified for a mortgage. Then you look in neighborhoods that offer homes that meet your family\u2019s needs and fall within your price range. \u201cAdopt a mindset that we\u2019re buying college like we\u2019re buying a house,\u201d said Beth Walker, author of \u201cBuying College Better\u201d and \u201cNever Pay Retail for College.\u201d As a financial adviser and certified\u00a0college planning specialist, Walker tries to help families avoid a situation that many find themselves in at the 11th hour: Their child applies \u2014 and gets into \u2014 schools they cannot afford because the schools won\u2019t give them enough aid. And then they just \u2026 try to make it work, no matter how much debt is involved for the parents or the student. Instead, she advises families to start as early as 9th or 10th grade in figuring out what is affordable for them as a family \u2014 so parents don\u2019t sacrifice their own financial welfare and the future college student doesn\u2019t drown in debt upon graduation. And second, she recommends assessing how a child\u2019s talents and interests pare with majors and careers they might want to pursue. Doing both those things can help you target the right colleges to apply to. Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners, defines the perfect college as one \u201cwhere a student can go be happy, safe and successful, graduate in four years or less with a marketable degree and little or no debt.\u201d In helping families align parents\u2019 affordability constraints with their student\u2019s academic and social needs, he cautions them not to automatically assume the Ivys or other high-prestige schools will be best simply because of their status. And he stresses what success in life looks like after college and notes that an Ivy League degree isn\u2019t the only path to achieving it, especially if your child won\u2019t get much aid to attend. In fact, said Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, a lot of brand-name schools don\u2019t even offer merit-based aid, only need-based. So if you\u2019re not rich, but you make too much to qualify for need-based aid, you could find yourself having to cover the entire cost of tuition, room and board every year, which is pushing $90,000 at some US colleges. Set up financial guardrails well before the college search Fothergill created a free calculator called CostHero that lets parents assess what financial resources they will have available to pay for a child\u2019s college education. It then provides a range of affordability: At the low end is the number representing what they can pay if they don\u2019t take on debt. And at the high end is the number they can pay if they also take out an unsubsidized federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). \u201cIf you\u2019re not in a position to write a check for $90,000 a year, put up guardrails for yourself so you don\u2019t blow up your retirement,\u201d he said. The calculator inputs let you set the amount of resources you\u2019re willing to use to pay for college from your income and savings, your child\u2019s earnings from summer jobs, any family gifts, and any federal Stafford loans your child may take. It also factors in if you qualify for the federal American Opportunity Tax Credit. That credit, for qualified educational expenses, will reduce your tax bill or increase any refund you have coming. The calculator also gives you a debt-to-income score like the kind a mortgage lender might use to assess whether you\u2019re a good credit risk. Ideally, he said, you don\u2019t want your housing costs to exceed 36% of your gross income and your total debt \u2014 including debt from housing, cars, credit cards and any parental education loans \u2014 to exceed 43%. If your DTI ratio is close to or higher than 43% that is a sign you could get yourself into trouble if you end up having any financial problems while your child is in college, Fothergill said. \u201cIf folks have a way to determine the range of affordability prior to the onset of the college search, the outcomes are a lot better.\u00a0 For example, if one knows that the range of affordability is between $30,000 [a year] with no parent debt and $50,000 with parent debt, then any college that comes in with a net cost in that range is, by definition, affordable,\u201d Fothergill said. Net cost refers to the true cost of attendance after figuring out how much aid your child may get (e.g., grants and scholarships). Figure out where your student may qualify for the most aid Generally speaking, the biggest tuition discounts go to the most academically accomplished students in an incoming class. \u201cThe student needs to be in the top 25% of those admitted,\u201d Walker said. Getting into that top 25% cohort is based on SAT or ACT scores, and having a high, unweighted GPA based on a rigorous high school curriculum. The curriculum\u2019s academic rigor can be further bolstered by taking AP courses. Since your child is more likely to make the top quartile at some schools than others, Fothergill and Walker both recommend your child focus on applying only to those schools in which they stand the best chances of being in that top group to maximize their chances for merit-based aid. Otherwise, you\u2018ll spend money to apply to guidance-counselor-recommended \u201csafety\u201d schools or \u201creach\u201d schools with no sense if those places are affordable to you should your child get in. Using reported data from admissions officers about their key criteria in admitting an incoming class and based on what more than 1,000 schools report about the qualifications they used to grant aid, Fothergill created another tool called ListHero. It gives students a score that helps gauge\u00a0how competitive their profile is\u00a0at a given school, relative to others admitted, and by extension their eligibility for tuition discounts. Right now the tool is only available to college planning professionals for a fee. But Fothergill plans to create a free mini-version for consumers to use. For parents doing their own research on test scores, GPA requirements, costs and aid, he recommends checking the Department of Education College Scorecard, the site CollegeData.com and the College Board. Other ways to reduce college costs before applying While your children are in high school they can take other steps to reduce the total cost of their education. One way is by doing well on the PSAT to qualify to compete for a National Merit Scholarship. Another is to take AP courses. If their high school doesn\u2019t offer them, there is a program called Freshman Year for Free offered by the Modern States Education Alliance. It provides free AP placement courses and pays the fee for students to take the AP tests or college-level preparation (CLEP) tests administered through the College Board. Getting the minimum AP scores a college requires to earn a college credit will lower how much you ultimately have to spend on tuition. A third option is to see if your state has a program that offers a year of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to a state university from which your child could earn their degree. Or, if you plan to go to any other college, make sure the school will accept the credits from a community college course you plan to take. No matter what steps you take, starting the research and budgeting process early can save everyone a lot of stress, debt and potential heartache in the end. Said Walker: \u201cWe have to be a lot more intentional about this purchase.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/success/how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

Tractor Supply also warned that it could suffer similar business consequences if it did not meet its five-year diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) plan to increase spending by 35% with diverse suppliers and boost representation of people of color at manager levels and above at the company by 50%. Hal Lawton, the chief executive of the Brentwood, Tennessee-based company, had said these initiatives \u201cmake great business sense for Tractor Supply.\u201d But Tractor Supply has decided that all of those risks are now worth ignoring.

It will also stop sponsoring LGBTQ+ Pride festivals and voting campaigns, as well as submitting data to the Human Rights Campaign, one of the biggest LGBTQ+ non-profit advocacy groups in the United States. By walking away from diversity and climate goals, Tractor Supply has become the latest corporate giant to retreat from progressive initiatives it once promoted, joining Bud Light, Target and others.

Tractor Supply is \u201ctrying to thread the needle,\u201d said Nooshin Warren, a professor of marketing at the University of Arizona who studies corporate activism and corporate political culture. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to keep both sides happy, which usually never happens.\u201d Tractor Supply, she noted, has become a more diverse company in recent years, and the company\u2019s decision could alienate employees. Racial and ethnic minorities make up 18% of its approximately 50,000 employees and 33% of its board of directors, and it has earned strong ratings from the Human Rights Campaign for LGBTQ+ inclusive policies. Tractor Supply\u2019s reversal came after Robby Starbuck, who in 2022 launched a failed bid for Tennessee\u2019s 5th Congressional District and now hosts a podcast, waged a weeks-long campaign on X calling on customers to boycott Tractor Supply and contact its corporate leadership over the company\u2019s LGBTQ+ and DEI hiring initiatives. \u201cIt\u2019s time to expose Tractor Supply,\u201d he first posted June 6, drawing attention to corporate components like \u201cLGBTQIA+ events at work\u201d and \u201ca DEI council.\u201d Other conservative political candidates, activists and customers began criticizing the company on social media, and said they would stop shopping at the chain. \u201cWe have heard from customers that we have disappointed them,\u201d Tractor Supply said. \u201cWe have taken this feedback to heart.\u201d \u201cGoing forward,\u201d Tractor Supply said, \u201cwe will ensure our activities and giving tie directly to our business.\u201d The company said that although it\u2019s ending DEI goals and carbon emissions goals, it will still ensure a \u201crespectful environment\u201d and focus on land and water conservation efforts. But Tractor Supply\u2019s reversal has already caused outcry. The National Black Farmers Association, a non-profit advocacy group representing 130,000 Black farmers and their families, has called for Lawton\u2019s resignation and said the company has \u201clittle respect for (Black) farmers.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re sending the wrong signal to America at the wrong time in history,\u201d John Boyd, the president of the organization, told CNN. \u201cAmerica isn\u2019t just white men. It\u2019s made up a lot of different people. They have a lot of people they\u2019re offending.\u201d Boyd, a fourth-generation farmer who is a Tractor Supply shareholder and customer and buys feed, mineral blocks and fencing frequently from the chain, said many Black farmers rely on Tractor Supply for their suppliers. He feels the company \u201ccaved to hard right-wing nonsense\u201d and plans to stop shopping at the chain. A Tractor Supply store manager in upstate New York who is gay resigned and told the town newspaper that the company \u201cbetrayed\u201d employees and customers. Tractor Supply declined to comment on these statements. Tractor Supply\u2019s customer base Tractor Supply has a broad customer base. The company has more than 2,400 stores in 49 states and targets recreational farmers, ranchers, animal and pet owners who primarily live in towns outside major metropolitan areas and in rural communities. Rural areas tend to be more politically conservative than urban areas. In 2020, Republican candidate Donald Trump won 65% of rural voters, according to Pew. But suburban areas are more politically divided \u2014 in 2020, Democratic candidate Joe Biden won 54% of suburban voters. Tractor Supply\u2019s customer base has historically been primarily older men, who lean Republican, but Tractor Supply has increasingly tried to draw Millennials and women, who tend to favor Democrats. Since the pandemic, the company has gained ground with younger consumers who moved out of cities. \u201cCustomer demographic trends continue to trend younger and more female than pre-pandemic,\u201d Lawton said last year. Tractor Supply\u2019s reversal could hurt it with these customers, who could be crucial as the company\u2019s historic base ages out of the market. \u201cTractor Supply Co. is turning its back on their own neighbors with this shortsighted decision,\u201d Eric Bloem, vice president of Programs and Corporate Advocacy at the Human Rights Campaign, told CNN in a statement Saturday. \u201cLGBTQ+ people live in every zip code in this country, including rural communities. We are shoppers, farmers, veterans and agriculture students.\u201d Squirrelwood Equine Sanctuary, a New York animal sanctuary that says it spends more than $65,000 annually at Tractor Supply, said it plans to stop shopping at the chain. \u201cWe never asked for a pride flag out front. We do expect respect and inclusion. You have lost our business and every shred of respect we might have had,\u201d the non-profit said on X. Corporate America\u2019s retreat Particularly after the May 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, companies rolled out policies aimed at diversifying their workforces and welcoming customers from all backgrounds. But Tractor Supply\u2019s reversal is part of a larger corporate retreat on DEI programs and environmental goals. Many of these efforts are now under attack from right-wing activists, businessmen such as Bill Ackman and Elon Musk, and others. The backlash also comes amid a wave of legislation in Republican-led states to curtail LGBTQ rights and cut DEI programs in colleges and universities, alongside lawsuits to stop 401(k) managers from considering climate change and other environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors when selecting investments. Right-wing groups have threatened boycotts against brands like Bud Light, Disney and Nike to roll back their inclusivity efforts. They\u2019ve even gone after Chick-fil-A for its diversity programs and Cracker Barrel for selling plant-based sausages, brands traditionally seen as conservative. Last year, Bud Light\u2019s partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked an anti-trans backlash and a months-long boycott of the beer brand, throughout which the company failed to take a firm stance in support of Mulvaney and the transgender community. The boycott and the subsequent tepid response lost parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev as much as $1.4 billion in sales, as well as its credibility with a major LGBTQ+ non-profit. Last month, retailer Target said it will limit how many stores would carry its Pride-themed collection for adults after a boycott from right-wing activists last summer led to a sharp dip in sales. Many companies are \u201cturning back,\u201d said Nooshin Warren from the University of Arizona. \u201cIt seems that retracting is now the trend.\u201d CNN\u2019s Eva Rothenberg contributed to this article.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/business/tractor-supply-dei-climate-lgbtq/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
