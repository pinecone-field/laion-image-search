{"id": "2024_05_25_business_burger-prices-memorial-day", "text": "Burger patties, buns and ketchup prices are high. But even with the increases, your home-grilled burger could end up being relatively inexpensive this year thanks to steep discounts offered by retailers vying for budget-conscious customers. In recent months, grocery prices have stayed flat and even started to fall. But some grilling staples are more expensive compared to last year. In the 12 months through April 21, ground beef prices rose 6.4% by volume compared to the period from a year earlier, according to US retail sales data from Circana. Packaged hamburger and hot dog bun prices were up 7% while potato chips were up 6.9%. Condiment prices saw a sharper jump with ketchup rising 8.9%, hot sauce increasing 7.6% and regular barbecue sauce spiking 14.6%. Some items had modest increases, like hot dogs, which went up by 1.4%. But the increases don\u2019t take into account the year\u2019s many Memorial Day deals. \u201cThis is going to be a year for aggressive discounting,\u201d said Chris DuBois, EVP and practice leader for the fresh foods practice at Circana. Retailers \u201cwant to win the customer trip,\u201d he said. \u201cI would expect pretty sharp discounts to be able to bring people in.\u201d It\u2019s discount season Retailers often offer sale prices ahead of major holidays in order to lure in customers. For stores, it can be worthwhile to break even, or take a loss, on certain discounted items in order just to get people in the door. Once inside, shoppers may well fill up their carts with full-priced items. But if they don\u2019t, at least they won\u2019t be shopping at a competitor. This year, in particular, is stacking up to be a really good one for deals. Consumers remain  worried about inflation and have been spending less as a result. Retailers, vying for much-needed foot traffic, have already been slashing prices, and are adding more discounts for the holiday. Target recently said that it is lowering prices on thousands of items. In addition, the big-box retailer is offering a number of Memorial Day deals for a limited time, including buy one, get one 20% off ground beef and burgers for rewards members for May 19-27. Members also get a discount on soda in that period and all customers get a deal on chips. Supermarket chain Kroger also has Memorial Day specials, including reduced rates for home brand sliced cheese, hamburger buns and potato chips. Meanwhile, low-cost grocer Aldi, which has been gaining popularity with its no frills approach and bargain prices, is reducing the prices of steak and chicken breasts through July 10, among other deals. Chicken products are among the items that have gotten less expensive this year, even before discounts. Chicken breast prices, for example,\u00a0fell 2.5% in the year through April, according to Circana, while wings have plunged 9.2%.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/business/burger-prices-memorial-day/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

Investors providing the second-round funding included Sequoia Capital, Andreesen Horowitz, and Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, xAI announced in a blog post on Sunday. Musk, who founded xAI in July last year, wrote Monday on X that there would be \u201cmore to announce in the coming weeks,\u201d and that the startup had a valuation of $18 billion before receiving the new funding. xAI said in its post that the new money would be used to take the firm\u2019s \u201cfirst products to market, build advanced infrastructure, and accelerate the research and development of future technologies.\u201d The funding sets the company up as a potential rival to OpenAI, the AI research group behind the wildly popular chatbot ChatGPT. Musk is a co-founder of OpenAI, but\u00a0stepped down\u00a0as chairman six years ago partly over disagreements about the co\ufeffmpany\u2019s direction. In November, xAI announced that it was developing an AI-powered chatbot called \u201cGrok\u201d for some paying users of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter which Musk also owns. The billionaire said in a post on X at the time that Grok was being trained by having \u201creal-time access\u201d to information on the site. Since then, xAI has announced versions of Grok 1.5 with improved long context and image capabilities, and it is currently recruiting for engineers and researchers in Palo Alto, San Francisco and London. Investors, lured by the potential for AI to revolutionize the way people live and work, have thrown huge sums of money at AI companies in recent years. Microsoft (MSFT) is OpenAI\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the firm. Last year, Amazon (AMZN) announced it would invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic AI in exchange for partial ownership of the company. Bringing AI products to market is far from straightforward for even the biggest players. Earlier this month, Google introduced an AI-generated search tool, which summarizes results so that users don\u2019t have to click through multiple links to get quick answers to their questions. But the feature came under fire after it provided false or misleading information, prompting the company to walk back some factually incorrect results.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/tech/elon-musk-xai-6-billion-funding/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_economy_fed-minutes-wall-street-inflation", "text": "Earlier this week, some officials at the Federal Reserve said they\u2019re no longer worried about inflation reaccelerating, after data showed that progress stalled in the first quarter. Optimism spurred by the latest inflation data pushed all three major stock indexes to new record highs. But now Wall Street, eager for rate cuts, is on edge again. That\u2019s because minutes from the central bank\u2019s latest policy meeting released Wednesday showed that \u201cvarious\u201d officials said they would be willing to raise interest rates if necessary and that there were doubts as to whether financial conditions are restrictive enough to keep inflation from resurging. It spooked investors: The Dow slid more than 300 points following the release of the minutes. Moreover, the Fed minutes seemed to outweigh comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller, a key messenger of monetary policy moves, who told CNBC in an interview Tuesday that the Fed could cut rates by the \u201cend of the year.\u201d In a separate speech earlier that day, he said \u201cthe data suggests that inflation isn\u2019t accelerating.\u201d \u201cMore recent data on the economy indicate that restrictive monetary policy is helping to cool off aggregate demand and the inflation data for April suggests that progress toward 2% has likely resumed,\u201d Waller said at an event hosted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He pointed to recent figures on employment and retail spending coming in weaker than expected, both of which should help take some steam out of inflation. But some financial leaders remain doubtful that the Fed is feeling confident enough to cut rates soon. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said Wednesday at an event hosted by Boston College that the Fed probably won\u2019t begin to cut rates this year. \u201cI\u2019m still at zero cuts,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re set up for stickier inflation.\u201d Some Fed officials say another rate hike isn\u2019t likely Fed officials have mostly sounded a little more optimistic about inflation recently, after the Consumer Price Index for April finally provided some welcome news. The inflation report was mostly in line with expectations, which was an improvement from the disappointing figures for the first three months of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to focus too much on just one data point,\u201d said Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson at an event hosted by the Mortgage Bankers Association on Monday. However, he noted that the April CPI data was nonetheless \u201ca good sign for us.\u201d San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told Axios in an interview that published Monday that she doesn\u2019t \u201csee any evidence right now that we need to adjust upwards.\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month that it may just be a matter of giving high interest rates some time to kick in. \u201cWhat that has told us is that we\u2019ll need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work,\u201d he said during a moderated discussion with European Central Bank Governing Council member Klaas Knot. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester told Bloomberg on Monday that she also thinks interest rates are high enough to deal with inflation. But despite the hopeful Fedspeak on inflation, there is still an uneasiness in the air about what\u2019s really happening and what the central bank will do. \u201cFor now, the Fed says it wants to see more evidence that inflation is easing, which implies higher-for-longer rates until that data materializes,\u201d wrote Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing for E*TRADE in a note Wednesday. \u201cTraders will have to wait until next week\u2019s PCE price index to get another read on inflation and update their expectations for rate cuts,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_05_27_business_summer-box-office-memorial-day", "text": "The summer movie season typically starts with a bang during the month of May and, particularly, during Memorial Day weekend. This year, it\u2019s a whimper. Memorial Day weekend (Friday through Monday) movie ticket sales are estimated at $128.3 million, according to Comscore data provided to CNN. That\u2019s down from last year\u2019s Memorial Day weekend, which recorded just shy of $205 million gross revenue, and it lands well under the record holiday in 2013, when \u201cFast & Furious 6\u201d drove the weekend to $314.3 million in revenue. In fact, the US box office is on track to have its lowest-grossing Memorial Day weekend since the $117.1 million seen in 1995, when \u201cCasper\u201d haunted the screens \u2014 and that\u2019s not even adjusting for inflation. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to sugarcoat it, the numbers that are coming out this weekend are nothing to write home about,\u201d Paul Degarabedian, senior media analyst with Comscore, told CNN in an interview. \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d was estimated to be the No. 1 movie with $32 million in sales for the weekend. The tepid Memorial Day weekend continues what\u2019s been a lukewarm start to the summer box office, a movie-going season that\u2019s still reeling from the effects of last year\u2019s Hollywood strikes. Coupled with production delays \u2014 the aftershocks of the multi-month-long Writers Guild and SAG-AFTRA strikes that are still reverberating across studios \u2014 the season that has historically drawn the biggest movie theater audiences is off to a rocky start, potentially hurting the yearly box office totals for 2024. \u201cSummer is the most important moviegoing season of the year, accounting on average for nearly 40% of the total domestic annual revenue, so as goes the summer so goes the year,\u201d Dergarabedian said. Last\u00a0summer, blockbusters \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d\u00a0combined added nearly a billion dollars to the domestic box office, according to Comscore data. But this year, studios are betting on a large slate of mid-range sequels and prequels, as well as family-focused animated films to fill the Barbenheimer-shaped hole, including \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga,\u201d \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2.\u201d \u201cBarring some major overperformances, this summer looks like it\u2019ll be down 20% to 25% in box office grosses between May and August from last year,\u201d said analyst Shawn Robbins, founder and owner of Box Office Theory. While there was no Marvel movie to kick off this May and no mega-blockbuster for Memorial Day, there\u2019s still potentially a solid pipeline of movies to come this year, Degarabarian said. \u201cWe just now have to count on the films coming out in June and July to really perform \u2014 and there\u2019s some big ones on the horizon,\u201d he said, noting \u201cDespicable Me 4,\u201d \u201cInside-Out 2,\u201d and \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine.\u201d The elusive $100-million opening weekend Until 2020, the period between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day Monday could be counted on to bring in upwards of $4 billion in domestic revenue, according to Comscore data. Summer 2023 saw the first post-pandemic $4-billion summer. Propelled by the success of \u201cSound of Freedom,\u201d \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d and the record-breaking $155 million \u201cBarbie\u201d opening weekend, summer 2023 grossed $4.09 billion, a 19.2% jump from the year prior. \u201cBarbie\u201d was distributed by Warner Bros., which is owned by CNN\u2019s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery. An opening weekend north of $100 million is typically only seen in intellectual property-driven action films like Star Wars movies and superhero flicks, as well as animated family fare like \u201cThe Incredibles 2\u201d and \u201cFinding Dory.\u201d So far this year, no movie has crossed that threshold. \u201cSans a Marvel movie to provide a $100-million-plus opening weekend to get the momentum going, this summer will have to make up ground in June and July,\u201d said Dergarabedian, adding that this summer has so far been a \u201clate bloomer.\u201d Disney offerings could make or break the summer box office Two movies that analysts say could cross the $100 million threshold this summer are \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d both of which are distributed by Walt Disney Studios. The studio\u2019s first wide release of 2024 under its flagship \u201cDisney\u201d banner is set to be \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d an anomaly for the company and the movie business, according to Daniel Loria, editorial director at Box Office Pro, which collects sales and showtimes data from thousands of movie theaters across the United States. (Disney-owned 20th Century Entertainment released its first movie of the year, \u201cThe First Omen,\u201d in April.) \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other year where a studio as vital to this industry sits out the entire first half of the year,\u201d Loria told CNN, adding that this is in large part due to production delays and schedule shifts caused by months of back and forth between studios, the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, the actors\u2019 union. \u201cWe tend to overemphasize the effect of Hollywood\u2019s 2023 labor strikes at the box office, but it\u2019s hard not to cite it when you look at the number of releases to have hit theaters from major studios in the first half of the year.\u201d Disney has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Loria also emphasized that Disney\u2019s summer offerings, both from its Pixar and Marvel divisions, will be critical to how the 2024 box office performs overall. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d is forecast to open anywhere between $80 million and $100 million, according to Box Office Pro pre-sales data. Pixar\u2019s offerings in recent years have fallen flat; 2022\u2019s \u201cLightyear\u201d debuted at $50.5 million domestically, while 2023\u2019s \u201cElemental\u201d made $29.6 million its opening weekend. Meanwhile, \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d the only Marvel property release this summer, is expected to reinvigorate audience enthusiasm after \u201cThe Marvels\u201d disappointed last November with a $47 million opening weekend. Last week, ticket seller Fandango announced that \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d had broken the company\u2019s 2024 record for best first-day ticket presales, beating out \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d The film also had the best first day of ticket sales for an R-rated film in Fandango\u2019s 24-year history, the company told CNN. \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine has the potential to be the second movie (after 2021\u2019s \u201cSpiderman: No Way Home\u201d) to earn a $200 million opening weekend of the post-pandemic era,\u201d said Loria. \u201cWe are still two months out, but if pre-sales and awareness continue at this pace, we believe the film can open between $170 million and $210 million.\u201d \u201cDespicable Me 4\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2\u201d \u201clook particularly strong, and \u2018Deadpool & Wolverine\u2019 will hands down be the top film of the summer,\u201d said Dergarabedian. Studios still trying to find their footing Industry experts agree that the 2024 box office has been sluggish so far, but remain hopeful that the box office can rebound by the end of the year and beyond. \u201cBox office earnings have been down largely because of staggered gaps between widely appealing releases in the first half of the year,\u201d said Robbins. \u201cThat\u2019s been the status quo in the post-pandemic era for many reasons, mostly outside the control of theatrical exhibition. The industry had only a brief period between the impact of COVID production delays followed by the writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strikes last year.\u201d Robbins added that there\u2019s still time for strong titles in the second half of the year to fill the gap, including September\u2019s \u201cBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\u201d and \u201cTransformers One,\u201d and October\u2019s \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.\u201d \u201cMoviegoing habits have changed drastically since the\u00a0pandemic, but we continue to see significant enthusiasm when it comes to the theatrical experience,\u201d said Loria. \u201cThe data clearly shows that audiences can still support the studio tentpole model \u2014 but identifying the movies that will become those blockbuster hits continues to be as difficult to predict as ever before.\u201d Box Office Pro projects that the 2024 box office will gross $8.2 billion, about 10% lower than last year\u2019s $9 billion. The domestic earnings for 2023 were the highest since the pandemic, but still fell roughly $2 billion short of pre-pandemic yearly sales, according to Comscore.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/business/summer-box-office-memorial-day/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

But surging prices in recent years dented the luster of \u201cTar-zhay.\u201d The company reported Wednesday that sales at stores open for at least one year dropped 3.7% during its latest quarter from a year ago. It was the fourth-straight quarter of sales declines at Target (TGT). The company\u2019s stock fell around 7% during pre-market trading. Sales dropped primarily in discretionary categories last quarter, Target said, continuing a trend during the inflation spike in which customers spend on necessary items but pare back on stuff they don\u2019t really need. Target is a bellwether for consumers\u2019 spending habits and the retail sector as a whole. Target\u2019s core middle-class customer base has been strained by higher prices and pulled back on discretionary goods like home decor, electronics and nonessential clothing in favor of groceries and everyday essentials. Target has also slumped because of its merchandise mix and higher prices compared to rivals like Walmart. The chain stocks more non-essential merchandise compared to competitors such as Walmart\u00a0(WMT)\u00a0and Costco\u00a0(COST). More than half of Target\u2019s\u00a0merchandise is discretionary. Target in recent years has added more food and essentials to its stores, but still trails Walmart, which gets around half of sales from groceries. Walmart\u2019s sales increased 3.8% last quarter.

Target\u00a0has slashed prices on more than 1,500 popular items starting Monday, ranging from butter to laundry detergent, as the retailer attempts to attract inflation-wary shoppers turned off by high prices.

{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_homes_sales-us-housing-market", "text": "Rising US home prices are heightening the housing affordability crisis for Americans, especially first-time buyers. The median price of a previously owned home in the US grew 5.7% in April from a year earlier to $407,600, according to data from the National Association of Realtors released Wednesday. That was the fourth consecutive monthly increase and was a record for April prices. Another gauge of prices by S&P Global has similarly showed that US home-price growth accelerated throughout the beginning of the year, especially in San Diego, Chicago and Detroit. Housing affordability takes into account prices, household incomes and mortgage rates. Put together, it\u2019s been a difficult time for prospective buyers, though the increase in prices has been a boon for homeowners since it means their wealth has grown. NAR also reported that existing home sales, which make up the vast majority of transactions, fell 1.9% in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.14 million. Sales fell in April for the second month in a row, declining across the country, as mortgage rates surged past 7%. One shred of good news for housing in America, however, is that more homes are continuing to come to market. \u201cThe upper-end market is experiencing a sizable gain due to more supply coming onto the market,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, NAR\u2019s chief economist, in a release. He added that \u201chome prices reaching a record high for the month of April is very good news for homeowners.\u201d A stalled recovery for the housing market The US housing market\u2019s recovery from earlier in the year was cut short when it became clear the Federal Reserve likely won\u2019t cut interest rates in the first half of 2024 \u2014 right as the crucial spring homebuying season kicked into high gear. After plunging to multi-decade lows last fall, home sales began to rebound in early 2024 as housing supply improved and hopes grew that the Fed would begin to cut interest rates imminently. Then came signs that inflation\u2019s slowdown had stalled. Mortgage rates track the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, which moves in anticipation of the Fed\u2019s decisions on interest rates. Hotter-than-expected inflation readings sent bond yields surging and mortgage rates followed suit. The standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage surged past 7% in April, according to Freddie Mac data. At the same time, home prices continued to climb, tightening the grip on buyers. Low housing affordability typically crimps demand. Yet that somehow didn\u2019t deter some first-time buyers. The share of buyers who bought a home for the first time rose to 33% in April from 32% in March. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they are able to do it,\u201d Yun said. \u201cMaybe later we will find out that they got some help from family members in terms of a down payment.\u201d Housing supply continues to improve America\u2019s housing market indeed remains tough for many, but one key issue has improved throughout this year. A chronic lack of available homes has been a longstanding issue for the market, putting upward pressure on prices and limiting buyers\u2019 choices. The tide seems to have turned for now. Total housing inventory at the end of April was 1.21 million units, up 9% from the prior month and 16.3% from a year earlier, NAR said. That was the fourth consecutive monthly increase in housing inventory, but it\u2019s still not keeping up with demand. \u201cWe still have tight inventory, despite the fact that we\u2019ve had this increase,\u201d Yun said. \u201cIt is still a very frustrating market out there. Home prices are at record highs, mortgage rates are high and a lack of inventory to some degree looks like it is hindering sales.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details and context.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/homes/sales-us-housing-market/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_27_business_south-africa-election-economy", "text": "South Africa\u2019s ruling African National Congress (ANC) swept to power in 1994 on a\u00a0pledge\u00a0to \u201cbuild a better life for all,\u201d winning almost 63% of the vote in the country\u2019s first democratic election. Fast-forward 30 years and\u00a0Nelson Mandela\u2019s\u00a0erstwhile liberation movement, which triumphed over the racist apartheid government, risks losing its parliamentary majority for the first time, according to opinion polls and analysts. When South Africans vote Wednesday, an unhappy combination of rampant corruption, soaring joblessness, crippling\u00a0power cuts\u00a0and feeble economic growth will likely be top of mind. The economy has gone backward over the past decade, evidenced by a sharp fall in living standards. According to the\u00a0World Bank, gross domestic product per capita has fallen from a peak in 2011, leaving the average South African 23% poorer. A third of the labor force is unemployed,\u00a0more than in war-torn Sudan, and the highest\u00a0rate\u00a0of any country\u00a0tracked by the World Bank.\u00a0Income inequality is also the world\u2019s worst. There are 18.4 million people on welfare benefits, compared with just\u00a07 million taxpayers, according to Oxford Economics, a consultancy. Black South Africans, who make up 81% of the population, are at the sharp end of this dire situation. Unemployment and poverty remain concentrated in the Black majority, in large part due to the failure of public schooling, while most White South Africans have jobs and command considerably higher wages. Moreover, the government\u2019s flagship policy for driving economic inclusion and racial equality in post-apartheid South Africa \u2014 Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment, known as triple-BEE or simply BEE \u2014 has failed to achieve its aims, with wealth still concentrated in the hands of a few at the expense of the many. \u201cThree decades after the end of apartheid, the economy is defined by stagnation and exclusion, and current strategies are not achieving inclusion and empowerment in practice,\u201d Harvard University concluded in a report published in November by its Growth Lab following two years of research. \u2018Elite enrichment\u2019 Under apartheid \u2014 and colonial rule before that \u2014 Black South Africans were violently oppressed and denied many basic human rights. They were also systematically excluded from owning land, living in certain areas, and accessing a decent education and jobs. The end of White minority rule could not on its own compensate for such extreme and prolonged injustice. Restitution was needed \u2014 and that\u2019s what BEE set out to deliver. There is now almost universal agreement that the policy failed to transform economic reality for the majority of Black and other South Africans who were historically disadvantaged, including Indians and Coloureds, the official term for South Africans with mixed heritage who have a distinct cultural identity. President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has previously described BEE as \u201ca must for (economic) growth,\u201d promised Saturday the ANC would \u201cdo better\u201d if reelected, with a focus on creating more jobs. The Democratic Alliance, the official opposition party, has said it would replace BEE with an \u201cEconomic Justice policy\u201d that \u201ctargets the poor black majority for redress, rather than a small, connected elite.\u201d Critics of BEE argue there has been an overemphasis on increasing Black ownership of established businesses through giant deals that have, in fact, enriched only a handful of politically connected people. This is a view held by Moeletsi Mbeki, brother of former President Thabo Mbeki and chairman of the South African Institute of International Affairs, an independent think tank located at Wits University in Johannesburg. BEE \u201ccreates a class of rich politicians who are then beholden to the people who are making them rich, but it disincentivizes people from becoming entrepreneurs,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cIf I became president, the first thing I would do would be to scrap BEE,\u201d he added. By Moeletsi\u2019s telling, White executives devised BEE as a way to \u201ccoopt ANC leaders\u201d in the early years of democracy\u00a0by giving them shares in companies that they would then be disinclined to nationalize, a\u00a0policy\u00a0many in the party favored. Still, despite tens of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of BEE deals, Black ownership of companies stands\u00a0at just 34% on average, according to the\u00a0latest report\u00a0by the B-BBEE Commission, which monitors adherence to the policy. \u201cInroads are being made on the participation of Black\u00a0people in the economy, although there is much further to go to realise the objectives (of BEE),\u201d Commission head Tshediso Matona told CNN. Black people are also poorly represented in top management, another\u00a0of the policy\u2019s focus areas. According to a recent\u00a0PwC\u00a0report, just 19% of the 200 most valuable companies listed in Johannesburg are led by Black, Coloured, Indian or Asian CEOs. Many companies in the private sector \u201care not implementing the spirit of the (BEE) legislation\u2026 they\u2019re (only) ticking boxes,\u201d said Kganki Matabane, the CEO of the Black Business Council, a lobby group for Black business. \u201cBusinesses cannot continue to exclude the majority, they\u2019ll render the country ungovernable one day,\u201d he added. Matthew Parks, the parliamentary coordinator for the Congress of South African Trade Unions, an umbrella body for labor unions and an ANC partner, says BEE has helped grow South Africa\u2019s Black middle class but that more must be done for workers, particularly those on minimum wages. He also argues that the policy needs more time to bear fruit. \u201cThree decades given to overcome the impact of three centuries (of White oppression) is not enough.\u201d According to Matona, of the Commission, BEE is \u201conly one part of a suite of policy tools to achieve transformation,\u201d which also includes laws around public procurement, competition, employment equity and skills development. \u201cThe overall outcome of economic transformation requires an assessment of all of these policies,\u201d he said. The sharpest criticism of BEE is that it has been corrupted by private interests, leading to severe maladministration in the public sector.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a huge driver of corruption in the country,\u201d said Mbeki. He and other experts who spoke to CNN explained that\u00a0under the auspices of advancing empowerment, politically connected Black people have\u00a0in some instances\u00a0been put\u00a0into\u00a0senior positions in state-owned companies\u00a0despite not having the right qualifications or experience. Similarly,\u00a0some officials have abused\u00a0public procurement rules\u00a0that favor Black-owned businesses,\u00a0awarding\u00a0government contracts at inflated prices to\u00a0underperforming companies\u00a0in exchange for bribes, a phenomenon sometimes referred to\u00a0locally\u00a0as \u201ctenderpreneurship.\u201d Infrastructure collapse \u201cTenderpreneurship\u201d\u00a0has devastated state-owned companies and local governments across the country, said Ricardo Hausmann, the director of Harvard\u2019s Growth Lab, a hub for research on economic growth and development. \u201cPoor implementation of affirmative action in the public sector\u201d has contributed to \u201ccollapsing state capacity,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe poster child of this is the electricity sector.\u201d For much of last year, South Africans were without power for at least some portion of the day. \u201cLoadshedding\u201d \u2014 as it\u2019s known locally \u2014 hit a new record, with power cuts on 335 days, according to state-owned power utility Eskom. The years-long electricity crisis has abated in recent months, but it is not yet\u00a0over. Widespread graft at Eskom and other government institutions, primarily under former President Jacob Zuma, has been a core reason for the collapse of South Africa\u2019s electricity, transport and, latterly,\u00a0water infrastructure, according to Haroon Bhorat, an economics professor at the University of Cape Town. The result has been to cripple economic activity. Economists estimate that GDP growth could be as high as 3%-5.4% this year were it not for crumbling infrastructure. Instead, the International Monetary Fund forecasts a paltry 0.9% expansion. The \u201cultimate effect\u201d of collapsing infrastructure leading to lower economic\u00a0growth rates is \u201ca governing party that is going to struggle to get urban voters to believe it can turn the economy around,\u201d Bhorat added. South Africa\u2019s economy hasn\u2019t always been in dire straits. For the first 15 years of democracy, the ANC \u201cmanaged the economy relatively well,\u201d Bhorat said. Under Thabo Mbeki, public debt fell considerably and the government even recorded small budget surpluses between 2006 and 2008, meaning it spent less than it received in taxes. Economic growth averaged around 4% a year. In contrast, under Zuma, South Africa\u2019s credit rating was downgraded to junk, or sub-investment grade, by S&P and Fitch. GDP growth averaged around 1.5% a year and the debt-to-GDP ratio more than doubled from a post-apartheid low of 24% in 2008, according to the\u00a0IMF. It is now hovering around 75%. While South Africa was far from perfect under Mbeki \u2014 violent crime was high, the country remained extremely unequal and public services, particularly\u00a0education, needed considerable work \u2014 it had a much stronger economic\u00a0foundation on which to tackle its plentiful post-apartheid challenges. It is that foundation that the country must now painstakingly rebuild. A better future for all? One silver lining to South Africa\u2019s economic crisis is a deepening partnership between government and business to meet the moment. Chief executives from more than 130 major South African companies, including the likes of Investec and Discovery, as well as the local leaders of JPMorgan, Shell and Unilever have formed\u00a0an initiative called\u00a0Business for South Africa. The group holds regular meetings with senior government officials, including President Ramaphosa and heads of state-owned companies, and is undertaking targeted interventions in areas including transport infrastructure and electricity. These\u00a0are already yielding positive results and\u00a0could mean that power cuts are banished for good next year,\u00a0according to Cas Coovadia, the CEO of Business Unity South Africa, the country\u2019s main business lobby group. \u201cThis has proven to be real partnership\u2026 we are making progress,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe whole purpose of this intervention is to stop the slide and give us the space to begin to turn this big ship around.\u201d For Hausmann, of the Harvard Growth Lab, the ANC\u2019s waning influence might be just what the party needs. If political power is more contested, it \u201cputs more of the fear of the wrath of the people into government, so they feel the urgency to improve performance,\u201d he said. \u201cIn general, what disciplines governments is the fear of losing elections.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/business/south-africa-election-economy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

Passenger traffic at US airports is on pace to make this Memorial Day weekend the busiest on record, according to Transportation Security Administration screening data. Following record-setting traveler data for Friday (2.951 million, No. 1 screening day in TSA history) and Thursday (2.897 million, No. 3 ever), more than 2.4 million people passed through TSA checkpoints on each day this weekend. What\u2019s amounting to be a blockbuster Memorial Day weekend could be a precursor to a chart-busting summer of travel. It\u2019s also amounting to a frustrating weekend for many travelers. There have been more than 5,000 flight delays and more than 430 cancelations within, into or out of the United States so far on Monday, according to FlightAware data. The number of flight cancellations is now tracking above the average for last year. Five of the top 10 busiest travel days in the TSA\u2019s 22-year history have occurred in the past two weeks alone. \u201cDuring the\u00a0four-day Memorial Day weekend in 2019, approximately 9.5 million passengers were screened; In 2023, that number rose just above 9.8 million,\u201d Regina Boateng, a TSA spokesperson, told CNN via email. \u201cThis year, we expect the four-day\u00a0figure to rise well above 10 million.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to compare holidays, as some fall on varying days of the week.\u00a0However, TSA expects this summer to also be the busiest in the agency\u2019s history.\u201d Three-plus years of high inflation have\u00a0taken their toll\u00a0on Americans\u2019\u00a0budgets and, especially, their mindsets. But even though people may be\u00a0feeling pinched, some are still willing to spend \u2014 if not splurge \u2014 on travel and leisure. And there is some good news on the inflation front in that regard: Airline fares dropped in April from March and are actually down a little more than 1% from February 2020, Consumer Price Index data shows. Americans aren\u2019t just taking to the slightly cheaper skies: AAA projected that a record 38.4 million people will take road trips over the long weekend. Gas prices rose sharply to start the year but have held fairly steady in recent weeks. On Monday, the national average for a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.59, a penny higher than this time last year, according to AAA. However, the prices at the pump on Monday were cheaper than last Memorial Day as well as the 10-year average for the holiday, according to GasBuddy data. US gasoline demand breached the 9 million barrels for the week ended May 25, according to GasBuddy data. Demand was up just 0.3% from the comparable pre-Memorial Day week last year, Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy spokesman, told CNN on Monday. \u201cIt was a weak start to the week but roared back on [Thursday through Saturday],\u201d he said via email. \u201cStill well below record gasoline demand, however.\u201d Gas Buddy modeled the current demand at just 9.03 million barrels per day. In the late 2010s, specifically 2019, that figure would likely be 9.5 million barrels per day to 9.8 million barrels per day, De Haan said.

{"id": "2024_05_24_business_a-popular-memorial-day-tradition-is-back-hot-deals-on-new-cars", "text": "Memorial Day weekend is shaping up to offer some of the best deals on new cars in years. The discounts vary widely by manufacturer and type of car \u2013 don\u2019t expect too much off on a Toyota SUV, for example. But it\u2019s a good time to be in the market for an electric vehicle. The new car market is finally a buyer\u2019s market again. For decades, the holiday weekend was a great time to buy a new car, with dealers competing to sell out the last of the previous year\u2019s models to make room for incoming new cars. It hasn\u2019t been that way for a while, though. Covid lockdowns disrupted parts supply chains for car factories, making new models often hard to find. It got so bad that, for a while,  almost all cars were routinely selling for above the manufacturers suggested retail price, or MSRP, something that\u2019s normally rare. Deep discounts? They were practically unheard of. Not this year. The auto industry is back pumping out new cars, and dealers are discounting again. Currently Ford dealers are offering average incentives of up to $1,556 on the Ford Bronco, more than six times what they were offering last year, according to data from Cox Automotive. On the GMC Sierra pickup, dealers are offering almost $6,000 on average in incentives, according to Cox. EVs are good buys right now. The Volkswagen ID.4 and Kia Niro EV, for instance, are selling at average discounts of more than 13%, according to Edmunds.com. Zero-percent financing deals for buyers with good credit have also become much more common this year than last, according to Edmunds.com. \u201cA lot more inventory\u2019s out there now,\u201d said Eric Barbosa, business leader for the Cavender Auto Group in San Antonio, Texas. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve got to get rid of these cars.\u201d Making room for the 2025 models It\u2019s not just seasonal sales hype, industry experts say. Dealers really are negotiating deeper discounts than they have in the last few years because they need the space. Overall, new vehicle inventory at dealers is the highest it\u2019s been since late in 2020, according to Cox Automotive. The average discount on a 2023 model year vehicle these days is $4,127, according to Edmunds, which is much deeper than discounts on leftover prior-year models for the last few years. Newer 2024 model year vehicles are selling at an average discount of $1,741. \u201cThere\u2019s a big push to get these \u201923s out and make room for the \u201824s and \u201825s,\u201d said Barbosa. There are more of these prior-year models, meaning 2023 model year vehicles, left than there were this time last year. Vehicles from the outgoing 2023 model year now account for 6.8% of all new vehicles on dealers\u2019 lots, according to Edmunds.com. That\u2019s higher than the percentage of 2022 model year vehicles available around this time last year, and it\u2019s much higher than the 3.7% that were 2021 model year vehicles left for sale this late in 2022. Where are the biggest deals and risks? Bulging vehicle inventories are not evenly distributed, though. Dealerships for some manufacturers have many more unsold vehicles than others. Dealers for Stellantis brands \u2013 Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep and Ram \u2013 are offering the biggest discounts, according to Edmunds.com. These brands are usually sold together in combined dealerships. Dodge is offering some of the biggest discounts in the industry, averaging more than $6,700 per vehicle, according to Edmunds. Chrysler vehicles are selling for an average discount of more than $6,200, while Jeeps are selling at an average of $6,000 off sticker price. Since these figures are averages, that means that not every model in every place will be discounted that much, of course, while some will be discounted more. Here\u2019s one big caveat. A model year may seem like just a number, but shoppers should research carefully to make sure that last year\u2019s model isn\u2019t missing features and improvements introduced on the 2024 version. For example, if you\u2019re considering the Lincoln Nautilus SUV, the 2024 model is entirely redesigned with lots of improvements including a big interior screen and customizable \u201cdigital scenting\u201d to make the cabin smell nice. Also, when it comes time to trade in, the 2023 could be worth less than a 2024 model. \u201cConsumers who prefer to swap their vehicles every few years may want to look elsewhere as these new outgoing models experience heavier immediate depreciation compared to new vehicles from the current model year,\u201d said Edmunds industry analyst Ivan Drury in an email. And not all dealers are offering exciting sales. \u201cToyota, Honda and Kia, there is still so much pent-up demand for these brands, inventory is tight, and sell-through rates are high,\u201d said Brian Finkelmeyer, an industry analyst with Cox Automotive. So you\u2019re unlikely to find big discounts on those vehicles. It will also depend on the type of vehicle you\u2019re looking for, experts say. \u201cThe deals are likely to be had on slower-selling models, specifically sedans and hatchbacks,\u201d said Brian Moody, an industry analyst with Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. \u201cWith compact SUVs selling in higher and higher volumes each year, don\u2019t bother.\u00a0You will likely be paying full sticker price.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/business/a-popular-memorial-day-tradition-is-back-hot-deals-on-new-cars/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_business_nissan-suv-driveway-explosion", "text": "In the early morning of May 14, Vicki Hill was startled awake by the sound of explosions outside her home in Bethesda, Maryland. The loud bangs, she learned later, had come from the airbags of the family\u2019s SUV, a 2015 Nissan Murano that was parked in the driveway. It was on fire. \u201cI thought someone was trying to get into our house with a sledgehammer and I woke my husband up and I said something\u2019s wrong,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAnd he ran downstairs and shouted up, \u2018Call 911, the car\u2019s on fire!\u2019\u201d Video from the home\u2019s doorbell camera,\u00a0which the family provided to CNN,\u00a0shows smoke before the fire erupts and then\u00a0engulfs the car. The cause of the fire in the Murano remains unknown. The fire is\u00a0under investigation\u00a0by Nissan. The National Highway Traffic Administration is gathering information\u00a0on the fire, as well. \u201cThe safety and security of our customers is our primary concern,\u201d a Nissan spokesperson said in a statement in response to an email asking about the fire. \u201cWe have opened an investigation into this incident.\u201d The\u00a0Hills\u2019 Murano was recalled by Nissan\u00a0in 2016 and 2019, to fix a problem that could allow brake fluid to leak and start a fire, even while the vehicle is parked. At the time, owners were warned to park their vehicles outside and away from buildings until the issue was repaired because of fire risks. A search on NHTSA\u2019s website indicated there was an outstanding unrepaired recall on the Hills\u2019 Murano. The couple said a local fire investigator suggested the unrepaired recall could have caused the fire. But the Hills remember getting the work done and provided CNN with a photograph of the receipt from a local Nissan dealership that showed the repair was made. CNN has not confirmed whether the receipt is authentic. The Hills said that because the recall work had been done, the possibility of a fire wasn\u2019t something that crossed their minds. Philip Hill had been fixing the garage, so the couple\u2019s two cars were parked in the driveway. Otherwise, the Murano would have been parked inside the garage adjoining the house. \u201cAs you can see from the video, that vehicle is so close to the house,\u201d Philip Hill told CNN. \u201cMinutes later, the house could have gone up.\u201d As it was, the garage door melted from the flames, they said. The Hills credit a neighbor\u2019s dog with saving them and their three children. The neighbor was able to call 911 before the Hills, after being alerted by her dog. The intense flames from the burning Nissan also damaged the side of the family\u2019s other car, a 2012 Mercedes C-class, leaving it unusable. Initially, the Hills were concerned they might have been victims of vandalism. But\u00a0they said\u00a0the video footage from their Nest doorbell camera\u00a0clearly\u00a0showed the vehicle spontaneously combusting. Nissan took possession of the Murano on Wednesday to study it more closely, the Hills said. As surprising as the Hills\u2019 situation may seem, vehicle fires are not uncommon. In 2022, an estimated 188,500 car and truck fires blazed in the United States, an average of more than 500 a day, according to the National Fire Protection Association. Vehicle fires caused 610 civilian deaths that year, according the NFPA.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/business/nissan-suv-driveway-explosion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

Millions of Americans have taken to the skies, hit the road, fired up the barbecue grill and jumped into the pool this weekend to celebrate the start of summer 2024. Analysts are expecting the Memorial Day weekend to usher in yet another summer of strong consumer spending on travel and other leisure activities. The season is already off to a solid start: The Transportation Security Administration said that Thursday was its second-busiest day at airports in history, adding that five of its 10 busiest days ever were this month. AAA projected earlier this month that 43.8 million Americans are driving at least 50 miles this weekend, up 4% from last year\u2019s total and close to the all-time record of 44 million during the 2005 Memorial Day weekend. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen Memorial Day weekend travel numbers like these in almost 20 years,\u201d Paula Twidale, senior vice president at AAA Travel, said in a release. Royal Caribbean\u2019s first-quarter earnings results topped expectations, thanks to strong bookings and robust onboard spending. Company executives said in a earnings call that they\u2019re optimistic for the remainder of the year. If this momentum persists throughout the summer, that would mean solid revenue for leisure businesses such as Royal Caribbean, hotels, restaurants and theme parks, also providing an economic boost to cities with a big tourism scene. A Bank of America Institute analysis released last week expects that to be the case. In a virtual presentation to reporters, the bank\u2019s analysts said the outlook for leisure spending this summer looks promising, based on trends reflected in the bank\u2019s card data, results from a survey of 2,010 respondents and other resources from across the bank. Spending this summer will likely be a little softer than last year\u2019s, they said, but still strong. \u201cThe strength of the data already speaks to it being a solid summer,\u201d David Tinsley, senior economist at the Bank of America Institute, said during the presentation. The bank\u2019s consumer travel survey showed that 72% of people said they\u2019re planning to travel, with 36% saying they\u2019ve already planned their trip. It showed that more younger Americans are planning to take an international trip than older generations, while also planning for longer trips and to spend more. From January through April, spending using a Bank of America card per household was the highest for Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, Colombia and Costa Rica. In April, the share of total in-person international spending through Bank of America was the highest for Europe (32%), followed by Canada and Mexico (23%), then the Caribbean (13%). Domestically, California and Florida have seen some momentum recently when it comes to spending at restaurants. In the first four months of the year, spending rose more than 5% in California from the same period a year ago, while it was mostly flat in Florida. But compared to 2019, restaurant spending in California and Florida is up roughly 15% in each state. Even among respondents making less than $75,000 a year, more than 60% said they\u2019re planning to travel this summer. That figure is north of 80% for respondents making more than $150,000 a year. But the good times may not last forever. Americans have come increasingly under pressure with household debt continuing to climb and delinquencies rising, according to New York Fed data. \u201cIn the first quarter of 2024, credit card and auto loan transition rates into serious delinquency continued to rise across all age groups,\u201d Joelle Scally, regional economic principal within the Household and Public Policy Research Division at the New York Fed, said in a statement. Inflation is also still taking a bite out of people\u2019s budgets and interest rates remain perched at a two-decade high. Economists aren\u2019t expecting a recession this year, but many are estimating the economy will slow over the next 12 months: The latest figures on employment came in weaker than expected. For some, this year\u2019s summer splurge could well be the last hurrah. The dog who inspired Dogecoin has died Kabosu, the dog who launched a thousand \u201cdoge\u201d memes, has died, her owner announced Friday. The Japanese Shiba Inu \u201cfell into a deep sleep\u201d on Friday morning at 18 years of age, Atsuko Sato wrote in a\u00a0blogpost. \u201cOutside the window, birds were singing on a beautiful morning. As I was touching her, she gently passed away,\u201d wrote Sato, a kindergarten teacher in the Japanese city of Sakura. \u201cI think she was the happiest dog in the world.\u201d Kabosu became one of the most recognizable animals on the internet back in 2010 when a photo of her posing with folded paws and a quizzical expression spread across forums such as Reddit. That sparked a proliferation of \u201cdoge\u201d memes, based on an intentional misspelling of the word \u201cdog,\u201d with internet users photoshopping Kabosu\u2019s face onto pastries, landmarks and other animals. The popularity of \u201cdoge\u201d memes was cemented in December 2013, when Kabosu became the face of alternative cryptocurrency dogecoin \u2014 a tongue-in-cheek response to bitcoin that reflected the internet\u2019s love of animal memes.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_business_why-do-we-eat-popcorn-at-the-movies", "text": "Even before the house lights dim, the cinema experience is well under way, with one concession-stand food holding top billing. Its roasty, buttery aroma fills the lobby, a smell that\u2019s both unmistakable and, often, core memory-inducing. A kernel smacks the side of a stainless steel kettle, a hint of the percussive symphony to come. As a white, fluffy wave boils up, the contents are scooped into a tub and drizzled \u2014 if you are lucky \u2014 with real melted butter. And as you slide into a cushioned seat, the delicate puffs give way to a soft crunch. It\u2019s Memorial Day weekend, the traditional start to the summer blockbuster movie season, and for 90-plus years and through generation after generation, the salty and buttery treat\u2019s symbiotic relationship with the cinema has remained. \u201cPopcorn and the movies are as inextricably linked as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, peanut butter and chocolate; and, as such, represent perhaps one of the greatest duos in modern history,\u201d Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore, told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more perfect combination and one that has become part of the culture in such a profound and ubiquitous way.\u201d The nation\u2019s largest movie chain, AMC Theaters, pops enough popcorn to fill 222 Olympic-sized swimming pools every year, according to the company. But the perfect (and very profitable) pairing of today wasn\u2019t always the case: For many years, movie theaters wanted nothing to do with the snack. A match made in oil and butter There\u2019s plenty of lore packed in to popcorn\u2019s origin story and a fair bit of drama involved in its \u201cshotgun wedding\u201d with the movies, according to Andrew F. Smith\u2019s \u201cPopped Culture: A Social History of Popcorn in America.\u201d Smith, in cataloging popcorn\u2019s rise, debunked most of the long-ingrained fables behind the snack. It was not a \u201cfirst Thanksgiving\u201d side dish but rather landed in New England in the early half of the 19th century, likely brought there by American sailors returning from South America. Popping corn became a popular recreational activity by the 1840s, after \u201cwire-on-the-fire\u201d poppers and popping apparatuses were invented. In the following decades, popcorn vendors proliferated at fairs, circuses and on city streets. More commercial operations emerged, Cracker Jack became a ballpark staple and a slow courtship with the movie exhibition business began. That business, saved by the advent of the \u201ctalkie,\u201d blossomed during the early 20th century. By 1930, a stunning 90 million people were going to the movies on a weekly basis, Smith wrote. The crowd appeared ripe for the picking to popcorn salesmen, but theater owners balked. \u201cTo some owners, vending all concessions was an unnecessary nuisance or \u2018beneath their dignity,\u2019\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cIn the rowdy, burlesque days, hawkers went through the aisles with baskets selling Cracker Jack and popcorn. Much of the popcorn was tossed in the air or strewn on the floors.\u201d In cinemas, the scattered popcorn bits would muck up the valuable carpet that was meant to emulate the grand theater lobbies. But cinema owners changed their tune, and popcorn\u2019s boom came during one of the unlikeliest of economic periods: The Great Depression. \u201cAt five or 10 cents a bag, popcorn was an affordable luxury for most Americans,\u201d Smith wrote. The popcorn-making initially took place outside of the theaters, where operators leased space to vendors as it was seen as too costly to outfit the buildings with vents. But once competitors started popping up and tales of \u201cpopcorn wealth\u201d spread like wildfire, the concession was brought in-house. \u201cPopcorn sold so well because of its aroma \u2014 the same smell that some theater owners had reportedly despised earlier,\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cThe aroma was maximized during the popping process. As soon as the machines were placed in the lobbies, business picked up.\u201d A national pastime On a recent Sunday morning here in South Minneapolis, a decades-long father-son tradition continued at the Riverview Theater, a single-screen cinema nestled among century-old bungalows. Ever since John Aitkin, 44, was a kid, he and his father, John Sr., have been catching movies at the Riverview. As they awaited the start of \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes,\u201d they were accompanied by other longstanding members of the monthly custom: a bucket of popcorn and a couple of soda pops. \u201c(Popcorn\u2019s) a pastime,\u201d the younger Aitkin said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m eating it, it makes everything feel OK. It\u2019s just \u2018popcorn and a movie,\u2019 and you can disappear from the anxiety of daily living.\u201d It\u2019s also an affordable escape. The medium bucket ran Aitkin a cool $2.50, half the price of his ticket that day. (This is the exception: In some regions, popcorn can easily run three or four times that.) The Riverview popcorn\u2019s fame and popularity extends beyond the walls of the 75-year-old building. For years, the neighborhood cinema has sold it to-go, an offering that helped the theater navigate 2020, said Loren Williams, the Riverview\u2019s owner. \u201cWhen the pandemic came, that was all we had,\u201d he told CNN of the community support. The post-pandemic picture After the pandemic reopenings, people were not only buying premium tickets, but also spending more on concessions, said Alicia Reese, an analyst who covers the media and entertainment industry for Wedbush. \u201cWe thought that there was just pent-up demand for going out and [people] treating themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this trend has persisted. It has not declined, and it\u2019s still growing.\u201d That\u2019s good news for theater operators at a time when attendance hasn\u2019t yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. That\u2019s because, at their heart, cinemas are mostly food service and real estate operations, said Ricard Gil, an associate professor who specializes in organizational economics at Queen\u2019s University in Canada. Generally, the ticket revenue is split 50-50 between the theater operators and the movie studios, said Gil, who previously researched why movie theater concessions come at steep prices. For the exhibitors, that half (or, oftentimes, less) isn\u2019t enough to recoup all the other costs. Concessions account for about one-third of overall domestic sales at the largest US chains of AMC and Cinemark, Wedbush\u2019s Reese said. \u201cOver 80% of that revenue is going to profit, which is substantial and unlike most other businesses,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reason for that is that most of the concession sales are popcorn, where the cost is quite low.\u201d Droids and sandworms filled with popcorn In 2023, AMC Theatres\u2019 food and beverage business totaled $1.67 billion in revenue, financial filings show. (By comparison, that\u2019s more than the annual revenue of restaurant chains like BJ\u2019s, Waffle House and Red Robin). \u201cThe sun rises and sets on our concession business,\u201d Nels Storm, AMC Theatres\u2019 vice president of food and beverage product strategy, said in an interview. And popcorn, he said, remains the \u201cvenerable force\u201d behind that business. But, given external threats to the industry, such as at-home entertainment and more options competing for consumers\u2019 almighty dollar, popcorn has to evolve with the times. For AMC, that\u2019s included launching a line of microwave and ready-to-eat popcorn for sale at retailers like Walmart and Kroger, offering unique or movie-themed flavors and leaning heavily into merchandising. Popular movies often bring collectible cups and popcorn buckets, or, in industry-speak, Collectible Concession Vehicles (CCVs). At AMC, these have included R2-D2 popcorn buckets; Ghostbusters\u2019 Ecto 1; the infamous Dune: Part Two sandworm; and, coming in June, a \u201cGarfield\u201d CCV that includes a plush doll \u2014 a fitting throwback to the days when stuffed versions of the lasagna-loving tabby were suctioned-cupped to car windows. For years, cinemas have broadened their concessions, with some taking it to the next level of dine-in theaters. Alamo Drafthouse, which got its start in 1997, offers a full menu and bar (complete with servers). Despite the full menu, popcorn remains the most frequently purchased food item, said Heather Morgan, Alamo\u2019s chief of staff and strategy. Alamo is quick to experiment with its popcorn and other concessions by tying them in to various theme nights, she said, noting that the chain created a berbere-spiced popcorn for \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d \u201cWe can see an uptick in sales, because people want to try the new and different flavors,\u201d she said. Chocolate popcorn and homegrown flavors Those unique takes extend to smaller theaters, as well. In Brooklyn, New York, Nitehawk Cinema is known for its truffle popcorn.  In Iowa City, Iowa, the nonprofit FilmScene cinema uses a recipe handed down from the University of Iowa\u2019s student cinema group. \u201cWe don\u2019t offer butter, and we promise you don\u2019t need it,\u201d Andrew Sherburne, FilmScene\u2019s executive director and co-founder, wrote via email to CNN. In Seattle, Emerald City film-lovers rejoiced when the iconic Cinerama theater was resurrected after a pandemic closure and its famed chocolate popcorn returned. At Cinelounge Cinemas in California, founder Christian Meoli crafted a line of eight artisan popcorns to be sold onsite, online and in stores. The movie-themed offerings \u2014 featuring flavors such as cinnamon churro, bourbon caramel and rosemary \u2014 also serve as a vehicle to spur investment in the film community: The proceeds help fund grants, screenings and equipment for aspiring filmmakers, he said. The cinema business will continue to evolve, but one thing will remain constant, said Gil of Queen\u2019s University. \u201cThe only economics of movie theaters that has changed is the romanticism of showing movies has gone away a little bit, and movie theater companies have realized that they are real estate companies, and they have capacity, and they need to fill the capacity, and they\u2019ll do whatever (it takes) to actually do that,\u201d Gil said. \u201cTheaters will stop playing movies before they will actually stop selling popcorn.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/business/why-do-we-eat-popcorn-at-the-movies/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_investing_graceland-foreclosure-hearing", "text": "Graceland can stay in the hands of Elvis Presley\u2019s family for the time being, after a Tennessee court chancellor ruled Wednesday that a mysterious company trying to sell it likely committed fraud. Chancellor JoeDae Jenkins said that a planned foreclosure sale of Graceland, Elvis Presley\u2019s historic Memphis home, would be postponed at least until a future hearing determines who maintains rightful ownership of the estate. A bizarre series of events set the late singer\u2019s granddaughter against a mysterious company that claimed Elvis\u2019 daughter gave it Graceland\u2019s deed. A hearing in the Shelby County, Tennessee, Chancery Court determined that Thursday\u2019s planned foreclosure auction of Graceland would irreparably harm Elvis\u2019 granddaughter, Danielle Riley Keough, who sued to block the sale. Keough took ownership of the estate and popular tourist attraction after her mother and Elvis\u2019 daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, died in January 2023. \u201cThe estate is considered unique under Tennessee law, and in being unique the loss of the real estate will be considered irreparable harm,\u201d Jenkins said. Jenkins also said there was evidence that a company trying to foreclose on Graceland had forged documents that it claimed gave it the right to sell the property. After the hearing, a person who said he represented the company trying to foreclose said it would drop its claim. In a statement, Graceland said the property will continue to operate. \u201cAs the court has now made clear, there was no validity to the claims,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThere will be no foreclosure.\u00a0\u00a0Graceland will continue to operate as it has for the past 42 years, ensuring that Elvis fans from around the world can continue to have a best in class experience when visiting his iconic home.\u201d Who holds the rights to Graceland? A company called Naussany Investments & Private Lending LLC had claimed that Lisa Marie Presley failed to pay back a $3.8 million loan it had given her \u2013 and Naussany said Presley had put up Graceland as collateral against the loan. Seeking repayment, it had scheduled an auction of the estate. This was no typical foreclosure sale. Keough filed a lawsuit earlier this month, claiming there was no such loan. She also claims\u00a0Naussany isn\u2019t even a real company. \u201cThese documents are fraudulent,\u201d Keough\u2019s lawsuit alleges. \u201cLisa Marie Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments.\u201d The lawsuit alleges Naussany Investments & Private Lending LLC \u201cappears to be a false entity created for the purpose of defrauding.\u201d Although Naussany provided what appears to be a 2018 notarized promissory note signed by Lisa Marie Presley to put up Graceland as collateral, Keough\u2019s lawsuit said that was a forgery. In a signed affidavit, the notary public denied ever notarizing anything that Lisa Marie Presley had signed. Chancellor Jenkins said that affidavit was sufficient evidence to delay the foreclosure until a hearing can determine the facts. But Jenkins also said the evidence suggested Keough was telling the truth. \u201cIt appears you\u2019ll be successful on the merits \u2026 provided you prove at the ultimate hearing fraud alleged by your client and the notary,\u201d Jenkins said Wednesday. Naussany said it is not going to proceed with its claim and \u201cwill be withdrawing all claims with prejudice,\u201d according to a statement released\u00a0today\u00a0by a person\u00a0identified as a representative of\u00a0Naussany Investments & Private Lending LLC, the company accused of trying to fraudulently foreclose on the historic property. \u201cDue to the Deed of Trust not being recorded and the loan being obtained in different state, legal action would have to be filed in multiple states and Naussany Investments & Private Lending will not acquire to proceed,\u201d the company said.. \u201cThat comes from consultation of the lawyers for the company. There was no harm meant on Ms. Keough for her mothers LMP mis habits and mis managing of money.\u201d Elvis Presley Enterprises, the company that manages Presley\u2019s estate, concurred that Naussany\u2019s claim was illegitimate. \u201cElvis Presley Enterprises can confirm that these claims are fraudulent,\u201d the company said. \u201cThere is no foreclosure sale. Simply put, the counter lawsuit has been filed is to stop the fraud.\u201d A judge last week granted a temporary restraining order, preventing Naussany from selling Graceland. Jenkins extended that order Wednesday. An estate in dispute Following Lisa Marie Presley\u2019s death, Keogh and her grandmother, Priscilla Presley, fought over the rights to her estate \u2013 including Graceland. Ultimately, Keough and Presley settled, and Keough became Graceland\u2019s sole owner. In 2004, Lisa Marie Presley sold 85% of Elvis Presley Enterprises\u2019 assets in a\u00a0deal reportedly worth more than $100 million. But she maintained complete ownership of the\u00a0Graceland mansion and Elvis\u2019 personal items housed in what is now the Graceland museum, according to the Graceland website. Graceland is one of the South\u2019s biggest tourist draws, visited by hundreds of thousands of people each year, Graceland says on its website. Lisa Marie Presley annually earned seven figures from it, based on a court filing in her 2022 divorce. Who is Riley Keough? Keough was born to parents Lisa Marie Presley and musician Danny Keough in 1989. She is a well-known actor, appearing in \u201cMad Max Fury Road\u201d and other Hollywood hits. She also appears in Hulu\u2019s \u201cUnder the Bridge.\u201d First credited as an actor in the movie the Runaways in 2010, Keough has racked up a number of acting roles. She recently starred in \u201cDaisy Jones & The Six,\u201d where she played a troubled musician in a band about to make it big. In a piece for Vanity Fair, Keough revealed she has a daughter, Tupelo Storm Smith-Petersen, who was born via surrogate in August 2022. Elvis was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, in 1935, but Keough said the name is a tribute to her late brother, Benjamin Storm Keough, who died in 2020 at the age of 27.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/investing/graceland-foreclosure-hearing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

Even after years of inflation, geopolitical chaos and recession in Europe, the US economy remains robust and resilient. The reason for that is mostly the American consumer, with spending accounting for about 70% of gross domestic product. But some observers now worry that the economy represents a tale of two Americas. Some businesses and consumers continue to thrive, while others are falling by the wayside. What\u2019s happening: Economic activity in the US remains relatively strong, but there are some signs that the momentum is beginning to cool. Unemployment rose to 3.9% last month, lower-income consumers are spending less and businesses are limiting employee hours and pay. Consumer growth in general is beginning to moderate, but gently. \u201cThat may mask more pronounced financial difficulties for the bottom three income quintiles facing the strenuous combination of higher prices, larger interest burdens and softening job prospects,\u201d said EY chief economist Gregory Daco in a note on Tuesday. While consumer balance sheets are still holding strong in aggregate \u2014 the US has added $40 trillion in wealth since the start of 2020, and Americans haven\u2019t stopped spending \u2014not every balance sheet looks the same. \u201cThe economy is bifurcated into the haves and have-nots, as middle class Americans are struggling with rising prices and lagging wage growth,\u201d said Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer at Regan Capital in a statement. This earnings season exemplifies that growing divide. McDonald\u2019s (MCD) reported that people of all income levels are seeking value. Starbucks (SBUX) said that customers are becoming more particular about where they spend their money. Mondelez (MDLZ) executives discussed an increase in price sensitivity in their earnings call. A recent survey by Santander Bank of its customers found that while inflation fears have largely subsided, middle-income Americans are pessimistic about the economy. About 60% believe the US will enter a recession in the next 12 months, and 62% are making significant cuts to their household spending, the bank found. \u201cIt\u2019s well known that the lowest income consumer is really struggling with inflation, but from a purely economic standpoint, it is the higher quintiles of earners that do the most spending,\u201d Nanette Abuhoff Jacobson, global investment strategist at Hartford Funds, told my colleague Bryan Mena. Why it matters: There are many shapes to a recession. Some economists have speculated that the US has been in a so-called \u201crolling recession\u201d where only certain sectors of the economy are impacted. But there are also recessions that mostly hurt lower-income Americans. A K-shaped recession is what happens when separate communities are hit by and recover from economic downturns at varying rates. Some parts of society may experience renewed growth while others continue to lag behind. While the recovery from the 2020 recession can be described as V-shaped, many point out that it was actually two-pronged. Low-income Black and Hispanic families saw the fastest depletion of their savings during the pandemic, for example. Many who worked in white-collar jobs recovered quickly as the government handed out stimulus payments and as stocks and home prices appreciated. Those without savings and who worked service jobs continued to suffer. Employees receiving the lowest wages were the most likely to lose their jobs in nearly every sector of the economy between 2020 and 2021, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Those Americans could still be suffering, but their stories are obscured by data that paints a broad picture of a resilient economy. What\u2019s next: That bifurcated economy, wrote Daco, will lead some businesses to succeed while others struggle. It \u201cwill also lead to conflicting inflation signals with some sectors experiencing outright deflation and others experiencing persistently elevated inflation,\u201d he said. That could make it a lot more difficult for Federal Reserve officials to decide whether to lower interest rates or keep them steady during their next few policy meetings. There\u2019s a danger that if monetary policy is too strict, it could quickly make financial conditions tougher, said Daco. \u201cThis, along with growing concerns about the country\u2019s financial direction, might cause businesses and consumers to pull back on spending and investment,\u201d he said. Jamie Dimon could step down sooner than expected. Here\u2019s who could run the country\u2019s biggest bank JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has bumped up his retirement plans, the longtime head of America\u2019s largest bank said Monday. Dimon is one of the most well-known and closely listened to CEOs in the world. Over the course of his tenure at JPMorgan Chase, he\u2019s become somewhat synonymous with the largest US bank by assets. But Dimon can\u2019t lead forever, and at 68 years old, the\u00a0question of succession\u00a0has grown more important. The timetable for stepping down \u2014 which he has long joked was \u201cfive years away\u201d any time the question was put to him \u2014 is \u201cnot five years anymore,\u201d Dimon said at the bank\u2019s investor conference this week. Dimon, who has led the bank since 2006, said that while \u201cI still have the energy I\u2019ve always had, I think when I can\u2019t put on the jersey \u2026 I should leave.\u201d Succession plans at the bank, he said, are \u201cwell on the way.\u201d Shares of the company\u2019s stock sold off after Dimon\u2019s announcement, closing 4.3% lower. \u201cWe believe that it will take time for the street to gain comfort with the next CEO and [Monday\u2019s] stock reaction was evidence of that,\u201d wrote Bank of America analysts in a note on Tuesday.\u00a0\u201cDimon\u00a0has delivered unparalleled shareholder returns during his tenure as CEO while navigating the bank through some major macro-economic crises.\u201d The Bank of America analysts forecast that Dimon will step down in late 2025 or 2026, but the specifics of JPMorgan\u2019s succession plans have been the subject of speculation on Wall Street for many years. Earlier this year, some of the bank\u2019s top executives were moved into new roles in order to expand their experience. The bank appointed Marianne Lake as the sole CEO of the consumer division, an area previously run by both Lake and Jennifer Piepszak. Piepszak, meanwhile, now leads the company\u2019s newly combined commercial and investment bank with her co-CEO Troy Rohrbaugh. Rohrbaugh is the former head of trading and securities services for the bank. Other potential successors include Mary Erdoes, CEO of asset and wealth management; chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum and president and chief operating officer Daniel Pinto. In 2020, Dimon experienced an \u201cacute aortic dissection\u201d \u2014 a tear in the inner lining of the aorta blood vessel \u2014 requiring surgery. Then co-COOs Gordon Smith and Daniel Pinto\u00a0led the company in his absence. Smith retired from the bank in January 2022. Microsoft thinks it has found a way to make PCs relevant again Microsoft\u00a0jumped headfirst into building artificial intelligence directly into its Windows operating system on Monday, announcing new AI computers that could help ramp up flagging PC sales. The\u00a0developments push the company closer to its long-time goal\u00a0to \u201cbuild computers that understand us versus us having to understand computers,\u201d\u00a0CEO Satya Nadella told the audience\u00a0at the company\u2019s annual developer conference\u00a0at its Redmond, Washington headquarters. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re really close to that real breakthrough,\u201d he added. The computers, which are packed with processors that power advanced AI tools, come\u00a0as PC sales have stalled for years. The company hopes the new machines\u00a0will\u00a0boost sales and revive excitement, particularly\u00a0as\u00a0AI is expected to become increasingly part of everyday life.

{"id": "2024_05_27_tech_china-semiconductor-investment-fund-intl-hnk", "text": "China is doubling down on its plan to\u00a0dominate advanced technologies of the future by setting up its largest-ever semiconductor state investment fund, according to information posted by a government-run agency. Worth $47.5 billion, the fund is being created as the US imposes sweeping restrictions on the export of American chips and chip technology in a bid to throttle Beijing\u2019s ambitions. With investments from six of the country\u2019s largest state-owned banks, including ICBC and China Construction Bank, the fund underscores Chinese leader\u00a0Xi Jinping\u2019s push to bolster China\u2019s position as a tech superpower. With its\u00a0Made in China 2025 road map, Beijing has set a target for China to become a global leader in a wide range of industries, including artificial intelligence (AI), 5G wireless, and quantum computing. The latest investment vehicle is the third phase of the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund. The \u201cBig Fund,\u201d as it is known, was officially established in Beijing on Friday, according to the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System. The first phase of the fund was set up in 2014 with 138.7 billion yuan ($19.2 billion). The second phase was established five years later, with a registered capital of 204.1 billion yuan ($28.2 billion). The investments aim to bring the country\u2019s semiconductor industry up to international standards by 2030 and will pump money primarily into chip manufacturing, design, equipment and materials, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said when launching the first phase in 2014. Roadblocks ahead? The \u201cBig Fund\u201d has been hit by corruption scandals in recent years. In 2022, the country\u2019s anti-graft watchdog launched a crackdown on the semiconductor industry, investigating some of China\u2019s top figures in state-owned chip companies. Lu Jun, former chief executive of Sino IC Capital, which managed the \u201cBig Fund,\u201d was probed and indicted on bribery charges in March, according to a statement by the country\u2019s top prosecutor. These scandals aren\u2019t the only roadblocks that could severely undermined Xi\u2019s ambitions to get China to achieve tech self-reliance. In October 2022, the US unveiled a sweeping set of export controls that ban Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and chip-making equipment without a license.\u00a0The Biden administration has also pressed its allies, including Netherlands and Japan, to enact their own restrictions. Beijing hit back last year by imposing export controls on two strategic raw materials that are critical to the global chipmaking industry. The new chip fund is not only a defensive move to counter Western sanctions, but also part of Xi\u2019s long-held ambitions to make China a global leader in technology. Last year, China\u2019s Huawei shocked industry experts by introducing a new smartphone powered by a 7-nanometer processor made by China\u2019s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). At the time of the Huawei phone launch, analysts could not understand how the company would have the technology to make such a chip following sweeping efforts by the United States to restrict China\u2019s access to foreign technology. In a meeting with the Dutch Prime Minister\u00a0Mark Rutte in March, Xi said that \u201cno force can stop China\u2019s scientific and technological development.\u201d The Netherlands is home to ASML, the world\u2019s sole manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography machines needed to make advanced semiconductors. The company said in January that it had been\u00a0prohibited\u00a0by the Dutch government from shipping some of its lithography machines to China.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/tech/china-semiconductor-investment-fund-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

That\u2019s the result of a \u201cconvergence of a few important factors,\u201d according to Bob Lynch, CEO of SponsorUnited, including rising TV ratings for the Tennis Channel and major tournaments, the docuseries \u201cBreak Point\u201d that had a two-season run on Netflix plus the growth of tennis players\u2019 social media accounts. Tennis is one the rare sports that plays nearly year-round with weekly tournaments across the world, so it \u201cattracts a diverse, global and localized fan base, which gives brands the ability to target very specific audiences for specific reasons,\u201d Lynch told CNN. Want to promote Swiss tourism around the world? The country tapped its greatest tennis export Roger Federer to star in a campaign for just that, with one viral ad starring Anne Hathaway that garnered more than 100 million views on YouTube. Or want to advertise to an affluent audience? That explains all the banking logos surrounding the courts at Roland Garros in Paris. Tennis is also going through a change of guard, especially on the men\u2019s side with Rafael Nadal likely playing his final season and Novak Djokovic, who is still the world\u2019s no. 1 men\u2019s player, lately struggling. Popular players on the woman\u2019s tour such as the Williams sisters have either retired, struggled with injuries or have taken a maternity leave such as former no. 1 Naomi Osaka. That\u2019s prompted an opening for many players, especially younger ones, including 2023 Wimbledon winner Carlos Alcaraz, who is just 21 years old, and Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, the 22-year-old from Poland who has already won four grand slam titles, to become global superstars. \u201cDigitally native and content savvy younger players like Coco Gauff are becoming more prominent,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cFans have more access to tennis athletes and their lives, interests and journeys than ever before due to the increased social exposure they receive, which allows them to become more influential to fans and brands alike.\u201d A scroll through Gauff\u2019s Instagram page, where the 2023 US Open women\u2019s final winner has nearly 2 million followers, shows her various sponsors mixed with photos from her personal life. Posts on her feed range from Barilla (the pasta maker signed her in 2019 to include its logo on her clothing), to speaking about how technology helps her practice in a Microsoft ad. How players cash in Another brand featured heavily on Gauff\u2019s Instagram is New Balance, her official on-court outfitter that signed her when she was just 14 years old, which has since expanded to include a lineup of shoes that the 20-year-old helps design. When Gauff won her first Grand Slam title last year, not only was she wearing a New Balance outfit designed for the US Open, but after winning, she donned a \u201cCall Me Coco Champion\u201d T-shirt that sold out within a few hours. Although she\u2019s the brand\u2019s biggest player, she\u2019s also part of a select few athletes that the privately owned apparel maker has deals with, trailing bigger outfitters such as Nike and Adidas. \u201cWe say no a lot,\u201d admits Evan Zeder, director of global sports marketing for New Balance\u2019s tennis and baseball units. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking to just sign a bunch of athletes to have a bunch of athletes.\u201d Its players, which also includes no. 14 men\u2019s player Tommy Paul, get various forms of payment including retainers and bonuses from New Balance and clothes and footwear to wear on and off the court. Tennis is different because the athlete is wearing the brand head to toe and is the center of attention since it\u2019s largely a solo sport. Choosing a tennis player to sponsor takes trust on both sides, with New Balance having to prove that its clothes and shoes perform \u201con the highest levels of the sport\u201d and avoid a public relations nightmare currently happening in baseball, but it\u2019s \u201cultimately waiting for the right opportunities for the brand,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe opportunity for us to story tell with the athletes is more unique than any other sport out there because they\u2019re not wearing a team or jersey, they\u2019re wearing New Balance,\u201d he said. Fashion on the forefront While New Balance is a relatively new clothier to enter the sport, others have been involved for decades. Lacoste, the French luxury brand, was born with tennis in mind since its start in 1933. After all, founder Ren\u00e9 Lacoste created the \u201cpolo shirt\u201d that was made for tennis. \u201cLacoste\u00a0undoubtedly benefits from the greatest legitimacy in this universe thanks to its sporting roots, particularly in tennis,\u201d said Lacoste\u2019s Deputy CEO Catherine Spindler. The crocodile-adorned brand has two of the biggest names in tennis who faced off against each other in the 2023 US Open men\u2019s final: Djokovic and Daniil Medvedev, with the former easily winning. Lacoste\u2019s polo shirts have become a major part of the \u201ctennis aesthetic,\u201d or the luxury athleticism #tenniscore trending on social media. That\u2019s perhaps not a surprise to Spindler because the sport \u201chas always been associated with elegance, including from a sartorial point of view.\u201d \u201cRecently, the influence of tennis on fashion has strengthened even further, and many are adopting the codes of this sport,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cPieces from the tennis universe are highly praised and serve as sources of inspiration for everyone.\u201d Zendaya recently wore a custom-made Lacoste silhouette ensemble for her \u201cChallengers\u201d press stop in Australia, which is \u201cfurther proof of the inspiration generated by tennis,\u201d Spindler said. Big business for booze Tennis has not only raised the profile for clothing, but it\u2019s a magnet for premium spirit brands too. The Australian Open serves up the Aperol Spritz. Roland Garros in Paris, which starts Sunday, has its Mo\u00ebt & Chandon champagne and no visit to Wimbledon, near London, is complete without a Pimm\u2019s. However, arguably the most popular cocktail in tennis is at the US Open: the Honey Deuce. The $22 drink mixes Grey Goose vodka, lemonade and Chambord and is topped with a honeydew melon ball. In 2023, a record-breaking 450,000 of these drinks were sold. Alcohol brands trying to crack the US market see the growing popularity of tennis as an opportunity to introduce themselves to drinkers. Take Maestro Dobel, a tequila brand sold in the US since 2008 but overshadowed by its celebrity-backed competitors. Dobel became the US Open\u2019s official tequila sponsor last year, bringing alongs its Ace Paloma cocktail that it sells at other tennis tournaments it sponsors. But the brand\u2019s attraction to tennis \u201cwasn\u2019t something that happened overnight,\u201d said Lander Otegui, the chief marketing officer for Proximo, noting that the brand has sponsored tournaments in Mexico for more than a decade. Dobel, in recent years, expanded north to become sponsors of elite-level tournaments in Miami, Indian Wells and Cincinnati \u2014 all places where Otegui said Dobel sees an \u201cuptick\u201d in sales following the tournament. The fans that tennis attracts are \u201cpretty wide\u201d in regards to ages but the affluent audience that frequent the events \u201cgoes hand-and-hand with the brand,\u201d Otegui said. Otegui declined to reveal specific financial numbers on sponsoring a tournament, but said it\u2019s a \u201cmulti-million dollar investment\u201d that involves paying a hefty fee and additional money for displays and, at the US Open, a starry suite. Last year, it had a suite at Arthur Ashe Stadium, the US Open\u2019s biggest court, where it attracted A-list stars like Charlize Theron and Katie Holmes, which in return, gave the brand even more publicity. \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible time for tennis in the last few years, and with record attendance\u00a0for pretty much every event in the US and globally,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sport is in a really good place and it\u2019s also helped us solidify\u00a0our presence in it.\u201d As for the future, growth won\u2019t fault if the USTA has its way: The organization wants to grow the number of people playing to 35 million, or 10% of the US population, within the next decade.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/business/tennis-popularity-zendaya-challengers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_business_summer-2024-box-office-earnings-forecast", "text": "The summer box office is off to a lukewarm start. Last\u00a0summer, blockbusters \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d\u00a0combined added nearly a billion dollars to the domestic box office, according to Comscore data. But this year, studios are betting on a large slate of mid-range sequels and prequels, as well as family-focused animated films to fill the Barbenheimer-shaped hole, including \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga,\u201d \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2.\u201d Coupled with production delays \u2014 the aftershocks of the multi-month-long Writers Guild and SAG-AFTRA strikes that are still reverberating across studios \u2014 the season that has historically drawn the biggest movie theater audiences is off to a rocky start, potentially hurting the yearly box office totals for 2024. \u201cSummer is the most important moviegoing season of the year, accounting on average for nearly 40% of the total domestic annual revenue, so as goes the summer so goes the year,\u201d Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, told CNN. \u201cBarring some major overperformances, this summer looks like it\u2019ll be down 20% to 25% in box office grosses between May and August from last year,\u201d said analyst Shawn Robbins, founder and owner of Box Office Theory. The elusive $100-million opening weekend Until 2020, the period between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day Monday could be counted on to bring in upwards of $4 billion in domestic revenue, according to Comscore data. Summer 2023 saw the first post-pandemic $4-billion summer. Propelled by the success of \u201cSound of Freedom,\u201d \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d and the record-breaking $155 million \u201cBarbie\u201d opening weekend, summer 2023 grossed $4.09 billion, a 19.2% jump from the year prior. \u201cBarbie\u201d was distributed by Warner Bros., which is owned by CNN\u2019s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery. An opening weekend north of $100 million is typically only seen in intellectual property-driven action films like Star Wars movies and superhero flicks, as well as animated family fare like \u201cThe Incredibles 2\u201d and \u201cFinding Dory.\u201d So far this year, no movie has crossed that threshold. \u201cSans a Marvel movie to provide a $100-million-plus opening weekend to get the momentum going, this summer will have to make up ground in June and July,\u201d said Dergarabedian, adding that this summer has so far been a \u201clate bloomer.\u201d Disney offerings could make or break the summer box office Two movies that analysts say could cross the $100 million threshold this summer are \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d both of which are distributed by Walt Disney Studios. The studio\u2019s first wide release of 2024 under its flagship \u201cDisney\u201d banner is set to be \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d an anomaly for the company and the movie business, according to Daniel Loria, editorial director at Box Office Pro, which collects sales and showtimes data from thousands of movie theaters across the United States. (Disney-owned 20th Century Entertainment released its first movie of the year, \u201cThe First Omen,\u201d in April.) \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other year where a studio as vital to this industry sits out the entire first half of the year,\u201d Loria told CNN, adding that this is in large part due to production delays and schedule shifts caused by months of back and forth between studios, the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, the actors\u2019 union. \u201cWe tend to overemphasize the effect of Hollywood\u2019s 2023 labor strikes at the box office, but it\u2019s hard not to cite it when you look at the number of releases to have hit theaters from major studios in the first half of the year.\u201d Disney has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Loria also emphasized that Disney\u2019s summer offerings, both from its Pixar and Marvel divisions, will be critical to how the 2024 box office performs overall. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d is forecast to open anywhere between $80 million and $100 million, according to Box Office Pro pre-sales data. Pixar\u2019s offerings in recent years have fallen flat; 2022\u2019s \u201cLightyear\u201d debuted at $50.5 million domestically, while 2023\u2019s \u201cElemental\u201d made $29.6 million its opening weekend. Meanwhile, \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d the only Marvel property release this summer, is expected to reinvigorate audience enthusiasm after \u201cThe Marvels\u201d disappointed last November with a $47 million opening weekend. Last week, ticket seller Fandango announced that \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d had broken the company\u2019s 2024 record for best first-day ticket presales, beating out \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d The film also had the best first day of ticket sales for an R-rated film in Fandango\u2019s 24-year history, the company told CNN. \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine has the potential to be the second movie (after 2021\u2019s \u201cSpiderman: No Way Home\u201d) to earn a $200 million opening weekend of the post-pandemic era,\u201d said Loria. \u201cWe are still two months out, but if pre-sales and awareness continue at this pace, we believe the film can open between $170 million and $210 million.\u201d \u201cDespicable Me 4\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2\u201d \u201clook particularly strong, and \u2018Deadpool & Wolverine\u2019 will hands down be the top film of the summer,\u201d said Dergarabedian. Studios still trying to find their footing Industry experts agree that the 2024 box office has been sluggish so far, but remain hopeful that the box office can rebound by the end of the year and beyond. \u201cBox office earnings have been down largely because of staggered gaps between widely appealing releases in the first half of the year,\u201d said Robbins. \u201cThat\u2019s been the status quo in the post-pandemic era for many reasons, mostly outside the control of theatrical exhibition. The industry had only a brief period between the impact of COVID production delays followed by the writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strikes last year.\u201d Robbins added that there\u2019s still time for strong titles in the second half of the year to fill the gap, including September\u2019s \u201cBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\u201d and \u201cTransformers One,\u201d and October\u2019s \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.\u201d \u201cMoviegoing habits have changed drastically since the\u00a0pandemic, but we continue to see significant enthusiasm when it comes to the theatrical experience,\u201d said Loria. \u201cThe data clearly shows that audiences can still support the studio tentpole model \u2014 but identifying the movies that will become those blockbuster hits continues to be as difficult to predict as ever before.\u201d Box Office Pro projects that the 2024 box office will gross $8.2 billion, about 10% lower than last year\u2019s $9 billion. The domestic earnings for 2023 were the highest since the pandemic, but still fell roughly $2 billion short of pre-pandemic yearly sales, according to Comscore.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/business/summer-2024-box-office-earnings-forecast/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

It felt like the world was potentially going to end, and I [said to my husband], \u2018dude, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done everything we want to do.\u2019\u201d She brought up the idea of moving to Portugal. As America\u2019s retirement crisis grows, so too does the dream of retiring abroad where cities are walkable, social services plentiful and the cost of living affordable: Gelato in the piazza, white sand and year-round sun, little villages tucked into ocean coves and cheap health care all sound pretty good. But while retirees might imagine spending their golden years full of pasta and palazzos, the realities of moving abroad are much less romantic. There\u2019s often more bureaucracy than bruschetta. Laura\u2019s husband, Chris, was initially skeptical about the move. He didn\u2019t think retiring abroad was feasible. Plus, they\u2019d be leaving behind their two sons and two grandsons. But Laura persisted. \u201cWe\u2019ve done everything they told us to do. We\u2019ve saved our money. We\u2019ve worked for the same company for decades. We\u2019ve done everything, and I keep looking to the future \u2014 and I can\u2019t stomach having to work until I\u2019m 65 years old just because we can\u2019t afford health care otherwise,\u201d she said. \u201c[The US] has set up a system where even if we have the money to cover our day-to-day expenses \u2014 rent, food, travel \u2014 all of a sudden there\u2019s this other line item called health care. That\u2019s about $1,500 a month, more than our house payment.\u201d Chris and Laura have traveled to Portugal three times to look for places to settle and have a three-year plan set in place to move there permanently. There are a lot of upsides: The weather is favorable year-round, it\u2019s affordable, private health insurance costs about $300 per month for couples and there\u2019s a better sense of work-life balance. (CNN converted prices throughout this story into US dollars from local currencies.) But there are also some downsides. Leaving behind family is a big one. Until the Barnetts receive their residency card, they\u2019ll only be allowed to leave and enter Portugal twice, and their initial arrival into the country counts. \u201cWe have aging parents in their late 80s.\u00a0Not having the freedom to easily respond if we are needed until we have that card is very concerning. Being lonely and not having friends and having to start from scratch with that is also in this mix,\u201d said Laura. Portuguese is not an easy language to learn, and adapting to a new culture late in life won\u2019t be easy. Recent revisions to Portuguese immigration programs also make the tax situation much less favorable for Americans. But in the end, the finances won out. \u201cOur goal, which is very doable based on research, is to live on less than $3,500 per month in Portugal while still being able to afford travel in Europe,\u201d said Laura. Their financial adviser told them that to comfortably retire in the US, they\u2019d need to have about double that amount \u2014 $7,000 per month. Packing up shop As America\u2019s retirement crisis grows, so too does the dream of retiring abroad. It\u2019s becoming increasingly expensive to retire in the US. Just 43% of non-retired adults in the US think they will have enough money to live comfortably when they retire, according to Gallup in 2023. That\u2019s the lowest level for that metric since 2012. At the same time, the number of Americans looking to settle outside of the country has tripled over the past 30 years, according to a 2024 Monmouth poll. The number of Social Security recipients living outside the US increased from 307,000 in 2008 to more than 450,000 in 2022. Some countries are even taking advantage of this boom and have eased their visa requirements to attract older US expats. But packing up a life and moving it abroad is not a simple task, and retirees often find themselves in over their heads. \u201cPeople need to think about estate planning, which is often different abroad,\u201d said Brett Spencer, the founder of Impact Financial, a financial advisory firm that specializes in Americans living abroad. \u201cThey need to think about currency, complicated taxes and their investments. Even opening a bank account abroad can be complicated.\u201d Spencer says he\u2019s had clients who have had their bank accounts closed with no warning, leaving them working through nuanced protocol in another language and without access to any funds. These types of complications aren\u2019t uncommon. Escape to Italy Patience Dunbar, who will be 63 next month, and her husband, Charles Ippoliti, 69, have been living full time in Arona, a lakeside town in northern Italy, since 2022. Their typical day consists of coffee and the crossword, a leisurely stroll around the lake, stops at the local outdoor market for fresh fruit and vegetables and a lunch in the town square. Occasionally, they\u2019ll take the train into Milan, about 40 minutes away. \u201cIt\u2019s a very leisurely pace,\u201d said Charles. They feel healthier than they did back home, they\u2019ve lost weight and they are exercising more. That\u2019s part of the reason they decided to look abroad in the first place. In 2020, when the couple was living in Oregon, Charles suffered from severe Covid complications. He was hospitalized for a few weeks and then put on oxygen at home for a few more. \u201cWe thought \u2018well this is silly, why are we wasting our time?\u2019 As soon as we could we decided to make the most of this,\u201d said Patience. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to wait five more years until Charles was in his late 70s to retire. What if he\u2019s not able to enjoy those years?\u201d The pair applied for their codice fiscale, similar to a Social Security number, and purchased their apartment in Arona. They paid about $72,000 for their first apartment there and later sold it and upgraded to a larger home for $160,000. The food is less expensive and a fancy dinner with wine runs them about $55. Most importantly, they pay $2,200 a year for their health care. That includes visits with specialists for Charles, who has a heart condition. But it\u2019s hard to be away from family, and they have struggled to learn Italian. They thought the language would come more easily. Dealing with the government can be troubling at times, and filing paperwork has become a full-time job for them. Plus, they\u2019re starting to worry about the political landscape. Giorgia Meloni, a far-right leader, is the current Italian premier and has anti-immigration views. They worry that policy could change and they might have to go back to the States. We\u2019re not in Kansas anymore \u201cI would say that, without a doubt, whatever lifestyle you want, you\u2019ll be able to find it at a lower cost than you could in the United States,\u201d said Kathleen Peddicord, the founder and CEO of advisory firm Live and Invest Overseas. \u201cUnless the lifestyle you want is living in a small town in the Midwest,\u201d she added. \u201cIf what you want in retirement is to live in a small town, surrounded by your family and your grandkids, that\u2019s great.\u201d Living abroad isn\u2019t for everyone. It probably won\u2019t work for those who seek out creature comforts in their retirement. \u201cIt\u2019s hard work. I think that\u2019s the reality that a lot of people probably aren\u2019t prepared for,\u201d said Peddicord, who splits her time with her husband between Paris and Panama City, Panama. Some people Peddicord advises don\u2019t make it to another country because they get burned out by the loads of administrative work involved. \u201cYou have to create a whole new life for yourself in a very short space of time, in another culture, in another language,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of the things that you do to create your life in the States: You got a driver\u2019s license at 15 or 16, you opened a bank account, you got your first credit card, you bought a car, you rented a house, you paid utilities, you did all that over time. Now you have to do it at once and without the support of friends and family.\u201d Many people who make the move end up feeling isolated and lonely. Still, Peddicord says her business has exploded as more Americans retire abroad, and a cottage industry to help people navigate the nuances of the task has quickly sprung up. South of the border As retirement decisions loomed for Bill and Jacki Dahl, now 69 and 75, respectively, they were forced to confront the fact that their retirement income would not continue to support the same lifestyle they had enjoyed in the US while working. They decided that moving to a less expensive country was a good way to stretch their dollar and keep their lifestyle the same. After four years of research and four exploratory trips, they made the move to Quer\u00e9taro, a city in the center of Mexico. In 2019, the Dahls sold nearly everything they had accumulated during 30 years of marriage \u2014 including their home in Oregon \u2014 to fund the trip, said goodbye to their four children and grandchildren, and drove to Mexico. Upon arriving, they finalized their official immigration documents \u2014 they\u2019re both \u201cresidente-permanente,\u201d permanent residents, meaning they\u2019re still US citizens. They rent a three-bedroom, two-story home with a large garden for about $940 a month. Food is cheap, and they have Medicare so that they can return to the United States for any serious medical care. But for smaller things, they remain local \u2014 it costs about $35 to visit the dentist, for example. \u201cWe live on a fixed monthly income,\u201d said Bill. \u201cWe do not have a bunch of savings. We do not have a bunch of investments,\u201d but they\u2019re able to get by and still have money left over for travel and adventure. \u201cWe both adore people, art, food, travel and cultural diversity,\u201d said Bill. \u201cWe love it here.\u201d Still, it hasn\u2019t been smooth sailing. \u201cRelocation to Mexico is not for everyone,\u201d he warned. Climate change means that there are more droughts in Mexico and more pollution, water can be scarce, and sometimes the power goes out, said Bill. Another surprise for the Dahls has been the rising strength of the peso against the US dollar. Bill estimates that his purchasing power is now worth about 30% less than it was before the pandemic. The financial requirements for legal, permanent residency in Mexico have also increased substantially, and immigration services are \u201ccumbersome and inefficient,\u201d said Bill. Violence is on the rise ahead of national elections later this year, he added. It\u2019s not for the faint of heart, or people who want a carefree retirement, he said. But, he added, \u201cwe have no desire whatsoever to return to live in the US\u2026we are deeply grateful to be resident-guests of such a marvelous place to live during the retirement season of our life.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/economy/more-americans-are-retiring-abroad-heres-why/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security", "text": "The Federal Trade Commission is investigating TikTok for its data and security practices, two sources told CNN on the condition of anonymity. The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_media_trump-unified-reich", "text": "The phrase \u201cunified Reich,\u201d which appeared in a video posted by the Trump campaign and caused a firestorm of controversy, appears to have originated as placeholder text in a collection of video templates created in 2023 by a 30-year-old Turkish freelance graphic designer. The video, posted and subsequently removed by the Trump campaign earlier this week, included imagined headlines that newspapers might run if former President Donald Trump is reelected. Among them: \u201cWhat\u2019s next for America,\u201d under which the fictional article displays language that many associate with Nazi Germany, including the phrase, \u201ccreation of a unified Reich.\u201d The reference was condemned by President Joe Biden, and the Trump campaign said it didn\u2019t create the video \u2013 it was reposted by a staffer who didn\u2019t see that particular text. Bizarrely, the fake article\u2019s text appears to trace its origins to a graphic designer named Enes \u015eim\u015fek who lives near Istanbul. In an exclusive interview with CNN, \u015eim\u015fek said that the Trump ad appears to have been created from video graphics he built in May of last year, designed to give customers the option of building something that looked like an old-fashioned newsreel. \u015eim\u015fek said he actually searched Google for text about World War I \u2013 not World War II \u2013 and copied language he found and pasted it into in the newspaper article: \u201cGerman industrial strength and production had significantly increased after 1871, driven by the creation of a unified Reich.\u201d As first reported by the AP, the phrase appeared to have been lifted from a Wikipedia entry on World War I. According to Wikipedia\u2019s logs, that phrase was created on November 15, 2022, and it has since been removed. The phrase does not reference Nazi Germany. It was supposed to be dummy text \u2013 placeholder language that the customer could ultimately replace, he said. \u015eim\u015fek built the template to allow the customer who purchased it to swap in their own language. But \u015eim\u015fek believes the Trump video kept the text from his original template. \u015eim\u015fek says he has sold just 16 copies of the template at $21 a pop. It has appeared in at least two other online videos: a French-language video posted to Facebook that contains the dummy text and a music video posted to YouTube. They appear to have no political context. CNN discovered the video template on Video Hive, a motion graphics template store. After \u015eim\u015fek\u00a0was contacted through the contact form on the video template page, he responded via email that he was the creator of the template. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it is my power to change politics \u2026 I don\u2019t know what could be crazier than that,\u201d said \u015eim\u015fek in a video call. \u201cImagine if your work shakes a country.\u201d A web cache confirms the template dates back at least a year, long before the Trump ad was shared online. What is a video template? Rather than create every video from scratch, video editors often search online graphics stores for templates they can manipulate and insert in their work. They often pay a fee to the designer for access to the template. Motion graphics templates are a useful tool in video production, noted Bill Byrne, a motion graphics designer and Lecturer of Arts and Entertainment Technologies at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201dTemplates are designed to speed up the production process and to do it quickly and cheaply,\u201d said Byrne. According to Byrne, the inclusion of the placeholder text in the final video appears to be an oversight by the video\u2019s creator. \u201cAnd an unfortunate one,\u201d he added. A flummoxed designer Outside Istanbul, \u015eim\u015fek was at his desk in his office when he noticed that his work had somehow made news in American politics. Surprised by the phrase being attributed to Trump, \u015eim\u015fek attempted to correct the record. According to an email he shared with CNN, \u015eim\u015fek sent a letter to Support@truthsocial.com with the email subject line: \u201cFrom the \u2018REICH\u2019 video template Author.\u201d \u201cHi. I am the initial author of that \u2018REICH\u2019 video template. If you need an official statement just let me know,\u201d wrote \u015eim\u015fek. He did not receive a reply. For \u015eim\u015fek, seeing his work end up in the spotlight of American politics \u2014 a country he has never even visited \u2014 has been surreal. \u201cIt\u2019s really the most unthinkable thing that\u2019s ever happened to me,\u201d said \u015eim\u015fek, who doesn\u2019t follow either American or Turkish politics. \u015eim\u015fek was again floored when he saw the video of Biden responding to the Trump video. When asked what his message to Biden about Trump\u2019s video would be, he said: \u201cThis is not his fault.\u201d \u201cAnd also, I am Enes,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to come to America.\u201d Envato, the marketplace that hosts the template, contacted \u015eim\u015fek on Thursday and gave a directive to remove the \u201cunified Reich\u201d phrase from the template or face its deletion. \u015eim\u015fek replaced the phrase, and wrote a blog post in an attempt to further clarify the story. A company spokesperson confirmed the account and said that while \u201cthe templates available on our site are always reviewed under a strict set of guidelines for appropriateness, we cannot apply the same screening to the end user and their uses of our content.\u201d \u201cWhen I was doing this job, I never even thought that one day such an event would happen,\u201d \u015eim\u015fek wrote on his blog post. \u201cBy the way, thank you to Trump for choosing my template.\u201d A history of Nazi language Trump has made several allusions to Nazi imagery in the past, including using the phrase \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\u201d when referencing immigrants, which echoed Adolf Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf. Trump also allegedly praised Hitler, according to former White House chief of staff John Kelly, who was quoted by CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto in his new book \u201cThe Return of Great Powers.\u201d Kelly commented: \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, but Hitler did some good things.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, what?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, (Hitler) rebuilt the economy.\u2019 Trump has denied the comments and that the conversation happened. The recent video shared by Trump\u2019s campaign led some critics to believe the phrase\u2019s inclusion in the video was purposeful \u2013 meant to be an ideological dog whistle. The Trump campaign did not respond directly to questions about the origins of the \u201cunified Reich\u201d language in the video but reiterated a previous statement issued earlier this week that said the ad had been reposted by a staffer. \u201cThis was not a campaign video, it was created by a random account online and reposted by a staffer who clearly did not see the word, while the President was in court,\u201d Karoline Leavitt, a campaign spokesperson, said in a statement. The Biden campaign, however, said this was part of a pattern of troubling rhetoric from Trump. \u201cThis week\u2019s video is part of a pattern and reflects Donald Trump\u2019s values and embrace of white supremacists and antisemitism,\u201d said James Singer, a Biden campaign spokesperson. \u201cHe does so repeatedly, explicitly, and with overwhelming clarity. Suggesting otherwise or excusing his behavior only aids and abets his hate.\u201d According to the Bulwark, the original source of the video was from an anonymous Pro-Trump meme account posting on X under the alias @ramble_rants. The Dilley Meme Team, a collective of pro-Trump meme makers whose ranks include @ramble_rants, did not return a request for comment. \u015eim\u015fek, aware of the controversy, urged people to chill out. \u201cI love all the American people,\u201d \u015eim\u015fek said. \u201cAnd please calm down. This is just a template. And, also, I\u2019m not a Nazi.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/media/trump-unified-reich/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning.

Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

The suits, which accuse the companies of \u201cgrooming\u201d the Robb Elementary School shooter,\u00a0come after 19 families of students and teachers killed\u00a0at the school announced on Wednesday that\u00a0they settled a lawsuit with the city for $2 million. The companies \u2013 Meta, Activision\u00a0and Daniel Defense \u2013 all contributed to the behavior of\u00a0the\u00a0shooter\u00a0Salvador Ramos\u00a0in one way or another, the suits allege. Ramos\u00a0downloaded\u00a0the video game\u00a0\u201cCall of Duty: Modern Warfare\u201d in November 2021, according to the complaint filed in California against the publisher of the game, Activision, Meta, and others. The game featured a weapon from Daniel Defense called the DDM4 V7, which served as \u201ca teaser for players eager to try out the weapon,\u201d the suit alleges. At the same time, Ramos\u00a0\u201cwas being courted through explicit, aggressive marketing,\u201d on Instagram, the suit said. Meta\u00a0is the parent company of Instagram. \u201cIn addition to hundreds of images depicting and glorifying the thrill of combat, Daniel Defense used Instagram to extol the illegal, murderous use of its weapons,\u201d the suit said. \u201cWithin weeks of downloading Modern Warfare, the Shooter was browsing assault weapons, acquiring firearm attachments popularized by the game, and returning repeatedly to Daniel Defense\u2019s website.\u201d \u201cMere minutes after midnight on May 16\u2014the Shooter\u2019s 18th birthday\u2014he purchased a DDM4V7,\u201d the suit said. \u201cEight days later, the Shooter inflicted unspeakable violence at Robb Elementary School, killing 21 and injuring and traumatizing many more.\u201d Investigators in the Uvalde shooting found\u00a0one of Ramos\u2019 AR15-style rifles, manufactured by Daniel Defense, in the school,\u00a0according to then-Texas state Sen. John Whitmire, who is now the mayor of Houston. \u201cThe Defendants bear responsibility for this profound corruption of our children,\u201d the suit filed in California Superior Court in Los Angeles says. \u201cIn concert with certain firearm manufacturers, they have groomed a generation of young men who are socially vulnerable, insecure about their masculinity, and eager to show strength and assert dominance.\u201d According to the suit filed in Uvalde, Texas District Court, Daniel Defense\u00a0courts adolescents by harnessing and exploiting \u201cthe power of social media and first-person shooter simulations to lure teenagers to its website where it can monitor their online activity, build a profile of their interests, and solicit their contact information.\u201d In a statement,\u00a0Josh\u00a0Koskoff,\u00a0a\u00a0partner at\u00a0Koskoff,\u00a0Koskoff\u00a0& Bieder and\u00a0an\u00a0attorney for the families said:\u00a0\u201cThere is a direct line between the conduct of these companies and the Uvalde shooting.\u00a0Just 23 minutes after midnight on his 18th birthday, the Uvalde shooter bought an AR-15 made by a company with a market share of less than one percent. Why? Because, well before he was old enough to purchase it, he was targeted and cultivated online by Instagram, Activision and Daniel Defense. This three-headed monster knowingly exposed him to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as a tool to solve his problems and trained him to use it.\u201d A company spokesperson for Activision said in a statement to CNN Friday: \u201cThe Uvalde shooting was horrendous and heartbreaking in every way, and we express our deepest sympathies to the families and communities who remain impacted by this senseless act of violence.

{"id": "2024_05_22_tech_how-ai-and-bionics-are-helping-ukrainian-soldiers-return-to-action", "text": "Valera Kucherenko had already served a term in the Ukrainian army when Russia invaded in 2022. But he joined back up and, on a fateful October night in 2023, lost both hands in a grenade attack. It\u2019s a story that\u2019s\u00a0all too common for Ukrainian soldiers. Since the start of the war, an estimated 20,000 Ukrainians\u00a0have lost limbs.\u00a0Such injuries typically\u00a0end\u00a0military careers, but advancements\u00a0in bionics are\u00a0enabling\u00a0some veterans to resume what they see as their\u00a0duty. \u201cFor me, prosthetics were made in such a way that I\u2019m returning back to the army,\u201d Kucherenko\u00a0told CNN. Kucherenko was fitted with two bionic hands that are\u00a0new to the market.\u00a0The Esper Hand is the first product from Esper Bionics, a Ukrainian-US based company focused on next-generation\u00a0prosthetics. Artificial\u00a0Intelligence\u00a0is disrupting\u00a0many industries, but it is also offering up unprecedented solutions. In the field of bionic prosthetics, AI or machine learning can help\u00a0patients who\u2019ve lost limbs regain functions \u2013 and\u00a0perhaps even gain functions they\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0originally\u00a0have with human limbs. At least that\u2019s the hope of those at Esper. \u201cI think AI will be the next step in bionics,\u201d says Dima Gazda, CEO of Esper Bionics. Gazda, a physician and engineer from Ukraine, worked with his\u00a0team\u00a0for several years\u00a0to perfect the Esper Hand and says their systems have\u00a0been \u201cbuilt for AI since day one.\u201d In this bionic hand, AI helps the prosthetic\u00a0quickly\u00a0learn its user\u2019s behavior\u00a0and\u00a0choose hand grips the user\u00a0will need. \u201cIf I take cup from a table several times, tomorrow, the system will understand,\u201d says Gazda. The\u00a0AI-empowered\u00a0hand can also detect muscle activity. It\u2019s not just AI that is helping users regain their functions quicker. Bionic prosthetics are also being built more precisely to mimic human limbs. The Esper Hand has 6 different motors \u2013 one for each finger and two for the thumb. This allows\u00a0each finger to move separately. According to Esper Bionics, 70 Ukrainian soldiers are currently serving with Esper Hands, but the need greatly outnumbers the supply. Esper says there are currently around 170 people on the waitlist. With the fighting in Ukraine continuing every day, the number of those in need will continue to climb. Helping hand Inside an office complex about 20 minutes from Minneapolis is a clinic run by the non-profit\u00a0Protez Foundation. Every morning, a group of Ukrainian veterans gather\u00a0inside the clinic and go over the schedule for the day. Each one of the veterans is missing at least one limb, in some cases two to three. Their schedules will consist of prosthetic fittings and training. Those with prosthetic legs will practice walking; those with prosthetic hands, like Kucherenko, will practice movements like building with blocks. The clinic is run by Yakov Gradinar, the Protez Foundation\u2019s chief medical officer. Gradinar is a Ukrainian prosthetist living in Minnesota, who co-founded Protez a couple of months after the war started in 2022.\u00a0\u201cProtez\u201d\u00a0means\u00a0\u201cprosthetic\u201d\u00a0in Ukrainian. \u201cYou search for meaning in your life,\u201d Gradinar said. \u201cUkraine needed prosthetics, and I\u2019m a prosthetist. I can help.\u201d The Protez Foundation and Esper Bionics have partnered together through a special initiative to help Ukrainians. Esper Bionics sells the Esper Hand (which normally sell for around $20,000) to Protez at manufacturing costs, and then Protez\u00a0fits them to users for free. Gradinar has noted the speed with which veterans are adapting to the Esper Hands. His patient Valera Kucherenko \u2013 who lost both arms in that grenade attack \u2014 is now back in Ukraine with plans to re-join the army and train soldiers. The veterans\u2019 personal grit and motivation play a big role. But so too does the technology. \u201cWe often talk about negativity [around AI], but we don\u2019t talk about the part that technology can be adapting itself,\u201d the prosthetist says.\u00a0The hope is the technology will help bionic prosthetics get better and smarter. Esper is\u00a0currently working on a leg model and\u00a0an exoskeleton. The long view for Esper is health devices that\u00a0help all of humanity, but right now, there is a central focus on helping those in Ukraine. \u201cOur dedication is to help people who have the biggest need,\u201d Gazda said. \u201cI think by working together with the Protez Foundation, we are making Ukraine stronger.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/tech/how-ai-and-bionics-are-helping-ukrainian-soldiers-return-to-action/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_business_nvidias-stock-split-earnings-results", "text": "Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split on Wednesday, making buying shares in the red-hot semiconductor company more accessible for individual investors. Five years ago, an investor could have purchased Nvidia stock for less than $50 a share. But since then, the stock has exploded more than 2,500%. A single share in the company was worth $949.50 as of Wednesday\u2019s close. Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) announcement, which came in its quarterly earnings report, means that each common share will be split into 10 smaller shares, effectively cutting the price of investing in the company. The company posted yet another quarter of strong financial results on Wednesday, as well. Nvidia reported a 262% increase in revenue and a 462% increase in profits year-over-year. Nvidia\u2019s post-split shares will begin trading at the market open on June 10, coming at a time when Nvidia\u2019s stock has been on a tear, fueled by investor enthusiasm about the company\u2019s role in artificial intelligence. Nvidia shares rose as much as 4% in after-hours trading following the report. Nvidia is crucial to the burgeoning AI space. The American chipmaker is unmatched in producing processors that power artificial intelligence systems, including for generative AI, the buzzy new technology that can create text, images and other media.  And the company\u2019s soaring stock price over the past year means Nvidia is now deeply important to the broader market, too. The company has become something of a bellwether for the larger AI boom that has been driving the recent market rally. That the company was again able to exceed Wall Street\u2019s predications for its booming sales growth on Wednesday isn\u2019t entirely surprising. Many of the major tech giants, including Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and others, have announced in recent weeks that they\u2019re continuing to pour billions of dollars into building AI infrastructure, and no company is better poised to be the beneficiary of that investment than Nvidia. Still, some investors had raised questions ahead of Wednesday\u2019s report about just how long Nvidia could keep the rally going. The company faces growing competition from in-house AI chips from Amazon and Alphabet, and it has had to contend with US restrictions on exports of advanced AI chips to China. \u201cThere was no secret around Wall Street that Nvidia\u2019s earnings would come in hot once again,\u201d Investing.com senior analyst Thomas Monteiro said in a statement following the report. \u201cWhile the company didn\u2019t repeat the same total blowout from the last few quarters in any specific area, today\u2019s numbers remain incredibly strong, leaving no doubt that the company\u2019s leadership in the AI revolution remains unchallenged for now.\u201d Nvidia said it expects revenue for the current quarter to grow approximately 107% year-over-year, a slight slowdown from the meteoric sales growth the company has posted over the past few quarters as it hits the one-year mark from when the AI boom began to take off.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/business/nvidias-stock-split-earnings-results/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_business_russian-frozen-assets-g7-ukraine", "text": "Money generated by Russian financial assets frozen in Europe will soon start flowing to Ukraine, giving Kyiv a boost as it struggles to counter an advance by Moscow\u2019s troops. Now, the West is trying to turn that trickle of cash into a flood. Finance officials from the G7 economies met in Stresa, Italy to discuss\u00a0new ways of using the proceeds from some \u20ac260 billion ($282 billion) of Russia\u2019s foreign currency reserves that were frozen by Western countries after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. \u201cProgress has been made \u2026 as far as the main issues are concerned,\u201d Italian Economy Minister\u00a0Giancarlo\u00a0Giorgetti\u00a0said Saturday during a press conference after the meeting, adding that there are some legal technical issues that still have to be resolved. There is \u201cstrong positioning in terms of a political stance by all the G7 countries,\u201d Giorgetti said. The G7 meeting comes just weeks after Russia mounted a surprise assault in Ukraine\u2019s northern Kharkiv region. As Russia\u2019s attacks intensify, Western leaders are coming under increasing pressure to deliver military aid to Kyiv\u2019s stretched armed forces. It is \u201cvital and urgent that we collectively find a way forward to unlock the value of Russian sovereign assets immobilized in our jurisdictions for the benefit of Ukraine,\u201d US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said during a speech Tuesday in Frankfurt, Germany. The proposal that reportedly has the broadest backing among US and EU officials involves lending as much as $50 billion to Ukraine, using the future windfall profits from Russian assets held in the European Union as collateral. The plan \u201cwould essentially bring forward that flow of interest proceeds from the assets\u2026 (through a loan) given to Ukraine,\u201d Yellen told broadcaster Sky News in an interview this week. \u201cUkraine has substantial needs, and being able to marshal significant resources to help Ukraine is important,\u201d she said. G7 finance ministers hope to agree on a way forward that can be signed off when President Joe Biden and other leaders meet for a summit in Italy next month. The plan stops short of seizing the assets outright. The EU is worried that such a move would discourage other countries from keeping their assets in the bloc. Most of the frozen Russian money is held in Europe, and the euro is the world\u2019s second-most important currency after the US dollar. The proposal \u201cis a halfway house to full seizure,\u201d Lee Buccheit, a veteran sovereign debt expert and honorary professor at the University of Edinburgh Law School, told CNN. From $3 billion to $50 billion? Around two-thirds of Russia\u2019s immobilized assets, or some \u20ac210 billion ($228 billion), sits in the EU, mostly at Euroclear, a Belgium-based financial institution that keeps assets safe for banks, exchanges and investors. Following months of discussions, the EU formally adopted an agreement Tuesday that taps the windfall profits Euroclear makes by reinvesting the cash generated by those assets \u2014 such as coupon payments on bonds. Western sanctions mean coupon payments and maturing assets cannot be sent to Russia. Under the EU agreement, between \u20ac2.5 and \u20ac3 billion ($2.7-3.3 billion) of these profits will be sent annually to Kyiv. The first payment will be made in July, with 90% earmarked for arms and military equipment. The split of funds will be reviewed each year starting in January 2025, with the option to shift spending toward rebuilding Ukraine\u2019s war-torn economy as its needs change. \u201cThe EU has chosen a way forward that is legally sound, and flexible so that support can adjust to Ukraine\u2019s most pressing needs,\u201d European Commissioner for Trade Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement Tuesday. Unlike the drip feed of funding agreed by the EU, the proposal under discussion by the G7 could deliver a much bigger lump sum, immediately.  Reuters reported Yellen as saying Thursday that a figure of $50 billion had been discussed by G7 ministers but there was no agreement yet on how big the collateralized loan should be. An even bigger check? Apart from seizing the stash of assets, or lending Kyiv money backed by the interest they earn, there\u2019s a third option the West might consider \u2014 a so-called reparations loan. Under this approach, Ukraine would borrow money from a syndicate of allies, including G7 members, and pledge as collateral its claim for reparations \u2014 or compensation \u2014 against Russia. This would give Kyiv access to a much larger amount of money than using future or current windfall profits from Russian assets. \u201cUkraine has a claim against Russia for reparations \u2014 legally, that is indubitable \u2014 and it would in effect be monetizing a portion of that claim by pledging it to secure this loan from the G7,\u201d Buchheit, the debt expert, said. If Russia failed to pay reparations, then the G7 would be in a position to draw on the pool of frozen assets to recover the value of its loan to Ukraine, he added. This mechanism also ensures that Russia foots part of the colossal bill for rebuilding Ukraine, which the World Bank has put at $486 billion over the next decade. \u201cShort of a regime change in Russia, Putin is never going to pay reparations,\u201d said Buccheit. \u201cThis $300 billion is probably the only contribution Russia will ever make for paying reparations for what it has done to Ukraine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/business/russian-frozen-assets-g7-ukraine/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_media_newsmax-smartmatic-defamation-case", "text": "The right-wing cable channel Newsmax denied Friday that it intentionally destroyed or concealed internal emails in an ongoing defamation case filed by voting technology company Smartmatic over\u00a0the network\u2019s airing of false\u00a0claims about the 2020 election. Lawyers for Smartmatic previously claimed Newsmax \u201cconcealed over 200,000 documents\u201d and \u201cmade multiple material misrepresentations to the court,\u201d by falsely asserting\u00a0it\u00a0had turned over everything before the discovery process wrapped up. But the network said in filings Friday that it never meant to hide anything, and that the vast majority of the supposedly new materials were duplicates of old files. Newsmax said the allegations are\u00a0\u201cimplausible inferences\u201d and \u201cnothing more than speculation.\u201d In the wake of the 2020 election, Newsmax and other right-wing media outlets gave\u00a0airtime\u00a0to the\u00a0false\u00a0assertion that electronic voting machines had switched votes from then-President Donald Trump to Joe Biden, costing Trump the election. No evidence has ever been found to support the claim. In the months that followed, Smartmatic filed a defamation lawsuit against Newsmax and other right-wing outlets and figures, including Fox News, Rudy Giuliani and conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell.\u00a0Smartmatic and Newsmax have\u00a0since\u00a0been embroiled in the\u00a0years-long defamation case,\u00a0which\u00a0is slated to go to trial this September in Delaware Superior Court, barring an out-of-court settlement. In court filings, Smartmatic claimed some of the 200,000 documents include texts among Newsmax executives discussing the \u201cdecision not to call the (2020) election.\u201d Parts of the court papers are redacted, but the context suggests that Newsmax also turned over new emails where top executives disparaged their own shows and reporters. Smartmatic further accused Newsmax of intentionally \u201cdestroying relevant evidence\u201d by deleting texts and emails from senior officials. They claimed this \u201ccover-up\u201d was \u201ccarefully calculated\u201d to block Smartmatic from ever seeing the material. They claimed Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy let his texts from 2020 get deleted, despite knowing they needed to be saved. \u201cRepeatedly, Newsmax has kept documents showing its actual malice and bad motive out of Smartmatic\u2019s hands,\u201d Smartmatic wrote in a court filing that was made public last week. \u201cThese were not isolated mistakes. This was by design. Newsmax has intentionally destroyed and concealed crucial evidence that is damaging to its case.\u201d But in its response Friday, Newsmax said the entire dispute over the newly found files is simply \u201can attempt (by Smartmatic) to manufacture an issue where none exists.\u201d \u201cMany of the documents Smartmatic claims were \u2018newly produced\u2019 and bear on \u2018key issues\u2019 were already in Smartmatic\u2019s possession in duplicate or near duplicate versions having been produced by Newsmax,\u201d the network said in filings made public Friday. Lawyers for the network said it transitioned legal teams in January and\u00a0reviewed\u00a0its previous document productions. They said they realized that some documents hadn\u2019t been turned over, but this was fixed \u201cas soon as Newsmax discovered this.\u201d Barring a settlement between the two parties,\u00a0the September trial\u00a0over false claims of vote rigging in the 2020 election\u00a0is set\u00a0to coincide with the 2024 election season,\u00a0as leading\u00a0Republicans continue to express doubt over whether Biden legitimately won the\u00a0previous\u00a0election. Fox News famously paid more than $787 million to Dominion Voting Systems to settle a case last year\u00a0over similar 2020 election lies on its airwaves. Newsmax, which is owned by Ruddy,\u00a0isn\u2019t a\u00a0right-wing\u00a0media juggernaut\u00a0like Fox, but\u00a0remains\u00a0influential in the pro-Trump media ecosystem, even with its smaller audience. The network\u2019s lineup features\u00a0former\u00a0Fox personalities like\u00a0Eric Bolling\u00a0and Greta Van Susteren, controversial Trump White House official\u00a0Sebastian Gorka\u00a0and Clinton ally-turned-foe Dick Morris. A trial could put Newsmax\u2019s financial future in peril, but there is one major difference between the Newsmax and Fox cases.\u00a0In the weeks following the election, Smartmatic threatened to sue Newsmax in 2020,\u00a0the network\u00a0ran an on-air segment\u00a0and\u00a0published an article saying there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that Smartmatic or Dominion ever \u201cmanipulated votes in the 2020 election.\u201d Newsmax also faces a\u00a0separate\u00a0defamation suit from Dominion.

{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_tech_fcc-weighs-ai-rules-political-ads", "text": "The Federal Communications Commission is taking initial steps toward new rules that could require political ads on TV and radio to include disclaimers about the use of artificial intelligence. On Wednesday, FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel called on other agency commissioners to support such regulations amid growing fears that AI-generated deepfakes could disrupt elections. \u201cAs artificial intelligence tools become more accessible, the Commission wants to make sure consumers are fully informed when the technology is used,\u201d Rosenworcel said in a news release.\u00a0\u201cToday, I\u2019ve shared with my colleagues a proposal that makes clear consumers have a right to know when AI tools are being used in the political ads they see, and I hope they swiftly act on this issue.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s proposal aims to open a rulemaking process at the FCC that would likely take months to play out. The proposal calls for new rules governing broadcast TV and radio, as well as cable and satellite providers. Under the proposed rules, political advertisers on those mediums would have to make on-air disclosures if their ads contain AI-generated content. The FCC does not regulate internet-based media such as streaming video services or social media. As part of the proposed rule, political advertisers would also have to provide written disclosures in the files that broadcasters are\u00a0required to make available\u00a0to the public. The FCC move seeks to fill\u00a0a yawning gap\u00a0in the regulation of artificial intelligence in political advertising. Existing US election law prohibits campaigns from \u201cfraudulently misrepresenting other candidates or political parties,\u201d but whether this prohibition extends to AI-generated content is an open question. Last summer,\u00a0Republicans on the Federal Election Commission blocked\u00a0a move that could have made clear the law extended to AI-created depictions; the FEC has since agreed to revive the discussion, but it has not reached a decision on the matter. In the meantime, some US lawmakers have proposed legislation that could clamp down on AI in elections. In March, a bipartisan proposal by Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski unveiled the\u00a0AI Transparency in Elections Act, which could require AI disclaimers on political ads. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, has stressed the urgent need for Congress to create guardrails for artificial intelligence, particularly for elections. Last week, he and a bipartisan group of senators\u00a0released a blueprint\u00a0for legislative action. But many\u00a0policy analysts doubt\u00a0that Congress can pass meaningful AI legislation during an election year. Online platforms such as Meta have taken their own steps to address AI in political ads,\u00a0requiring campaigns\u00a0to disclose the use of deepfakes and banning the use of its\u00a0in-house generative AI tools\u00a0for political advertising.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/tech/fcc-weighs-ai-rules-political-ads/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_25_business_red-lobster-bankruptcy-thai-union", "text": "When seafood conglomerate Thai Union Group became Red Lobster\u2019s leading shareholder in 2020, gaining 49% control of the chain, Red Lobster employees were assured Thai Union would not interfere in key decisions. Thai Union will \u201cnot be involved in Red Lobster\u2019s day-to-day operations, including [its] supply chain standards and processes,\u201d according to a document titled \u201cSeafood Supplier Talking Points\u201d viewed by CNN that was approved by top Thai Union and Red Lobster executives. \u201cWe intend to maintain relationships with all current seafood suppliers,\u201d the talking points said. Those pledges didn\u2019t last. By 2022, representatives from Thai Union in Thailand, whose $4 billion empire includes brands like Chicken of the Sea and John West Foods, were embedded in Red Lobster\u2019s Orlando headquarters, serving in top roles and closely directing the largest seafood restaurant chain in the world. \u201cWe are much deeper involved in the management of Red Lobster,\u201d Thai Union finance chief Ludovic Garnier said on an analyst call in November 2022. Now, Red Lobster has drowned in a relentless supply of Thai Union-supplied shrimp. Red Lobster filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Sunday, and it plans to sell its business to its lenders. In turn, Red Lobster will receive financing to stay afloat. Thai Union\u2019s damaging decisions drove the pioneering chain\u2019s fall, according to 13 former Red Lobster executives and senior leaders in various areas of the business as well as analysts. All but two of the former Red Lobster employees spoke to CNN under the condition of anonymity because of either non-disclosure agreements with Thai Union; fear that speaking out would harm their careers; or because they don\u2019t want to jeopardize deferred compensation from Red Lobster. Thai Union earlier this year blamed the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as \u201csustained industry headwinds, higher interest rates and rising material and labor costs\u201d for Red Lobster\u2019s struggles. In a statement to CNN, Thai Union said it \u201chas a been a supplier to Red Lobster for more than 30 years, and we intend for that relationship to continue.\u201d A bankruptcy process \u201cwill allow Red Lobster to restructure its financial obligations and realize its long-term potential in a more favorable operating environment,\u201d the company said.\u00a0Thai Union did not respond to CNN\u2019s questions about the specific allegations raised in this story. Former Red Lobster employees say that while the pandemic, inflation and rent costs impacted Red Lobster, Thai Union\u2019s ineptitude was the pivotal factor in Red Lobster\u2019s decline. \u201cIt was miserable working there for the last year and a half I was there,\u201d said Les Foreman, a West Coast division vice president who worked at Red Lobster for 20 years and was fired in 2022. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have any idea about running a restaurant company in the United States.\u201d Thai Union asserts control At Red Lobster headquarters, employees prided themselves on a fiercely loyal culture and low turnover. Some employees had been with the chain for 30 and 40 years. But as Thai Union installed executives at the chain, dozens of veteran Red Lobster leaders with deep knowledge of the brand and restaurant industry were fired or resigned in rapid succession. Red Lobster ended up having five CEOs in five years. Thai Union CEO Thiraphong Chansiri visited Red Lobster\u2019s headquarters in 2022 and toured restaurants around the country. He brought along a feng shui consultant named Angel to Orlando, former senior leaders at Red Lobster headquarters told CNN. The consultant determined that executive offices in Orlando were \u201cbad Feng shui and no one should use them,\u201d one former leader told CNN. The executive offices sat empty. Former Red Lobster employees describe a toxic and demoralizing environment as Thai Union-appointed executives descended on headquarters and interim CEO Paul Kenny eventually took over the chain in 2022. Kenny, an Australian-born former CEO of Minor Food, one of Asia\u2019s largest casual dining and quick-service restaurants, was part of the Thai Union-led investor group that acquired Red Lobster. Kenny criticized Red Lobster employees at meetings and made derogatory comments about them, according to former Red Lobster leaders who worked closely with Kenny. Commenting on a woman\u2019s weight at a Red Lobster annual conference in 2022 in Dallas as she walked across a stage to accept an award, Kenny said, \u201cwe need to institute an exercise program in this company,\u201d another former Red Lobster executive told CNN. Kenny did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment on these allegations. Under Kenny, Red Lobster also cut two of its longtime shrimp suppliers\u2014 and competitors to Thai Union \u2014 to purchase more shrimp from Thai Union at higher costs, according to Red Lobster\u2019s bankruptcy filing. Kenny\u2019s decision came \u201cin apparent coordination with Thai Union and under the guise of a \u2018quality review,\u2019\u201d Red Lobster said. These changes culminated in a $20 endless shrimp promotion in 2023 that would come back to haunt Red Lobster. \u201cThai Union exercised an outsized influence on the Company\u2019s shrimp purchasing,\u201d Red Lobster alleged in its bankruptcy filing. Red Lobster said it was \u201cinvestigating whether Mr. Kenny\u2019s decision-making process circumvented the Company\u2019s normal supply chain and demand planning.\u201d Thai Union told CNN that Red Lobster\u2019s accusations in the bankruptcy filing were \u201cmeritless,\u201d and the company looks forward to a \u201cfull representation of the facts.\u201d Red Lobster also slowed investments in dining room upgrades, raised prices and cut labor under Thai Union, former executives and operations leaders say. These decisions pushed away customers and cut into Red Lobster\u2019s sales. Red Lobster\u2019s annual customer count has dropped by 30% since 2019, Red Lobster said in its bankruptcy filing. Paul Kenny steps in Red Lobster was started in 1968 by Bill Darden, an architect of the casual dining revolution in America. General Mills quickly bought Red Lobster and in 1995 spun the chain off into a new company, Darden Restaurants, named after its founder. In 2014, Darden sold Red Lobster to Golden Gate Capital, a private equity firm, for $2.1 billion.\u00a0 To help fund the deal, Red Lobster spun off its real estate. The arrangement wound up hurting Red Lobster because it became stuck with leases it no longer could afford to pay as the business struggled. Two years later, Thai Union took a $575 million minority stake in Red Lobster. In 2020, Thai Union expanded that stake, leading an investor group to buy out Golden Gate Capital and acquire Red Lobster. During the first half of 2021, Red Lobster posted an operating profit, and Thai Union touted Red Lobster\u2019s strength on calls with analysts and company presentations. \u201cRed Lobster\u2019s turnaround continued amid the pandemic,\u201d Thai Union said in a quarterly earnings presentation in August of 2021. There was \u201cclear improvement in Red Lobster operations.\u201d Red Lobster re-hired 26,000 employees from January to August of 2021, Thai Union said in the presentation, and appointed Kelli Valade CEO. Valade brought on a new leadership team, including a new head of finance, chief marketing officer and chief information officer. But Kenny, then a Red Lobster board member, soon began exercising more control. In early 2022, Kenny began visiting Red Lobster\u2019s headquarters more frequently and touring restaurants, former Red Lobster employees who worked closely with Kenny say. At a tense board meeting in late March 2022, Kenny disagreed with Valade that significant further investment was needed in Red Lobster, according to a former Red Lobster leader. He chastised Red Lobster\u2019s management team, which included Valade\u2019s three recently hired executives, this person said. Within 48 hours, Valade resigned, just eight months into her tenure. Another Red Lobster board member who had decades of experience running casual dining restaurants in the United States resigned a day after. Valade was appointed Denny\u2019s CEO two months later. She did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Severe cuts Kenny was initially described in a press release announcing Valade\u2019s resignation as a \u201cliaison\u201d between Red Lobster\u2019s leadership and the board of directors \u201cduring this time of transition.\u201d But, at the direction of Thai Union, Kenny became interim CEO, according to Red Lobster\u2019s bankruptcy filing. In the months after Kenny took over, Valade\u2019s leadership team and other veteran leaders left. In July of 2022, the chief operations officer and six vice presidents of operations overseeing restaurants were abruptly fired shortly before Red Lobster\u2019s annual general manager conference. Kenny appointed a Thai Union frozen seafood manager, Trin Tapanya, as Red Lobster\u2019s chief operations officer overseeing restaurants. Tapanya had no experience running restaurants. He did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Other Thai Union representatives also became more closely involved across Red Lobster\u2019s supply chain, finance, operations and strategy teams. Under Kenny, changes to restaurant operations and menus alienated customers and staff and hurt sales. Red Lobster started charging for a side salad for the first time, angering some customers. \u201cWhen you spend $43.99 for a meal the salad should be part of it,\u201d one customer said recently on Facebook. \u201cTexas Roadhouse does not charge extra for a side salad. Red Lobster was my favorite place to eat, but no longer.\u201d The chain started leaving tails on shrimp in pasta and eliminated saut\u00e9 stations in kitchens to save on labor costs, according to a different former Red Lobster employee. It also squeezed Red Lobster\u2019s waitstaff, switching from servers covering three tables to 10 and removing a host at the entrance during lunch hours. Thai Union said at the time it was to improve customer service, but former Red Lobster employees say the change\u00a0taxed restaurant staff. Overstretched restaurant staff had fewer managers and cooks than ever, said Barry Fulghum, who started out as a dishwasher at Red Lobster in the 1970s and worked his way up to become an operations director, retiring last year. \u201cThere would be times we would have one or two people working the kitchen line,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \u201cWhat those cooks did on the line was amazing given the staffing situation they were dealt.\u201d Removing longtime suppliers Meanwhile, Thai Union took a larger role in Red Lobster\u2019s supply chain decisions, despite pledges in 2020 that it would not interfere. Red Lobster had spent decades developing a wide array of suppliers to buy at competitive prices and mitigate the risks of becoming too reliant on any single supplier. Thai Union blew that up. Red Lobster employees say they were pressured by Thai Union representatives to buy more seafood from Thai Union. Thai Union representatives also began sitting in on meetings between Red Lobster and seafood suppliers, said one of the former Red Lobster employees who witnessed these conversations. Thai Union was the direct competitor of these other seafood suppliers, and suddenly had intimate access to their products, prices and strategy. \u201cOur suppliers were really upset that [Thai Union representatives] were in those meetings with them,\u201d this person said. Shrimp dishes also became a larger focus of Red Lobster\u2019s menu under Thai Union, which was a large shrimp supplier to Red Lobster. \u201cEvery promotion was shrimp-centric,\u201d this person said. Endless shrimp Then came the endless shrimp. Endless shrimp had been a successful limited-time promotion at Red Lobster for nearly 20 years. But last summer, Red Lobster turned $20 \u201cUltimate Endless Shrimp\u201d into a permanent menu item instead. Kenny had been warned by Red Lobster leaders that $20 was too cheap to make a profit, according to a former employee who witnessed these conversations. But Red Lobster went ahead, turning it into an everyday offer in June 2023 and pushing the promotion heavily. (Kenny\u2019s decision was met with \u201csignificant pushback from other members of the [company\u2019s] management team,\u201d Red Lobster also said in its bankruptcy filing.) \u201cWe have a very, very bold proposition for the consumers in the US. It\u2019s $20, so it\u2019s really affordable,\u201d Thai Union finance chief Ludovic Garnier said on an earnings call in August 2023. But the move backfired. Customers sat at tables for long stretches of time, eating course after course of shrimp. Service slowed and wait times grew. Red Lobster lost $11 million following the deal, its bankruptcy filing states. Endless shrimp was an embarrassment for Red Lobster, spoofed on Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d and social media. To former Red Lobster employees, it was the latest sign Thai Union was ill-suited to run the chain. Thai Union announced in January it was divesting from Red Lobster and taking a $530 million loss on its investment. A month later, Thai Union CEO Chansiri said the company was looking to sell the chain. Red Lobster, he said, \u201cis done [and] over with.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/business/red-lobster-bankruptcy-thai-union/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
