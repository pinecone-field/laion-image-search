Millions of Americans have taken to the skies, hit the road, fired up the barbecue grill and jumped into the pool this weekend to celebrate the start of summer 2024. Analysts are expecting the Memorial Day weekend to usher in yet another summer of strong consumer spending on travel and other leisure activities. The season is already off to a solid start: The Transportation Security Administration said that Thursday was its second-busiest day at airports in history, adding that five of its 10 busiest days ever were this month. AAA projected earlier this month that 43.8 million Americans are driving at least 50 miles this weekend, up 4% from last year\u2019s total and close to the all-time record of 44 million during the 2005 Memorial Day weekend. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen Memorial Day weekend travel numbers like these in almost 20 years,\u201d Paula Twidale, senior vice president at AAA Travel, said in a release. Royal Caribbean\u2019s first-quarter earnings results topped expectations, thanks to strong bookings and robust onboard spending. Company executives said in a earnings call that they\u2019re optimistic for the remainder of the year. If this momentum persists throughout the summer, that would mean solid revenue for leisure businesses such as Royal Caribbean, hotels, restaurants and theme parks, also providing an economic boost to cities with a big tourism scene. A Bank of America Institute analysis released last week expects that to be the case. In a virtual presentation to reporters, the bank\u2019s analysts said the outlook for leisure spending this summer looks promising, based on trends reflected in the bank\u2019s card data, results from a survey of 2,010 respondents and other resources from across the bank. Spending this summer will likely be a little softer than last year\u2019s, they said, but still strong. \u201cThe strength of the data already speaks to it being a solid summer,\u201d David Tinsley, senior economist at the Bank of America Institute, said during the presentation. The bank\u2019s consumer travel survey showed that 72% of people said they\u2019re planning to travel, with 36% saying they\u2019ve already planned their trip. It showed that more younger Americans are planning to take an international trip than older generations, while also planning for longer trips and to spend more. From January through April, spending using a Bank of America card per household was the highest for Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, Colombia and Costa Rica. In April, the share of total in-person international spending through Bank of America was the highest for Europe (32%), followed by Canada and Mexico (23%), then the Caribbean (13%). Domestically, California and Florida have seen some momentum recently when it comes to spending at restaurants. In the first four months of the year, spending rose more than 5% in California from the same period a year ago, while it was mostly flat in Florida. But compared to 2019, restaurant spending in California and Florida is up roughly 15% in each state. Even among respondents making less than $75,000 a year, more than 60% said they\u2019re planning to travel this summer. That figure is north of 80% for respondents making more than $150,000 a year. But the good times may not last forever. Americans have come increasingly under pressure with household debt continuing to climb and delinquencies rising, according to New York Fed data. \u201cIn the first quarter of 2024, credit card and auto loan transition rates into serious delinquency continued to rise across all age groups,\u201d Joelle Scally, regional economic principal within the Household and Public Policy Research Division at the New York Fed, said in a statement. Inflation is also still taking a bite out of people\u2019s budgets and interest rates remain perched at a two-decade high. Economists aren\u2019t expecting a recession this year, but many are estimating the economy will slow over the next 12 months: The latest figures on employment came in weaker than expected. For some, this year\u2019s summer splurge could well be the last hurrah. The dog who inspired Dogecoin has died Kabosu, the dog who launched a thousand \u201cdoge\u201d memes, has died, her owner announced Friday. The Japanese Shiba Inu \u201cfell into a deep sleep\u201d on Friday morning at 18 years of age, Atsuko Sato wrote in a\u00a0blogpost. \u201cOutside the window, birds were singing on a beautiful morning. As I was touching her, she gently passed away,\u201d wrote Sato, a kindergarten teacher in the Japanese city of Sakura. \u201cI think she was the happiest dog in the world.\u201d Kabosu became one of the most recognizable animals on the internet back in 2010 when a photo of her posing with folded paws and a quizzical expression spread across forums such as Reddit. That sparked a proliferation of \u201cdoge\u201d memes, based on an intentional misspelling of the word \u201cdog,\u201d with internet users photoshopping Kabosu\u2019s face onto pastries, landmarks and other animals. The popularity of \u201cdoge\u201d memes was cemented in December 2013, when Kabosu became the face of alternative cryptocurrency dogecoin \u2014 a tongue-in-cheek response to bitcoin that reflected the internet\u2019s love of animal memes.

{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_business_dupont-de-nemours-company-split", "text": "DuPont de Nemours, the American multinational chemical company that traces its history back to 1802, announced plans to split into three publicly traded companies on Wednesday. The company plans to spin off its electronics and water businesses into their own yet-to-be-named companies in a transaction that is tax-free to shareholders. DuPont said it expects to complete the breakup transactions within the next 18 to 24 months, and it is subject to final approval by DuPont\u2019s board of directors. The announcement also included a shakeup in leadership: Effective June 1, DuPont\u2019s chief financial officer, Lori Koch, will step into the CEO role. DuPont\u2019s current CEO, Ed Breen, will stay on as executive chairman. Koch will remain CEO of the new, slimmed-down DuPont once the spin-offs are complete, according to the company. Shares of DuPont were slightly higher in Thursday morning trading, rising by around 1.5% after the opening bell. DuPont\u2019s breakup comes amid other large, multinational companies announcing breakups in recent years, with many CEOs and corporate boards touting the agility of smaller companies. In a statement, Breen echoed a similar refrain, saying the three smaller companies would have greater flexibility after the spin-off. \u201cThe three-way separation will unlock incremental value for shareholders and customers and also create new opportunities for employees,\u201d he said. \u201cCritically, each company will have greater flexibility to pursue their own focused growth strategies, including portfolio enhancing M&A (mergers and acquisitions).\u201d In the last several years, major American companies like J&J, Kellogg and General Electric announced company break-ups and spin-offs, signaling a preference for smaller, more nimble companies over the conglomerates that gained prominence in previous decades. This is the second DuPont breakup in half a decade. In 2019, DowDuPont, which was created in a DuPont merger with Dow Chemical, broke apart into three separate entities: DuPont, Dow Chemical and Corteva, the company\u2019s agriculture business. On Wednesday, DuPont said the newly formed electronics company would focus on \u201csemiconductor solutions and advanced electronics products,\u201d while the new water company would be \u201ca comprehensive water solutions provider.\u201d The leftover divisions will remain as part of DuPont.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/business/dupont-de-nemours-company-split/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_business_south-africa-election-economy", "text": "South Africa\u2019s ruling African National Congress (ANC) swept to power in 1994 on a\u00a0pledge\u00a0to \u201cbuild a better life for all,\u201d winning almost 63% of the vote in the country\u2019s first democratic election. Fast-forward 30 years and\u00a0Nelson Mandela\u2019s\u00a0erstwhile liberation movement, which triumphed over the racist apartheid government, risks losing its parliamentary majority for the first time, according to opinion polls and analysts. When South Africans vote Wednesday, an unhappy combination of rampant corruption, soaring joblessness, crippling\u00a0power cuts\u00a0and feeble economic growth will likely be top of mind. The economy has gone backward over the past decade, evidenced by a sharp fall in living standards. According to the\u00a0World Bank, gross domestic product per capita has fallen from a peak in 2011, leaving the average South African 23% poorer. A third of the labor force is unemployed,\u00a0more than in war-torn Sudan, and the highest\u00a0rate\u00a0of any country\u00a0tracked by the World Bank.\u00a0Income inequality is also the world\u2019s worst. There are 18.4 million people on welfare benefits, compared with just\u00a07 million taxpayers, according to Oxford Economics, a consultancy. Black South Africans, who make up 81% of the population, are at the sharp end of this dire situation. Unemployment and poverty remain concentrated in the Black majority, in large part due to the failure of public schooling, while most White South Africans have jobs and command considerably higher wages. Moreover, the government\u2019s flagship policy for driving economic inclusion and racial equality in post-apartheid South Africa \u2014 Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment, known as triple-BEE or simply BEE \u2014 has failed to achieve its aims, with wealth still concentrated in the hands of a few at the expense of the many. \u201cThree decades after the end of apartheid, the economy is defined by stagnation and exclusion, and current strategies are not achieving inclusion and empowerment in practice,\u201d Harvard University concluded in a report published in November by its Growth Lab following two years of research. \u2018Elite enrichment\u2019 Under apartheid \u2014 and colonial rule before that \u2014 Black South Africans were violently oppressed and denied many basic human rights. They were also systematically excluded from owning land, living in certain areas, and accessing a decent education and jobs. The end of White minority rule could not on its own compensate for such extreme and prolonged injustice. Restitution was needed \u2014 and that\u2019s what BEE set out to deliver. There is now almost universal agreement that the policy failed to transform economic reality for the majority of Black and other South Africans who were historically disadvantaged, including Indians and Coloureds, the official term for South Africans with mixed heritage who have a distinct cultural identity. President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has previously described BEE as \u201ca must for (economic) growth,\u201d promised Saturday the ANC would \u201cdo better\u201d if reelected, with a focus on creating more jobs. The Democratic Alliance, the official opposition party, has said it would replace BEE with an \u201cEconomic Justice policy\u201d that \u201ctargets the poor black majority for redress, rather than a small, connected elite.\u201d Critics of BEE argue there has been an overemphasis on increasing Black ownership of established businesses through giant deals that have, in fact, enriched only a handful of politically connected people. This is a view held by Moeletsi Mbeki, brother of former President Thabo Mbeki and chairman of the South African Institute of International Affairs, an independent think tank located at Wits University in Johannesburg. BEE \u201ccreates a class of rich politicians who are then beholden to the people who are making them rich, but it disincentivizes people from becoming entrepreneurs,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cIf I became president, the first thing I would do would be to scrap BEE,\u201d he added. By Moeletsi\u2019s telling, White executives devised BEE as a way to \u201ccoopt ANC leaders\u201d in the early years of democracy\u00a0by giving them shares in companies that they would then be disinclined to nationalize, a\u00a0policy\u00a0many in the party favored. Still, despite tens of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of BEE deals, Black ownership of companies stands\u00a0at just 34% on average, according to the\u00a0latest report\u00a0by the B-BBEE Commission, which monitors adherence to the policy. \u201cInroads are being made on the participation of Black\u00a0people in the economy, although there is much further to go to realise the objectives (of BEE),\u201d Commission head Tshediso Matona told CNN. Black people are also poorly represented in top management, another\u00a0of the policy\u2019s focus areas. According to a recent\u00a0PwC\u00a0report, just 19% of the 200 most valuable companies listed in Johannesburg are led by Black, Coloured, Indian or Asian CEOs. Many companies in the private sector \u201care not implementing the spirit of the (BEE) legislation\u2026 they\u2019re (only) ticking boxes,\u201d said Kganki Matabane, the CEO of the Black Business Council, a lobby group for Black business. \u201cBusinesses cannot continue to exclude the majority, they\u2019ll render the country ungovernable one day,\u201d he added. Matthew Parks, the parliamentary coordinator for the Congress of South African Trade Unions, an umbrella body for labor unions and an ANC partner, says BEE has helped grow South Africa\u2019s Black middle class but that more must be done for workers, particularly those on minimum wages. He also argues that the policy needs more time to bear fruit. \u201cThree decades given to overcome the impact of three centuries (of White oppression) is not enough.\u201d According to Matona, of the Commission, BEE is \u201conly one part of a suite of policy tools to achieve transformation,\u201d which also includes laws around public procurement, competition, employment equity and skills development. \u201cThe overall outcome of economic transformation requires an assessment of all of these policies,\u201d he said. The sharpest criticism of BEE is that it has been corrupted by private interests, leading to severe maladministration in the public sector.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a huge driver of corruption in the country,\u201d said Mbeki. He and other experts who spoke to CNN explained that\u00a0under the auspices of advancing empowerment, politically connected Black people have\u00a0in some instances\u00a0been put\u00a0into\u00a0senior positions in state-owned companies\u00a0despite not having the right qualifications or experience. Similarly,\u00a0some officials have abused\u00a0public procurement rules\u00a0that favor Black-owned businesses,\u00a0awarding\u00a0government contracts at inflated prices to\u00a0underperforming companies\u00a0in exchange for bribes, a phenomenon sometimes referred to\u00a0locally\u00a0as \u201ctenderpreneurship.\u201d Infrastructure collapse \u201cTenderpreneurship\u201d\u00a0has devastated state-owned companies and local governments across the country, said Ricardo Hausmann, the director of Harvard\u2019s Growth Lab, a hub for research on economic growth and development. \u201cPoor implementation of affirmative action in the public sector\u201d has contributed to \u201ccollapsing state capacity,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe poster child of this is the electricity sector.\u201d For much of last year, South Africans were without power for at least some portion of the day. \u201cLoadshedding\u201d \u2014 as it\u2019s known locally \u2014 hit a new record, with power cuts on 335 days, according to state-owned power utility Eskom. The years-long electricity crisis has abated in recent months, but it is not yet\u00a0over. Widespread graft at Eskom and other government institutions, primarily under former President Jacob Zuma, has been a core reason for the collapse of South Africa\u2019s electricity, transport and, latterly,\u00a0water infrastructure, according to Haroon Bhorat, an economics professor at the University of Cape Town. The result has been to cripple economic activity. Economists estimate that GDP growth could be as high as 3%-5.4% this year were it not for crumbling infrastructure. Instead, the International Monetary Fund forecasts a paltry 0.9% expansion. The \u201cultimate effect\u201d of collapsing infrastructure leading to lower economic\u00a0growth rates is \u201ca governing party that is going to struggle to get urban voters to believe it can turn the economy around,\u201d Bhorat added. South Africa\u2019s economy hasn\u2019t always been in dire straits. For the first 15 years of democracy, the ANC \u201cmanaged the economy relatively well,\u201d Bhorat said. Under Thabo Mbeki, public debt fell considerably and the government even recorded small budget surpluses between 2006 and 2008, meaning it spent less than it received in taxes. Economic growth averaged around 4% a year. In contrast, under Zuma, South Africa\u2019s credit rating was downgraded to junk, or sub-investment grade, by S&P and Fitch. GDP growth averaged around 1.5% a year and the debt-to-GDP ratio more than doubled from a post-apartheid low of 24% in 2008, according to the\u00a0IMF. It is now hovering around 75%. While South Africa was far from perfect under Mbeki \u2014 violent crime was high, the country remained extremely unequal and public services, particularly\u00a0education, needed considerable work \u2014 it had a much stronger economic\u00a0foundation on which to tackle its plentiful post-apartheid challenges. It is that foundation that the country must now painstakingly rebuild. A better future for all? One silver lining to South Africa\u2019s economic crisis is a deepening partnership between government and business to meet the moment. Chief executives from more than 130 major South African companies, including the likes of Investec and Discovery, as well as the local leaders of JPMorgan, Shell and Unilever have formed\u00a0an initiative called\u00a0Business for South Africa. The group holds regular meetings with senior government officials, including President Ramaphosa and heads of state-owned companies, and is undertaking targeted interventions in areas including transport infrastructure and electricity. These\u00a0are already yielding positive results and\u00a0could mean that power cuts are banished for good next year,\u00a0according to Cas Coovadia, the CEO of Business Unity South Africa, the country\u2019s main business lobby group. \u201cThis has proven to be real partnership\u2026 we are making progress,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe whole purpose of this intervention is to stop the slide and give us the space to begin to turn this big ship around.\u201d For Hausmann, of the Harvard Growth Lab, the ANC\u2019s waning influence might be just what the party needs. If political power is more contested, it \u201cputs more of the fear of the wrath of the people into government, so they feel the urgency to improve performance,\u201d he said. \u201cIn general, what disciplines governments is the fear of losing elections.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/business/south-africa-election-economy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_business_nissan-suv-driveway-explosion", "text": "In the early morning of May 14, Vicki Hill was startled awake by the sound of explosions outside her home in Bethesda, Maryland. The loud bangs, she learned later, had come from the airbags of the family\u2019s SUV, a 2015 Nissan Murano that was parked in the driveway. It was on fire. \u201cI thought someone was trying to get into our house with a sledgehammer and I woke my husband up and I said something\u2019s wrong,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAnd he ran downstairs and shouted up, \u2018Call 911, the car\u2019s on fire!\u2019\u201d Video from the home\u2019s doorbell camera,\u00a0which the family provided to CNN,\u00a0shows smoke before the fire erupts and then\u00a0engulfs the car. The cause of the fire in the Murano remains unknown. The fire is\u00a0under investigation\u00a0by Nissan. The National Highway Traffic Administration is gathering information\u00a0on the fire, as well. \u201cThe safety and security of our customers is our primary concern,\u201d a Nissan spokesperson said in a statement in response to an email asking about the fire. \u201cWe have opened an investigation into this incident.\u201d The\u00a0Hills\u2019 Murano was recalled by Nissan\u00a0in 2016 and 2019, to fix a problem that could allow brake fluid to leak and start a fire, even while the vehicle is parked. At the time, owners were warned to park their vehicles outside and away from buildings until the issue was repaired because of fire risks. A search on NHTSA\u2019s website indicated there was an outstanding unrepaired recall on the Hills\u2019 Murano. The couple said a local fire investigator suggested the unrepaired recall could have caused the fire. But the Hills remember getting the work done and provided CNN with a photograph of the receipt from a local Nissan dealership that showed the repair was made. CNN has not confirmed whether the receipt is authentic. The Hills said that because the recall work had been done, the possibility of a fire wasn\u2019t something that crossed their minds. Philip Hill had been fixing the garage, so the couple\u2019s two cars were parked in the driveway. Otherwise, the Murano would have been parked inside the garage adjoining the house. \u201cAs you can see from the video, that vehicle is so close to the house,\u201d Philip Hill told CNN. \u201cMinutes later, the house could have gone up.\u201d As it was, the garage door melted from the flames, they said. The Hills credit a neighbor\u2019s dog with saving them and their three children. The neighbor was able to call 911 before the Hills, after being alerted by her dog. The intense flames from the burning Nissan also damaged the side of the family\u2019s other car, a 2012 Mercedes C-class, leaving it unusable. Initially, the Hills were concerned they might have been victims of vandalism. But\u00a0they said\u00a0the video footage from their Nest doorbell camera\u00a0clearly\u00a0showed the vehicle spontaneously combusting. Nissan took possession of the Murano on Wednesday to study it more closely, the Hills said. As surprising as the Hills\u2019 situation may seem, vehicle fires are not uncommon. In 2022, an estimated 188,500 car and truck fires blazed in the United States, an average of more than 500 a day, according to the National Fire Protection Association. Vehicle fires caused 610 civilian deaths that year, according the NFPA.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/business/nissan-suv-driveway-explosion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_economy_us-home-prices-case-shiller-march", "text": "US home prices reached a record high in March, reflecting the housing market\u2019s persistent affordability crisis. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index, a measure of home prices across the country, jumped 6.5% in March from a year earlier to a record high. It is the sixth time the index has reached a new record high over the past year. The report showed that there\u2019s strong demand for housing in urban population centers such as San Diego, New York, Cleveland and Los Angeles. The 20-city index rose in March at a slightly faster pace than in February. \u201cThis month\u2019s report boasts another all-time high,\u201d said Brian Luke, head of commodities, real and digital assets, at S&P Dow Jones Indices. \u201cWe\u2019ve witnessed records repeatedly break in both stock and housing markets over the past year.\u201d In addition to unrelentingly high home prices, the housing market is also grappling with a chronic lack of homes on the market and elevated mortgage rates. Put together, it has resulted in a tough housing market, especially first-time buyers. Persistent challenges, but some slight improvements Housing affordability, which factors in incomes, home prices and mortgage rates, remains in the doldrums. But there have been some steps in the right direction recently. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell below 7% last week, after rates began to surge in mid-April. Still, mortgage rates are higher than anything seen in the decade leading up to 2022. Economists don\u2019t expect mortgage rates to decline meaningfully this year and could very well remain above 6%. That\u2019s because inflation got stuck earlier this year, causing the Federal Reserve to push back the timing of its interest rate cut. The Fed\u2019s key interest rate is currently at its highest level in more than two decades. The central bank doesn\u2019t directly set mortgage rates, but its actions do influence them. Mortgage rates track the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, which moves in anticipation of the Fed\u2019s policy moves. One persistent headache for buyers has been sky-high home prices. Annual home price growth is down from a record high of 20.8% in March 2022, but it has picked up steam in the past several months. Since the spring of 2022, there have only been two months in which homes prices declined. A persistent under-supply of housing is a key factor putting some upward pressure on prices, but there have been some consistent improvements this year. The National Association of Realtors reported last week that total housing inventory at the end of April was 1.21 million units, up 9% from the prior month and 16.3% higher from a year earlier. However, that is nowhere close to keeping up with demand, economists say.

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

In their letter, released Tuesday, Altman and husband Oliver Mulherin credited \u201cthe hard work, brilliance, generosity, and dedication to improve the world of many people that built the scaffolding of society that let us get here.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing we can do except feel immense gratitude and commit to pay it forward, and do what we can to build the scaffolding up a little higher,\u201d the pair added.

He doesn\u2019t have a stake in OpenAI, the tech company that\u2019s at the forefront of artificial intelligence. The Giving Pledge was started in 2010 by billionaires Warren Buffett and the formerly married couple, Bill and Melinda French Gates, to get the world\u2019s wealthiest to commit to donating at least half of their fortunes to charities and philanthropic causes either during their lifetimes or in their wills. The pledge isn\u2019t a legally binding contract, but more of a moral commitment.

{"id": "2024_05_22_business_nvidias-stock-split-earnings-results", "text": "Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split on Wednesday, making buying shares in the red-hot semiconductor company more accessible for individual investors. Five years ago, an investor could have purchased Nvidia stock for less than $50 a share. But since then, the stock has exploded more than 2,500%. A single share in the company was worth $949.50 as of Wednesday\u2019s close. Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) announcement, which came in its quarterly earnings report, means that each common share will be split into 10 smaller shares, effectively cutting the price of investing in the company. The company posted yet another quarter of strong financial results on Wednesday, as well. Nvidia reported a 262% increase in revenue and a 462% increase in profits year-over-year. Nvidia\u2019s post-split shares will begin trading at the market open on June 10, coming at a time when Nvidia\u2019s stock has been on a tear, fueled by investor enthusiasm about the company\u2019s role in artificial intelligence. Nvidia shares rose as much as 4% in after-hours trading following the report. Nvidia is crucial to the burgeoning AI space. The American chipmaker is unmatched in producing processors that power artificial intelligence systems, including for generative AI, the buzzy new technology that can create text, images and other media.  And the company\u2019s soaring stock price over the past year means Nvidia is now deeply important to the broader market, too. The company has become something of a bellwether for the larger AI boom that has been driving the recent market rally. That the company was again able to exceed Wall Street\u2019s predications for its booming sales growth on Wednesday isn\u2019t entirely surprising. Many of the major tech giants, including Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and others, have announced in recent weeks that they\u2019re continuing to pour billions of dollars into building AI infrastructure, and no company is better poised to be the beneficiary of that investment than Nvidia. Still, some investors had raised questions ahead of Wednesday\u2019s report about just how long Nvidia could keep the rally going. The company faces growing competition from in-house AI chips from Amazon and Alphabet, and it has had to contend with US restrictions on exports of advanced AI chips to China. \u201cThere was no secret around Wall Street that Nvidia\u2019s earnings would come in hot once again,\u201d Investing.com senior analyst Thomas Monteiro said in a statement following the report. \u201cWhile the company didn\u2019t repeat the same total blowout from the last few quarters in any specific area, today\u2019s numbers remain incredibly strong, leaving no doubt that the company\u2019s leadership in the AI revolution remains unchallenged for now.\u201d Nvidia said it expects revenue for the current quarter to grow approximately 107% year-over-year, a slight slowdown from the meteoric sales growth the company has posted over the past few quarters as it hits the one-year mark from when the AI boom began to take off.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/business/nvidias-stock-split-earnings-results/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%.

Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important.

{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_tech_china-semiconductor-investment-fund-intl-hnk", "text": "China is doubling down on its plan to\u00a0dominate advanced technologies of the future by setting up its largest-ever semiconductor state investment fund, according to information posted by a government-run agency. Worth $47.5 billion, the fund is being created as the US imposes sweeping restrictions on the export of American chips and chip technology in a bid to throttle Beijing\u2019s ambitions. With investments from six of the country\u2019s largest state-owned banks, including ICBC and China Construction Bank, the fund underscores Chinese leader\u00a0Xi Jinping\u2019s push to bolster China\u2019s position as a tech superpower. With its\u00a0Made in China 2025 road map, Beijing has set a target for China to become a global leader in a wide range of industries, including artificial intelligence (AI), 5G wireless, and quantum computing. The latest investment vehicle is the third phase of the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund. The \u201cBig Fund,\u201d as it is known, was officially established in Beijing on Friday, according to the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System. Shares of top Chinese chipmakers have jumped after the news. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), the world\u2019s third largest contract chipmaker, has rallied 7% since Monday. Hua Hong Semiconductor, China\u2019s second largest chip foundry and a supplier for Huawei, has gained 13%. The first phase of the fund was set up in 2014 with 138.7 billion yuan ($19.2 billion). The second phase was established five years later, with a registered capital of 204.1 billion yuan ($28.2 billion). The investments aim to bring the country\u2019s semiconductor industry up to international standards by 2030 and will pump money primarily into chip manufacturing, design, equipment and materials, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said when launching the first phase in 2014. Roadblocks ahead? The \u201cBig Fund\u201d has been hit by corruption scandals in recent years. In 2022, the country\u2019s anti-graft watchdog launched a crackdown on the semiconductor industry, investigating some of China\u2019s top figures in state-owned chip companies. Lu Jun, former chief executive of Sino IC Capital, which managed the \u201cBig Fund,\u201d was probed and indicted on bribery charges in March, according to a statement by the country\u2019s top prosecutor. These scandals aren\u2019t the only roadblocks that could severely undermined Xi\u2019s ambitions to get China to achieve tech self-reliance. In October 2022, the US unveiled a sweeping set of export controls that ban Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and chip-making equipment without a license.\u00a0The Biden administration has also pressed its allies, including Netherlands and Japan, to enact their own restrictions. Beijing hit back last year by imposing export controls on two strategic raw materials that are critical to the global chipmaking industry. The new chip fund is not only a defensive move to counter Western sanctions, but also part of Xi\u2019s long-held ambitions to make China a global leader in technology. Last year, China\u2019s Huawei shocked industry experts by introducing a new smartphone powered by a 7-nanometer processor made by SMIC. At the time of the Huawei phone launch, analysts could not understand how the company would have the technology to make such a chip following sweeping efforts by the United States to restrict China\u2019s access to foreign technology. In a meeting with the Dutch Prime Minister\u00a0Mark Rutte in March, Xi said that \u201cno force can stop China\u2019s scientific and technological development.\u201d The Netherlands is home to ASML, the world\u2019s sole manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography machines needed to make advanced semiconductors. The company said in January that it had been\u00a0prohibited\u00a0by the Dutch government from shipping some of its lithography machines to China.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/tech/china-semiconductor-investment-fund-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_business_summer-box-office-memorial-day", "text": "The summer movie season typically starts with a bang during the month of May and, particularly, during Memorial Day weekend. This year, it\u2019s a whimper. Memorial Day weekend (Friday through Monday) movie ticket sales are estimated at $128.3 million, according to Comscore data provided to CNN. That\u2019s down from last year\u2019s Memorial Day weekend, which recorded just shy of $205 million gross revenue, and it lands well under the record holiday in 2013, when \u201cFast & Furious 6\u201d drove the weekend to $314.3 million in revenue. In fact, the US box office is on track to have its lowest-grossing Memorial Day weekend since the $117.1 million seen in 1995, when \u201cCasper\u201d haunted the screens \u2014 and that\u2019s not even adjusting for inflation. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to sugarcoat it, the numbers that are coming out this weekend are nothing to write home about,\u201d Paul Degarabedian, senior media analyst with Comscore, told CNN in an interview. \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d was estimated to be the No. 1 movie with $32 million in sales for the weekend. The tepid Memorial Day weekend continues what\u2019s been a lukewarm start to the summer box office, a movie-going season that\u2019s still reeling from the effects of last year\u2019s Hollywood strikes. Coupled with production delays \u2014 the aftershocks of the multi-month-long Writers Guild and SAG-AFTRA strikes that are still reverberating across studios \u2014 the season that has historically drawn the biggest movie theater audiences is off to a rocky start, potentially hurting the yearly box office totals for 2024. \u201cSummer is the most important moviegoing season of the year, accounting on average for nearly 40% of the total domestic annual revenue, so as goes the summer so goes the year,\u201d Dergarabedian said. Last\u00a0summer, blockbusters \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d\u00a0combined added nearly a billion dollars to the domestic box office, according to Comscore data. But this year, studios are betting on a large slate of mid-range sequels and prequels, as well as family-focused animated films to fill the Barbenheimer-shaped hole, including \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga,\u201d \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2.\u201d \u201cBarring some major overperformances, this summer looks like it\u2019ll be down 20% to 25% in box office grosses between May and August from last year,\u201d said analyst Shawn Robbins, founder and owner of Box Office Theory. While there was no Marvel movie to kick off this May and no mega-blockbuster for Memorial Day, there\u2019s still potentially a solid pipeline of movies to come this year, Degarabarian said. \u201cWe just now have to count on the films coming out in June and July to really perform \u2014 and there\u2019s some big ones on the horizon,\u201d he said, noting \u201cDespicable Me 4,\u201d \u201cInside-Out 2,\u201d and \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine.\u201d The elusive $100-million opening weekend Until 2020, the period between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day Monday could be counted on to bring in upwards of $4 billion in domestic revenue, according to Comscore data. Summer 2023 saw the first post-pandemic $4-billion summer. Propelled by the success of \u201cSound of Freedom,\u201d \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d and the record-breaking $155 million \u201cBarbie\u201d opening weekend, summer 2023 grossed $4.09 billion, a 19.2% jump from the year prior. \u201cBarbie\u201d was distributed by Warner Bros., which is owned by CNN\u2019s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery. An opening weekend north of $100 million is typically only seen in intellectual property-driven action films like Star Wars movies and superhero flicks, as well as animated family fare like \u201cThe Incredibles 2\u201d and \u201cFinding Dory.\u201d So far this year, no movie has crossed that threshold. \u201cSans a Marvel movie to provide a $100-million-plus opening weekend to get the momentum going, this summer will have to make up ground in June and July,\u201d said Dergarabedian, adding that this summer has so far been a \u201clate bloomer.\u201d Disney offerings could make or break the summer box office Two movies that analysts say could cross the $100 million threshold this summer are \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d both of which are distributed by Walt Disney Studios. The studio\u2019s first wide release of 2024 under its flagship \u201cDisney\u201d banner is set to be \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d an anomaly for the company and the movie business, according to Daniel Loria, editorial director at Box Office Pro, which collects sales and showtimes data from thousands of movie theaters across the United States. (Disney-owned 20th Century Entertainment released its first movie of the year, \u201cThe First Omen,\u201d in April.) \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other year where a studio as vital to this industry sits out the entire first half of the year,\u201d Loria told CNN, adding that this is in large part due to production delays and schedule shifts caused by months of back and forth between studios, the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, the actors\u2019 union. \u201cWe tend to overemphasize the effect of Hollywood\u2019s 2023 labor strikes at the box office, but it\u2019s hard not to cite it when you look at the number of releases to have hit theaters from major studios in the first half of the year.\u201d Disney has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Loria also emphasized that Disney\u2019s summer offerings, both from its Pixar and Marvel divisions, will be critical to how the 2024 box office performs overall. \u201cInside Out 2\u201d is forecast to open anywhere between $80 million and $100 million, according to Box Office Pro pre-sales data. Pixar\u2019s offerings in recent years have fallen flat; 2022\u2019s \u201cLightyear\u201d debuted at $50.5 million domestically, while 2023\u2019s \u201cElemental\u201d made $29.6 million its opening weekend. Meanwhile, \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d the only Marvel property release this summer, is expected to reinvigorate audience enthusiasm after \u201cThe Marvels\u201d disappointed last November with a $47 million opening weekend. Last week, ticket seller Fandango announced that \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d had broken the company\u2019s 2024 record for best first-day ticket presales, beating out \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d The film also had the best first day of ticket sales for an R-rated film in Fandango\u2019s 24-year history, the company told CNN. \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine has the potential to be the second movie (after 2021\u2019s \u201cSpiderman: No Way Home\u201d) to earn a $200 million opening weekend of the post-pandemic era,\u201d said Loria. \u201cWe are still two months out, but if pre-sales and awareness continue at this pace, we believe the film can open between $170 million and $210 million.\u201d \u201cDespicable Me 4\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2\u201d \u201clook particularly strong, and \u2018Deadpool & Wolverine\u2019 will hands down be the top film of the summer,\u201d said Dergarabedian. Studios still trying to find their footing Industry experts agree that the 2024 box office has been sluggish so far, but remain hopeful that the box office can rebound by the end of the year and beyond. \u201cBox office earnings have been down largely because of staggered gaps between widely appealing releases in the first half of the year,\u201d said Robbins. \u201cThat\u2019s been the status quo in the post-pandemic era for many reasons, mostly outside the control of theatrical exhibition. The industry had only a brief period between the impact of COVID production delays followed by the writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strikes last year.\u201d Robbins added that there\u2019s still time for strong titles in the second half of the year to fill the gap, including September\u2019s \u201cBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\u201d and \u201cTransformers One,\u201d and October\u2019s \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.\u201d \u201cMoviegoing habits have changed drastically since the\u00a0pandemic, but we continue to see significant enthusiasm when it comes to the theatrical experience,\u201d said Loria. \u201cThe data clearly shows that audiences can still support the studio tentpole model \u2014 but identifying the movies that will become those blockbuster hits continues to be as difficult to predict as ever before.\u201d Box Office Pro projects that the 2024 box office will gross $8.2 billion, about 10% lower than last year\u2019s $9 billion. The domestic earnings for 2023 were the highest since the pandemic, but still fell roughly $2 billion short of pre-pandemic yearly sales, according to Comscore.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/business/summer-box-office-memorial-day/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

I want to help even the match.\u201d French Gates, one of the world\u2019s wealthiest and most prominent philanthropists, resigned from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation earlier this month, announcing June 7 will be her last day at the organization she helped create more than two decades ago. As part of her divorce agreement, she received $12.5 billion from the Gates Foundation for her work upon her resignation, and she hinted she would focus her philanthropic efforts on women and girls \u2014 but she offered no specifics. Tuesday, she gave the first details of her new plan. French Gates said she will donate $1 billion through 2026 to advance women\u2019s rights around the world\u00a0through her organization, Pivotal Ventures. That will include $200 million in grants to organizations that are fighting for women\u2019s reproductive rights. Among those recipients is The 19th, a nonprofit news organization that reports on gender policy. \u201cPinch me,\u201d Emily Ramshaw, the company\u2019s co-founder and CEO, said in a post on X. \u201cSometimes dreams do come true,\u201d Ramshaw said in a blog post on the company\u2019s website. \u201cThis support will bolster our critical politics and policy coverage in a seismic election year, allow us to make strategic investments in our audiences and our future, and lay the foundation for our long-term sustainability in a turbulent time for our industry.\u201d Another recipient, The Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, said its grant will help advance its work to improve women\u2019s health across the United States and narrow the gender pay gap. \u201cWe are deeply honored to receive this support from Melinda French Gates, a true pioneer for women\u2019s empowerment,\u201d said Dr. Jamila Taylor, IWPR President and CEO, in a statement. French Gates will also give $250 million in awards to organizations working to help improve women\u2019s mental and physical health. In an innovative effort that echoes those by mega-philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, French Gates also said she will grant $240 million to a group of 12 advocates and influential leaders around the world ($20 million each) to allow them to give the money to groups they believe are performing urgent and meaningful work in women\u2019s health. Scott has shaken up the charitable world by shelling out large sums of money at rapid speed to organizations she favors \u2014 with no demands or strings attached. \u201cI\u2019m also experimenting with novel tactics to bring a wider range of perspectives into philanthropy,\u201d French Gates wrote in her op-ed. \u201cI\u2019m eager to see the landscape of funding opportunities through their eyes, and the results their approaches unlock.\u201d French Gates said the group of leaders includes former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, maternal-health advocate Allyson Felix and Afghan women\u2019s education activist Shabana Basij-Rasikh.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

The fiasco led lawmakers to grill a top executive of Ticketmaster\u2019s parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, in January last year over the company\u2019s practices.

{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_26_business_tennis-popularity-zendaya-challengers", "text": "It\u2019s not Zendaya\u2019s fault you can\u2019t stop thinking about tennis. Her magnetic performance in \u201cChallengers,\u201d a movie about a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois that happens to have tennis in the background, might seem to have thrust the sport into the spotlight, but it\u2019s becoming more popular in the past few years that it\u2019s hard to escape. The sport is surging on a global scale, with its biggest names fronting luxe fashion campaigns from Louis Vuitton to Loewe and stars gracing the cover of Vogue. Of course, there\u2019s a TikTok angle, with the rise of #tenniscore videos garnering tens of millions of views, and yes, even that buzzy film, which was number one at the box office in its debut weekend. In a world of megawatt sports stars, ESPN went with tennis and chose 23-time grand slam winner Serena Williams to host this year\u2019s ESPY Awards, airing on ABC in July, perhaps as a testament that the sport is actually a draw again. Tennis had its heydey in the 1970s and 80s but a resurgence began at the height of Covid-19 when it was one of the few activities people could play safely while socially distanced. Its popularity has only grown since, as there\u2019s a changing of the guard among the top-ranked players that it\u2019s attracting new eyes and corporate interests, like fashion and Hollywood, fueling a boon. Not only are people just watching it, they\u2019re actually hitting the courts: The United States Tennis Association (USTA) said that nearly 24 million people are currently playing tennis, marking four consecutive years of growth. Brands are serving The money is following: In the past year, the number of sponsorships jumped 41% and the number of brands advertising in tennis soared 40%, according to SponsorUnited, a sports and entertainment research platform,\u00a0growing faster than many other sports including MLB, MLS and the NBA. That\u2019s the result of a \u201cconvergence of a few important factors,\u201d according to Bob Lynch, CEO of SponsorUnited, including rising TV ratings for the Tennis Channel and major tournaments, the docuseries \u201cBreak Point\u201d that had a two-season run on Netflix plus the growth of tennis players\u2019 social media accounts. Tennis is one the rare sports that plays nearly year-round with weekly tournaments across the world, so it \u201cattracts a diverse, global and localized fan base, which gives brands the ability to target very specific audiences for specific reasons,\u201d Lynch told CNN. Want to promote Swiss tourism around the world? The country tapped its greatest tennis export Roger Federer to star in a campaign for just that, with one viral ad starring Anne Hathaway that garnered more than 100 million views on YouTube. Or want to advertise to an affluent audience? That explains all the banking logos surrounding the courts at Roland Garros in Paris. Tennis is also going through a change of guard, especially on the men\u2019s side with Rafael Nadal likely playing his final season and Novak Djokovic, who is still the world\u2019s no. 1 men\u2019s player, lately struggling. Popular players on the woman\u2019s tour such as the Williams sisters have either retired, struggled with injuries or have taken a maternity leave such as former no. 1 Naomi Osaka. That\u2019s prompted an opening for many players, especially younger ones, including 2023 Wimbledon winner Carlos Alcaraz, who is just 21 years old, and Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, the 22-year-old from Poland who has already won four grand slam titles, to become global superstars. \u201cDigitally native and content savvy younger players like Coco Gauff are becoming more prominent,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cFans have more access to tennis athletes and their lives, interests and journeys than ever before due to the increased social exposure they receive, which allows them to become more influential to fans and brands alike.\u201d A scroll through Gauff\u2019s Instagram page, where the 2023 US Open women\u2019s final winner has nearly 2 million followers, shows her various sponsors mixed with photos from her personal life. Posts on her feed range from Barilla (the pasta maker signed her in 2019 to include its logo on her clothing), to speaking about how technology helps her practice in a Microsoft ad. How players cash in Another brand featured heavily on Gauff\u2019s Instagram is New Balance, her official on-court outfitter that signed her when she was just 14 years old, which has since expanded to include a lineup of shoes that the 20-year-old helps design. When Gauff won her first Grand Slam title last year, not only was she wearing a New Balance outfit designed for the US Open, but after winning, she donned a \u201cCall Me Coco Champion\u201d T-shirt that sold out within a few hours. Although she\u2019s the brand\u2019s biggest player, she\u2019s also part of a select few athletes that the privately owned apparel maker has deals with, trailing bigger outfitters such as Nike and Adidas. \u201cWe say no a lot,\u201d admits Evan Zeder, director of global sports marketing for New Balance\u2019s tennis and baseball units. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking to just sign a bunch of athletes to have a bunch of athletes.\u201d Its players, which also includes no. 14 men\u2019s player Tommy Paul, get various forms of payment including retainers and bonuses from New Balance and clothes and footwear to wear on and off the court. Tennis is different because the athlete is wearing the brand head to toe and is the center of attention since it\u2019s largely a solo sport. Choosing a tennis player to sponsor takes trust on both sides, with New Balance having to prove that its clothes and shoes perform \u201con the highest levels of the sport\u201d and avoid a public relations nightmare currently happening in baseball, but it\u2019s \u201cultimately waiting for the right opportunities for the brand,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe opportunity for us to story tell with the athletes is more unique than any other sport out there because they\u2019re not wearing a team or jersey, they\u2019re wearing New Balance,\u201d he said. Fashion on the forefront While New Balance is a relatively new clothier to enter the sport, others have been involved for decades. Lacoste, the French luxury brand, was born with tennis in mind since its start in 1933. After all, founder Ren\u00e9 Lacoste created the \u201cpolo shirt\u201d that was made for tennis. \u201cLacoste\u00a0undoubtedly benefits from the greatest legitimacy in this universe thanks to its sporting roots, particularly in tennis,\u201d said Lacoste\u2019s Deputy CEO Catherine Spindler. The crocodile-adorned brand has two of the biggest names in tennis who faced off against each other in the 2023 US Open men\u2019s final: Djokovic and Daniil Medvedev, with the former easily winning. Lacoste\u2019s polo shirts have become a major part of the \u201ctennis aesthetic,\u201d or the luxury athleticism #tenniscore trending on social media. That\u2019s perhaps not a surprise to Spindler because the sport \u201chas always been associated with elegance, including from a sartorial point of view.\u201d \u201cRecently, the influence of tennis on fashion has strengthened even further, and many are adopting the codes of this sport,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cPieces from the tennis universe are highly praised and serve as sources of inspiration for everyone.\u201d Zendaya recently wore a custom-made Lacoste silhouette ensemble for her \u201cChallengers\u201d press stop in Australia, which is \u201cfurther proof of the inspiration generated by tennis,\u201d Spindler said. Big business for booze Tennis has not only raised the profile for clothing, but it\u2019s a magnet for premium spirit brands too. The Australian Open serves up the Aperol Spritz. Roland Garros in Paris, which starts Sunday, has its Mo\u00ebt & Chandon champagne and no visit to Wimbledon, near London, is complete without a Pimm\u2019s. However, arguably the most popular cocktail in tennis is at the US Open: the Honey Deuce. The $22 drink mixes Grey Goose vodka, lemonade and Chambord and is topped with a honeydew melon ball. In 2023, a record-breaking 450,000 of these drinks were sold. Alcohol brands trying to crack the US market see the growing popularity of tennis as an opportunity to introduce themselves to drinkers. Take Maestro Dobel, a tequila brand sold in the US since 2008 but overshadowed by its celebrity-backed competitors. Dobel became the US Open\u2019s official tequila sponsor last year, bringing alongs its Ace Paloma cocktail that it sells at other tennis tournaments it sponsors. But the brand\u2019s attraction to tennis \u201cwasn\u2019t something that happened overnight,\u201d said Lander Otegui, the chief marketing officer for Proximo, noting that the brand has sponsored tournaments in Mexico for more than a decade. Dobel, in recent years, expanded north to become sponsors of elite-level tournaments in Miami, Indian Wells and Cincinnati \u2014 all places where Otegui said Dobel sees an \u201cuptick\u201d in sales following the tournament. The fans that tennis attracts are \u201cpretty wide\u201d in regards to ages but the affluent audience that frequent the events \u201cgoes hand-and-hand with the brand,\u201d Otegui said. Otegui declined to reveal specific financial numbers on sponsoring a tournament, but said it\u2019s a \u201cmulti-million dollar investment\u201d that involves paying a hefty fee and additional money for displays and, at the US Open, a starry suite. Last year, it had a suite at Arthur Ashe Stadium, the US Open\u2019s biggest court, where it attracted A-list stars like Charlize Theron and Katie Holmes, which in return, gave the brand even more publicity. \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible time for tennis in the last few years, and with record attendance\u00a0for pretty much every event in the US and globally,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sport is in a really good place and it\u2019s also helped us solidify\u00a0our presence in it.\u201d As for the future, growth won\u2019t fault if the USTA has its way: The organization wants to grow the number of people playing to 35 million, or 10% of the US population, within the next decade.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/business/tennis-popularity-zendaya-challengers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

Or it\u2019s the word of the summer among investors, at least. From analyst notes to earnings calls to CNN\u2019s own stories, the term, which describes the idea of something being divided into two branches or parts, is turning up everywhere. That\u2019s because analysts think it describes the strange economic climate in the United States right now. People at the top end of the income scale are still opening their wallets for dinners out, movies, vacations and big-ticket luxury items. But Federal Reserve data shows that 80% of American households have less cash available to spend now versus 2019. Those who are earning less are feeling the brunt of that. In short: The wealthiest are keeping the economy chugging for now, but fuel is running low. At the same time, markets have been showing their own bifurcation: Mega stocks like Nvidia surge ahead while small caps get left behind. Frothy markets are usually seen as bad omens by investors. Before the Bell spoke with Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo, about the word of the moment and what it means for the economy and markets going forward. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Before the Bell: Last week was a strange one for markets. What\u2019s going on? Scott Wren: It was a weird week because so much economic data came in better than expected. I think we\u2019re in a very sensitive timeframe where what\u2019s good for the economy is bad for the market because of Fed implications. I\u2019ve been around a long time, almost 40 years, and there aren\u2019t too many times you\u2019re going to see rate increases of this (previous) magnitude out of the Fed where you don\u2019t have a recession. While I think that the Fed did a terrible job by leaving rates too low for too long, I think that they\u2019ve done a pretty good job here. The way that they can keep doing a good job is to not cut rates too early. We\u2019ve got two rate cuts priced in for this year and then one for next year. We think you\u2019re going to see inflation fall below 3% in the late summer, early fall, and that will give the Fed an opportunity to cut. But I think that the narrative that good economic news isn\u2019t necessarily good for the market is in play for now. It just all comes down to inflation, and while the top 20% of Americans on the income scale are spending money like it\u2019s going out of style, there are a lot of people in the lower tiers that are struggling. Consumer sentiment might crawl a little bit higher like it did on Friday, but over the next six months I can\u2019t see confidence improving all that much. You mention this stratification \u2014 often referred to as bifurcation. Bifurcation seems to be the buzzword of the summer. I hate that word, but I use it, too. It\u2019s a word that the market gets hung up on and then all you do is hear that word. But it is true. You\u2019ve got the top tier of wage earners versus the lower tier, you\u2019ve also got large cap stocks just killing small caps. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening now, and so bifurcation is the word we\u2019re stuck with. Why is this inequality among consumers catching analysts\u2019 attention now?\u00a0 Our economists tell me that over the last couple of years in particular, discretionary spending is really skewed toward the top end of the income scale. But our economists say that the discretionary spending at the top is not going to be able to keep pushing the economy along to the extent that it has. People that are in the lower tiers of the income scale have been tapping into their 401(k)s and their home equity lines, they\u2019ve been using credit cards. But I think that\u2019s nearing an end, and so I would expect a slowdown in consumer spending. Even at the top, consumers are being a little bit more picky. I certainly think that we\u2019re going to edge up over 4% in terms of the unemployment rate. I think we\u2019re going to get a little bit of backup here in the pace of consumer spending, even on services. Have you seen a split between high-income and lower-income consumers like this before? What\u2019s happened? Usually it ends in recession. It\u2019s just like in stocks: Usually when you come into a big top in the market, it\u2019s a handful of really big cap growth stocks that carry you there. That\u2019s the way it is with consumers, where the big spenders at the top of the wage tier carry us into a strong economy. But I think one difference that we probably underestimated was the magnitude of the effect of all this fiscal deficit spending that the government\u2019s doing. That\u2019s kept the economy going along.\u00a0Just look around, so many airports are under construction, there\u2019s road construction all over the place. Those are high paying jobs, and we know that Americans with money in their pocket, they\u2019re going to spend it. Two years ago, we thought there was going to be a recession. Clearly, there hasn\u2019t been, but there is going to be more of a slowdown going on in the economy. I think typically it would end in recession, but with all this deficit spending that\u2019s going on it looks like it\u2019s just going to end in a slowdown. Tell me more about the bifurcation you see in markets. If I think back over the last six or eight cycles, when you\u2019re coming out of a slowdown or a recession, about halfway through the slowdown, small caps start to outperform. It\u2019s really reliable that they outperform during the first couple of years of the new cycle. I\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s going to happen this time because their balance sheets and cash flows aren\u2019t as strong. They need credit, and credit is tougher to get and it\u2019s more expensive. I think at some point, you know, let\u2019s say in the second half of 2025 when the global economy is likely to be better, we\u2019re probably seeing a little bit of better growth for small caps here in the US, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to be to the extent that they have grown in past cycles. As I look ahead over the next three to six months, it\u2019s hard for me to envision small cap stocks starting to gain ground on large caps. Elon Musk\u2019s xAI firm valued at $24 billion as investors pledge more money The AI firm founded by Elon Musk has raised another $6 billion from investors, including Silicon Valley venture capitalists and a Saudi prince, boosting its valuation to $24 billion, reports my colleague Anna Cooban. Investors providing the second-round funding included Sequoia Capital, Andreesen Horowitz, and Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, xAI announced in a\u00a0blog post\u00a0on Sunday. Musk, who founded xAI in July last year, wrote Monday\u00a0on X\u00a0that there would be \u201cmore to announce in the coming weeks,\u201d and that the startup had a valuation of $18 billion before receiving the new funding. xAI said in its post that the new money would be used to take the firm\u2019s \u201cfirst products to market, build advanced infrastructure, and accelerate the research and development of future technologies.\u201d The funding sets the company up as a potential rival to OpenAI, the AI research group behind the wildly popular chatbot ChatGPT. Musk is a co-founder of OpenAI, but\u00a0stepped down\u00a0as chairman six years ago partly over disagreements about the co\ufeffmpany\u2019s direction. In November, xAI announced that it was developing an\u00a0AI-powered chatbot\u00a0called \u201cGrok\u201d for some paying users of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter which Musk also owns. The billionaire said in a\u00a0post on X\u00a0at the time that Grok was being trained by having \u201creal-time access\u201d to information on the site. China is pumping another $47.5 billion into its chip industry China is doubling down on\u00a0its plan\u00a0to\u00a0dominate\u00a0advanced technologies of the future by setting up its largest-ever semiconductor state investment fund, according to information posted by a government-run agency. Worth $47.5 billion, the fund is being created as the US imposes sweeping restrictions on the export of American chips and chip technology\u00a0in a bid to\u00a0throttle Beijing\u2019s ambitions., reports my colleague Laura He. With investments from six of the country\u2019s largest state-owned banks, including ICBC and China Construction Bank, the fund underscores Chinese leader\u00a0Xi Jinping\u2019s push to bolster China\u2019s position as a tech superpower. With its\u00a0Made in China 2025\u00a0road map, Beijing has set a target for China to become a global leader in a wide range of industries, including artificial intelligence (AI), 5G wireless, and quantum computing. The latest investment vehicle\u00a0is the third phase of the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund. The \u201cBig Fund,\u201d as it is known, was officially established in Beijing on Friday, according to the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_22_economy_fed-minutes-wall-street-inflation", "text": "Earlier this week, some officials at the Federal Reserve said they\u2019re no longer worried about inflation reaccelerating, after data showed that progress stalled in the first quarter. Optimism spurred by the latest inflation data pushed all three major stock indexes to new record highs. But now Wall Street, eager for rate cuts, is on edge again. That\u2019s because minutes from the central bank\u2019s latest policy meeting released Wednesday showed that \u201cvarious\u201d officials said they would be willing to raise interest rates if necessary and that there were doubts as to whether financial conditions are restrictive enough to keep inflation from resurging. It spooked investors: The Dow slid more than 300 points following the release of the minutes. Moreover, the Fed minutes seemed to outweigh comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller, a key messenger of monetary policy moves, who told CNBC in an interview Tuesday that the Fed could cut rates by the \u201cend of the year.\u201d In a separate speech earlier that day, he said \u201cthe data suggests that inflation isn\u2019t accelerating.\u201d \u201cMore recent data on the economy indicate that restrictive monetary policy is helping to cool off aggregate demand and the inflation data for April suggests that progress toward 2% has likely resumed,\u201d Waller said at an event hosted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He pointed to recent figures on employment and retail spending coming in weaker than expected, both of which should help take some steam out of inflation. But some financial leaders remain doubtful that the Fed is feeling confident enough to cut rates soon. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said Wednesday at an event hosted by Boston College that the Fed probably won\u2019t begin to cut rates this year. \u201cI\u2019m still at zero cuts,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re set up for stickier inflation.\u201d Some Fed officials say another rate hike isn\u2019t likely Fed officials have mostly sounded a little more optimistic about inflation recently, after the Consumer Price Index for April finally provided some welcome news. The inflation report was mostly in line with expectations, which was an improvement from the disappointing figures for the first three months of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to focus too much on just one data point,\u201d said Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson at an event hosted by the Mortgage Bankers Association on Monday. However, he noted that the April CPI data was nonetheless \u201ca good sign for us.\u201d San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told Axios in an interview that published Monday that she doesn\u2019t \u201csee any evidence right now that we need to adjust upwards.\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month that it may just be a matter of giving high interest rates some time to kick in. \u201cWhat that has told us is that we\u2019ll need to be patient and let restrictive policy do its work,\u201d he said during a moderated discussion with European Central Bank Governing Council member Klaas Knot. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester told Bloomberg on Monday that she also thinks interest rates are high enough to deal with inflation. But despite the hopeful Fedspeak on inflation, there is still an uneasiness in the air about what\u2019s really happening and what the central bank will do. \u201cFor now, the Fed says it wants to see more evidence that inflation is easing, which implies higher-for-longer rates until that data materializes,\u201d wrote Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing for E*TRADE in a note Wednesday. \u201cTraders will have to wait until next week\u2019s PCE price index to get another read on inflation and update their expectations for rate cuts,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_05_28_tech_ai-iphone", "text": "Imagine asking Apple\u2019s Siri to show you an old photo taken from a child\u2019s second birthday, or summarizing lengthy emails and writing drafts. Then consider Siri learning your schedule, preferences, even your personality, so it can better communicate with you throughout the day. Generative AI, artificial intelligence that can provide thoughtful and thorough responses to questions and prompts, could potentially breathe new life into Apple\u2019s iPhone lineup at a time when competitors are threatening to leave the company behind in the race to shape what could be a world-changing technology. The company is widely expected to partner with ChatGPT maker OpenAI ahead of its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June, where it will likely show off its first batch of AI tools coming to the iOS software. Although artificial intelligence has powered some of the iPhone\u2019s experiences for years, such as Live Text and improved autocorrect, generative AI could unlock new levels of interaction and personalization. All this during a time when the company is under pressure to catch up to rivals such as Google and Samsung, which are already using the technology in its smartphones. \u201cWe see generative AI as a key opportunity across our products and believe we have advantages that set us apart there,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the company\u2019s most recent earnings call in early May, noting there would be news announced in the \u201cweeks ahead.\u201d Apple is not always first to adopt to emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect them for years before including them in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the most cutting-edge technology. The debut of an AI iPhone could also entice consumers to upgrade at a time when they\u2019ve been holding onto older models longer. Apple reported first-quarter revenue of $90.8 billion, down 4% year over year, as the tech giant continues to struggle with growth challenges, particularly in China, amid an uncertain economic environment. Now all eyes shift to Apple for its take on generative AI. Here\u2019s how that could play out on the iPhone: A much smarter assissant Although it\u2019s unclear what exactly an iPhone in the generative AI world would look like, experts largely believe the biggest entrypoint is through Siri, the company\u2019s virtual assistant with a hit-or-miss track record. Integration with OpenAI\u2019s latest ChatGPT-4o model could catapult Siri years forward, essentially turning the feature into an iPhone chatbot. This would enable Siri to perform specific tasks such as recalling a picture taken years ago on the device or answering detailed questions about the weather, the news or trivia. Over time, it could learn the user\u2019s preferences and even personality, and respond accordingly. Looking at how competitors have already introduced generative tools, the iPhone will also likely assist users with other tasks, such as offering to summarize and draft emails, or starting an online purchase return process. Samsung\u2019s \u201ccircle to search\u201d feature, which allows users to quickly search for information on a device\u2019s screen with a finger gesture, has received a lot of attention and is featured in marketing campaigns. Multimodal features \u2013 which refers to an AI system that can interpret and generate different types of data, such as text and images at the same time \u2014 like analysis of video footage and in-call spam detection could also form part of the tools, according to Paul Schell, industry analyst at tech intelligence firm ABI Research. \u201cSomething similar would likely be included in an Apple offering, given its relative simplicity and appeal that goes beyond simple image search,\u201d Schell said. \u201cBut verbal interactions with a bot like Siri will be much more natural and fluent, and its capabilities will go far beyond the previous, narrow domains, like news and weather updates.\u201d An AI iPhone could also adapt automatically and seamlessly to users, based on voice, audio and natural language, along with images and contextual cues. \u201cGenerative AI will allow the next generations of iPhones to become a sixth sense, empowering us to scan and interact with the world around us,\u201d said Thomas Husson, an analyst with market research firm Forrester. Generative AI will also likely change Apple\u2019s whole ecosystem by embedding it through its own apps, such as Apple Maps, iMovie and iPhoto, and release tools for developers for brands to develop new experiences through their own apps. Expediting AI Behind the scenes, Apple reportedly has been working on its on-device generative AI capabilities and acquiring companies for awhile, such as Canadian startup DarwinAI. It also has a machine learning research division dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence.  But after the launch of ChatGPT ignited an AI arms race in late 2022, followed by companies such as Google, Microsoft and Meta heavily pouring resources into developing related tools, Apple has remained relatively quiet about its visions for an AI-powered future. Nabila Popal, a senior research director at market research firm IDC, said the pressure to be part of the conversation likely moved up the company\u2019s timeline. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported Apple was closing in on a deal with OpenAI to use its ChatGPT technology on iPhones, after holding similar talks with Google. \u201cApple normally takes their time and doesn\u2019t let the Android race rush [impact its moves], be it with foldables or 5G or even augmented and virtual reality,\u201d Popal said. \u201cAnd Apple then comes out and does it better than anyone else.\u201d \u201cHowever this time, with AI, it is different,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like Apple is being forced to show its hand early.\u201d She said consumers are considering AI capabilities of greater importance than any other feature when choosing their premium device, especially in China, where Apple is losing its marketshare. \u201cIt\u2019s not just because of the resurgence of Huawei but also because of \u2018lack of AI\u2019 in their devices,\u201d she said. \u201cChinese consumers want more from their premium phones.\u201d During its most recent iPad event, Apple reminded onlookers that it\u2019s been using artificial intelligence in its products for years, including a neural processing engine to support its A11 bionic chip. But now it needs to show it\u2019s going all in on artificial intelligence to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving industry. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a question about whether or not Apple will announce something around generative AI, but Apple has to if they want to achieve growth in this highly competitive and innovative smartphone market, especially in China. \u2026 AI is one train Apple can\u2019t afford to miss.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/tech/ai-iphone/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

Passenger traffic at US airports is on pace to make this Memorial Day weekend the busiest on record, according to Transportation Security Administration screening data. Following record-setting traveler data for Friday (2.951 million, No. 1 screening day in TSA history) and Thursday (2.897 million, No. 3 ever), more than 2.4 million people passed through TSA checkpoints on each day this weekend. What\u2019s amounting to be a blockbuster Memorial Day weekend could be a precursor to a chart-busting summer of travel. It\u2019s also amounting to a frustrating weekend for many travelers. There have been more than 5,000 flight delays and more than 430 cancelations within, into or out of the United States so far on Monday, according to FlightAware data. The number of flight cancellations is now tracking above the average for last year. Five of the top 10 busiest travel days in the TSA\u2019s 22-year history have occurred in the past two weeks alone. \u201cDuring the\u00a0four-day Memorial Day weekend in 2019, approximately 9.5 million passengers were screened; In 2023, that number rose just above 9.8 million,\u201d Regina Boateng, a TSA spokesperson, told CNN via email. \u201cThis year, we expect the four-day\u00a0figure to rise well above 10 million.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to compare holidays, as some fall on varying days of the week.\u00a0However, TSA expects this summer to also be the busiest in the agency\u2019s history.\u201d Three-plus years of high inflation have\u00a0taken their toll\u00a0on Americans\u2019\u00a0budgets and, especially, their mindsets. But even though people may be\u00a0feeling pinched, some are still willing to spend \u2014 if not splurge \u2014 on travel and leisure. And there is some good news on the inflation front in that regard: Airline fares dropped in April from March and are actually down a little more than 1% from February 2020, Consumer Price Index data shows. Americans aren\u2019t just taking to the slightly cheaper skies: AAA projected that a record 38.4 million people will take road trips over the long weekend. Gas prices rose sharply to start the year but have held fairly steady in recent weeks. On Monday, the national average for a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.59, a penny higher than this time last year, according to AAA. However, the prices at the pump on Monday were cheaper than last Memorial Day as well as the 10-year average for the holiday, according to GasBuddy data. US gasoline demand breached the 9 million barrels for the week ended May 25, according to GasBuddy data. Demand was up just 0.3% from the comparable pre-Memorial Day week last year, Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy spokesman, told CNN on Monday. \u201cIt was a weak start to the week but roared back on [Thursday through Saturday],\u201d he said via email. \u201cStill well below record gasoline demand, however.\u201d Gas Buddy modeled the current demand at just 9.03 million barrels per day.

{"id": "2024_05_23_economy_mortgage-rates-fall-week-of-may-23", "text": "Mortgage rates declined for the third consecutive week in a shred of good news for Americans dealing with a still-tough housing market. The standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.94% in the week ending May 23, down from last week\u2019s average of 7.02%, according to Freddie Mac data released Thursday. That\u2019s the lowest level since early April and below the key 7% threshold. After moving sideways throughout March, mortgage rates began to climb in late April as economic data showed that inflation\u2019s cooldown stalled earlier in the year. Mortgage rates track the benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield, which moves in anticipation of the Federal Reserve\u2019s decisions on interest rates. Stubbornly high inflation this year has dashed hopes that the Fed could cut interest rates in the spring or in the summer. But there\u2019s finally been some good news on that front: The Consumer Price Index for April, released last week, showed that inflation didn\u2019t pick up. Bond yields have mostly retreated this month. \u201cSpring homebuyers received an unexpected windfall this week, as mortgage rates fell below the seven percent threshold for the first time in over a month,\u201d Sam Khater, Freddie Mac\u2019s chief economist, said in a release. Some Fed officials said earlier this week that they likely won\u2019t raise interest rates again and a few have said they expect to cut rates this year. That bodes well for lower mortgage rates. But for now, the housing market\u2019s recovery is stagnant. Sales of previously owned homes, which make up the vast majority of the housing market, fell in April for the second month in a row, the National Association of Realtors reported Wednesday. That\u2019s a stark contrast from earlier in the year when sales soared. The persistent headache of not enough housing supply Mortgage rates are down from a two-decade peak reached last fall, but they\u2019re still higher than anything seen in the decade leading up to 2022.\u00a0That\u2019s not the only key issue besieging the housing market. Another is a persistent under-supply of housing that is simply not keeping up with demand, despite some steady improvements in recent months. That\u2019s partly due to some homeowners deciding to not sell their homes because they\u2019re holding onto the low mortgage rates they locked in before the Fed began to raise interest rates in 2022. With mortgage rates still elevated, some homeowners are deciding to stay put. The pace of residential construction is also not easing enough of the pressure on the housing market to meaningfully improve affordability. Housing starts rebounded in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.36 million units, after declining sharply in the prior month, according to a separate report released last week. But the trend is nowhere near where it should be to make the market easier for many Americans. \u201cThe country needs around 1.6 million or higher for a few years to truly bring about a balance in the housing sector,\u201d Lawrence Yun, NAR\u2019s chief economist, said in statement. \u201cThe housing shortage is not going away,\u201d he said. Still, there have been some steps in the right direction. NAR reported on Wednesday that housing supply continued to improve in April for the fourth straight month. Total housing inventory at the end of April was 1.21 million units, up 9% from the prior month and 16.3% from a year earlier, according to NAR data, though Yun said that \u201cwe still have tight inventory,\u201d Home prices remain painfully high Another hurdle is that home prices remain painfully elevated and out of reach for many Americans, especially first-time buyers. NAR reported Wednesday that home prices continued to rise in April, with the median price of an existing home increasing 5.7% from a year earlier to $407,600. That was the fourth straight monthly expansion and was a record for April prices. Other measures of home prices have shown the same: US home-price growth picked up in February at the fastest annual pace since November 2022, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index. Home prices in San Diego, Chicago and Detroit grew the most in February.

{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_28_cars_hybrid-porsche-911-revealed", "text": "Porsche unveiled the first hybrid version of its most famous sports car, the 911, on Tuesday, a move that could help electric motors become more accepted even in performance cars. The move also marks a major step in the evolution of one of the most recognizable cars in the world. Given their generally greater fuel efficiency without the sacrifice of power, hybrids have become commonplace in many types of vehicles. They have become increasingly popular in the United States even as sales of purely electric models have started to slow. The German automaker Porsche, a division of Volkswagen AG, already sells plug-in hybrid models like the Cayenne e-Hybrid SUV and Panamera e-Hybrid four-door car, but a hybrid 911 is another matter. Initially, hybrid power will be available in only one version of the car, the high performance 911 Carrera GTS. With an electric motor integrated into the car\u2019s eight-speed transmission assisting the car\u2019s six-cylinder gas engine, the new 911 model will produce up to 532 horsepower, 59 more than the current Carrera GTS model. Few cars are as defined by a gasoline engine as the 911, and few automakers are as defined by one model as Porsche is by the 911. While Porsche sells far more SUVs than sports cars these days, the 911 remains the automaker\u2019s\u00a0core model.\u00a0Even the Porsche Macan and Cayenne SUVs, with their rounded edges and sloped hoods, have nods in their designs to the 911. In another major change for Porsche, this car will not be a plug-in hybrid, as other Porsche hybrid models have been. The Porsche Cayenne e-Hybrid and Panamera e-Hybrid are plug-in hybrids with batteries that can be charged from an EV charger as well as by the vehicles\u2019 own engine. Those models can also drive some distance on only electric power after the battery has been fully charged. The 911 Carrera GTS will be a fully self-contained hybrid, charged only by power from the engine and from braking. It will not be able to drive significant distances on electric power alone. Besides hybrids, Porsche also sells fully electric cars, the Taycan and the new Macan Electric SUV. But executives have said the\u00a0911 would be the last Porsche to become all-electric, because its engineering is so unique and quintessential to its brand. By taking away the engine in the back, which gave the car the distinctive shape and rear-weighted driving feel, what makes it a 911? This new hybrid model, which still has its gas engine mounted in the back, will be the closest Porsche can get to an electric 911 without raising those sorts of questions. Although electric vehicle sales in the US continue to rise, the rate of growth has slowed sharply in recent months. Meanwhile, sales of hybrids are growing faster. Blame for slowing EV sales has been placed on relatively high prices of the models currently for sale and a lack of reliable public EV chargers. Hybrids are generally cheaper and don\u2019t require a charger. This particular hybrid will not be cheap, though. Prices for the 2025 Porsche 911 Carrera GTS will start at around $165,000. A Porsche test driver drove the hybrid around Germany\u2019s famed\u00a0N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife racetrack in 7 minutes and 17 seconds \u2014 8.7 seconds faster than a comparable current-generation 911 Carrra GTS. The N\u00fcrburgring is a twisty, challenging track, so the faster time also indicates the car\u2019s handling isn\u2019t hindered by the added weight of batteries and electric motors. The unveiling of the new hybrid version comes about 60 years after Porsche launched the 911. The first 911 was unveiled in 1963 but didn\u2019t go into production until 1964. It was a larger and more powerful addition to Porsche\u2019s original model \u2014 the 356. Both models, which were produced together for only a few years, had small back seats and engines mounted behind the rear wheels. The layout was similar to the\u00a0Volkswagen Beetle, a car designed by Ferdinand Porsche Sr., the father of Ferdinand \u201cFerry\u201d Porsche, who created the 356. Ferry\u2019s son, Ferdinand \u201cButzi\u201d Porsche, worked on the design of the 911, modeled after the 356\u2019s teardrop shape. Its form, including the increasingly cramped back seats, has remained fundamentally the same since the original model.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/cars/hybrid-porsche-911-revealed/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

In a\u00a0blog post, OpenAI said the new committee would be led by CEO Sam Altman as well as Bret Taylor, the company\u2019s board chair, and board member Nicole Seligman. The announcement follows\u00a0the high-profile exit\u00a0this month of an OpenAI executive focused on safety, Jan Leike. Leike resigned from OpenAI leveling criticisms that the company had underinvested in AI safety work and that tensions with OpenAI\u2019s leadership had \u201creached a breaking point.\u201d It also comes after the departure of Ilya Sutskever, another leader of OpenAI\u2019s so-called \u201csuperalignment\u201d team focused on ensuring that AI development serves human needs and priorities. Sutskever played a key role in Altman\u2019s\u00a0surprise ouster\u00a0as CEO last year, only to reverse course and later throw his support behind Altman\u2019s return. Earlier this month, an OpenAI spokesperson told CNN that dismantling the superalignment team and reassigning those employees across the company would help it better achieve its superalignment goals.

Investors providing the second-round funding included Sequoia Capital, Andreesen Horowitz, and Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, xAI announced in a blog post on Sunday. Musk, who founded xAI in July last year, wrote Monday on X that there would be \u201cmore to announce in the coming weeks,\u201d and that the startup had a valuation of $18 billion before receiving the new funding. xAI said in its post that the new money would be used to take the firm\u2019s \u201cfirst products to market, build advanced infrastructure, and accelerate the research and development of future technologies.\u201d The funding sets the company up as a potential rival to OpenAI, the AI research group behind the wildly popular chatbot ChatGPT. Musk is a co-founder of OpenAI, but\u00a0stepped down\u00a0as chairman six years ago partly over disagreements about the co\ufeffmpany\u2019s direction. In November, xAI announced that it was developing an AI-powered chatbot called \u201cGrok\u201d for some paying users of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter which Musk also owns. The billionaire said in a post on X at the time that Grok was being trained by having \u201creal-time access\u201d to information on the site. Since then, xAI has announced versions of Grok 1.5 with improved long context and image capabilities, and it is currently recruiting for engineers and researchers in Palo Alto, San Francisco and London. Investors, lured by the potential for AI to revolutionize the way people live and work, have thrown huge sums of money at AI companies in recent years. Microsoft (MSFT) is OpenAI\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the firm. Last year, Amazon (AMZN) announced it would invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic AI in exchange for partial ownership of the company. Bringing AI products to market is far from straightforward for even the biggest players. Earlier this month, Google introduced an AI-generated search tool, which summarizes results so that users don\u2019t have to click through multiple links to get quick answers to their questions. But the feature came under fire after it provided false or misleading information, prompting the company to walk back some factually incorrect results.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/tech/elon-musk-xai-6-billion-funding/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_tech_meta-ai-adivsory-council-white-men", "text": "Meta this week appointed a group of outside advisors to provide guidance on its artificial intelligence strategy. The four-person advisory group is composed entirely of White men. The tech giant said the group, which includes tech entrepreneurs and investors, will periodically consult with Meta\u2019s management \u201con strategic opportunities related to our technology and product roadmap.\u201d The move comes as Meta plans to invest tens of billions of dollars this year in AI infrastructure, research and product development. The council includes Patrick Collison, the co-founder and chief executive of financial technology company Stripe; Nat Friedman, the tech investor and former CEO of GitHub; Tobi L\u00fctke, the founder and CEO of online shopping firm Shopify; and Charlie Songhurst, the tech investor who formerly led corporate strategy and drove several key acquisitions at Microsoft. A Meta spokesperson confirmed the group will not be paid. Despite the group\u2019s significant combined experience, Meta is already taking heat for failing to include women or people of color \u2014 or anyone else outside of the wealthy, White, male, Silicon Valley mold \u2014 in a group advising one of the world\u2019s most powerful tech companies on a revolutionary new technology. The members of the group are also all in their 30s or 40s. The situation mirrors an incident last year at OpenAI when, in the wake of a leadership shakeup, it came under fire for appointing a board composed entirely of White men. Months later, OpenAI added three women directors to the board. Artificial intelligence is poised to disrupt nearly every area of life in coming years, from how we get hired and work to how we consume entertainment or search for information. The large language models that underpin AI systems are trained on vast troves of data, often written by humans and coming from the internet. Experts say that can create the risk of\u00a0further spreading all-too-human biases\u00a0already entrenched in internet discourse, but at a frighteningly larger scale. And historically, women and people of color have borne the brunt of harms from tech advancements \u2014 making their inclusion in decision-making processes all the more important. Already, women are increasingly becoming the targets of nonconsensual pornography enabled by AI. Meta\u2019s AI-generated photo tool also faced backlash last month for its apparent struggles to create images of couples or friends from different racial backgrounds. Research released last year also suggested that Meta\u2019s Facebook algorithm targets users with job postings based on gender stereotypes, although the company does not allow advertisers themselves to target ads based on gender. \u201cWhen AI systems\u00a0are used as the gatekeeper of opportunities, it is critical that the oversight of the design,\u00a0development, and deployment of these systems reflect the communities that will be impacted by them,\u201d Joy Buolamwini, the founder of the\u00a0Algorithmic Justice League, an organization tracking the harms of artificial intelligence, told CNN earlier this year.

Americans might be noticing markdowns for some everyday essentials during their weekly grocery runs. That doesn\u2019t mean the battle against inflation is won. Walmart saw first-quarter sales at stores open at least a year climb 3.8% from the prior year, in part thanks to its ability to keep prices low even as inflation remains sticky. The largest retailer in the United States has been a mainstay for cash-strapped consumers shopping for deals on groceries and other merchandise. Now Walmart is taking things one step further. The superstore said on May 16 that it has rolled back prices on nearly 7,000 items in its stores, noting deflationary trends in general merchandise. Inflation during the first quarter increased at half the rate seen last year, it added. \u201cOur combination of everyday low prices plus a large number of rollbacks is resonating\u201d with consumers, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on a call with analysts. On Monday, Target slashed prices on more than 1,500 items, ranging from laundry detergent to cat food to sunscreen, with thousands more price cuts expected over the summer. For example, the price of a pack of 16 Huggies baby wipes fell to 99 cents from $1.19 and roasted nuts from the Good & Gather brand now cost $5.29 from $6.89, according to a press release. The company on Wednesday reported its fourth consecutive quarter of sales declines at stores open for at least one year as higher prices strain Target\u2019s core middle-class customer base. Other retailers including Ikea and Aldi have also reduced prices in recent months. Some economists say that while price cuts from retailers are a welcome sign that inflation overall has come down, inflation in other areas also needs to ebb to reach the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. Price cuts at big box retailers are \u201cgoing to be helpful, but we\u2019re still going to have to see housing inflation come down, which is an issue, and wage growth continue to normalize,\u201d said Preston Caldwell, senior US economist at Morningstar Research Services. The median price of a previously owned home in the United States grew 5.7% in April from a year earlier to $407,600, the highest April price on record. Wage gains slowed last month but are still above historical averages. The Fed\u2019s progress on tamping down inflation stalled during the first quarter of this year, raising concerns that the central bank won\u2019t cut rates until this fall or even next year. Unemployment remains at historic lows, worrying some that the Fed will want to see the job market cool further before deciding to ease its restrictive policy. Still, recent data has suggested that inflation is cooling again. Consumer prices rose 3.4% for the 12 months ended in April, easing from 3.5% the month before, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Investors will get more inflation data next week from the Personal Consumption Expenditures index for April. The economy is also showing signs of cooling. Americans are falling behind on their payments, running down their pandemic savings and becoming more frugal. Retail sales were unchanged last month from March, when spending increased by a downwardly revised 0.6%, in another sign that consumers are dialing down their spending. Why OpenAI should fear a Scarlett Johansson lawsuit Will Scarlett Johansson sue OpenAI for creating a voice assistant that sounds like the actor\u2019s performance in the 2013 film \u201cHer,\u201d about a man who falls in love with an artificial intelligence? That\u2019s how things could go after Johansson said OpenAI tried to hire her to voice an AI assistant for ChatGPT and, when she refused, forged ahead with a sound-alike voice. OpenAI\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Sam Altman, could be directly in the crosshairs of such a lawsuit, writes my colleague Brian Fung. Now, legal experts say Johansson may have a powerful and credible claim in court if she does decide to sue, pointing to a long string of past cases that could lead to significant damages for one of the world\u2019s leading AI companies and raise questions about the industry\u2019s readiness to deal with AI\u2019s many messy complications. That OpenAI was apparently unaware of that legal history, or at worst willfully ignorant of it, highlights what some critics say is a lack of industry oversight in AI and a need for greater protections for creators. OpenAI didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. There are two types of law that could potentially be involved here, according to legal experts, but only one is likely to come into play based on the currently known facts. Read more here.

US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing. Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive. Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year. The stock is one of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that have powered the lion\u2019s share of the market\u2019s returns this year, boosted by Wall Street\u2019s bet that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in tech.

{"id": "2024_05_28_economy_us-economy-job-market-may", "text": "Americans\u2019 attitudes toward the economy improved this month for the first time since January, thanks to better perceptions of the job market. The Conference Board\u2019s Consumer Confidence Index for this month climbed to a reading of 102, up from 97.5 in April. Americans of all age groups felt better about the economy, the survey noted. That\u2019s after consumer confidence declined in each of the prior three months. \u201cConsumers\u2019 assessment of current business conditions was slightly less positive than last month. However, the strong labor market continued to bolster consumers\u2019 overall assessment of the present situation,\u201d Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board, said in a release. Compared to the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer survey, the Conference Board survey puts more weight on perceptions of the job market. Unemployment remains below 4%, job openings still exceed the number of unemployed people seeking work and employers are still pumping out jobs at a brisk pace. But elevated inflation still looms large. That\u2019s precisely why consumer confidence declined for three straight months prior to May, when inflation readings came in hotter than expected. The April survey showed that \u201cconsumers cited prices, especially for food and groceries, as having the greatest impact on their view of the US economy,\u201d Peterson said. The survey also showed that respondents felt more upbeat about the stock market, with \u201c48.2% expecting stock prices to increase over the year ahead, compared to 25.4% expecting a decrease and 26.4% expecting no change.\u201d Major stock indexes have soared to record highs recently, with the Nasdaq Composite briefly breaking above 17,000 in intraday trading Tuesday. Separately on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York released survey data on consumer expectations for a wide array of public policies, such as taxes, unemployment benefits and housing assistance. The survey, conducted in April, found that a higher share of Americans saw improved prospects for an increase in the federal minimum wage as well as higher welfare and unemployment benefits. Additionally, respondents\u2019 expectations increased for expansions in federal student aid as well as student loan forgiveness. However, in a time when home prices are setting new highs, the survey also showed that pessimism heightened about increases in housing assistance and affordable housing.The average likelihood of reduced housing assistance increased to 15%, the highest reading since December 2019, New York Fed data shows. Still, consumers were more optimistic about tax benefits for homeowners. The average likelihood for a higher mortgage interest tax deduction climbed to 24.8% \u2014 the highest ever reading for this New York Fed series, which was started in November 2015.

{"id": "2024_05_27_economy_more-americans-are-retiring-abroad-heres-why", "text": "Laura Barnett has always had a bit of wanderlust. When she was a kid, her father took a job as a teacher with the US Department of Defense and moved his family from rural Kentucky to Poitiers, France, which is when the travel bug hit. She\u2019s been to over 38 countries in her 54 years. But during the pandemic, something changed. Travel was impossible, and her life in Fayetteville, North Carolina, started to feel small. \u201cI just got sick of living in suburbia. It felt like the world was potentially going to end, and I [said to my husband], \u2018dude, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done everything we want to do.\u2019\u201d She brought up the idea of moving to Portugal. As America\u2019s retirement crisis grows, so too does the dream of retiring abroad where cities are walkable, social services plentiful and the cost of living affordable: Gelato in the piazza, white sand and year-round sun, little villages tucked into ocean coves and cheap health care all sound pretty good. But while retirees might imagine spending their golden years full of pasta and palazzos, the realities of moving abroad are much less romantic. There\u2019s often more bureaucracy than bruschetta. Laura\u2019s husband, Chris, was initially skeptical about the move. He didn\u2019t think retiring abroad was feasible. Plus, they\u2019d be leaving behind their two sons and two grandsons. But Laura persisted. \u201cWe\u2019ve done everything they told us to do. We\u2019ve saved our money. We\u2019ve worked for the same company for decades. We\u2019ve done everything, and I keep looking to the future \u2014 and I can\u2019t stomach having to work until I\u2019m 65 years old just because we can\u2019t afford health care otherwise,\u201d she said. \u201c[The US] has set up a system where even if we have the money to cover our day-to-day expenses \u2014 rent, food, travel \u2014 all of a sudden there\u2019s this other line item called health care. That\u2019s about $1,500 a month, more than our house payment.\u201d Chris and Laura have traveled to Portugal three times to look for places to settle and have a three-year plan set in place to move there permanently. There are a lot of upsides: The weather is favorable year-round, it\u2019s affordable, private health insurance costs about $300 per month for couples and there\u2019s a better sense of work-life balance. (CNN converted prices throughout this story into US dollars from local currencies.) But there are also some downsides. Leaving behind family is a big one. Until the Barnetts receive their residency card, they\u2019ll only be allowed to leave and enter Portugal twice, and their initial arrival into the country counts. \u201cWe have aging parents in their late 80s.\u00a0Not having the freedom to easily respond if we are needed until we have that card is very concerning. Being lonely and not having friends and having to start from scratch with that is also in this mix,\u201d said Laura. Portuguese is not an easy language to learn, and adapting to a new culture late in life won\u2019t be easy. Recent revisions to Portuguese immigration programs also make the tax situation much less favorable for Americans. But in the end, the finances won out. \u201cOur goal, which is very doable based on research, is to live on less than $3,500 per month in Portugal while still being able to afford travel in Europe,\u201d said Laura. Their financial adviser told them that to comfortably retire in the US, they\u2019d need to have about double that amount \u2014 $7,000 per month. Packing up shop As America\u2019s retirement crisis grows, so too does the dream of retiring abroad. It\u2019s becoming increasingly expensive to retire in the US. Just 43% of non-retired adults in the US think they will have enough money to live comfortably when they retire, according to Gallup in 2023. That\u2019s the lowest level for that metric since 2012. At the same time, the number of Americans looking to settle outside of the country has tripled over the past 30 years, according to a 2024 Monmouth poll. The number of Social Security recipients living outside the US increased from 307,000 in 2008 to more than 450,000 in 2022. Some countries are even taking advantage of this boom and have eased their visa requirements to attract older US expats. But packing up a life and moving it abroad is not a simple task, and retirees often find themselves in over their heads. \u201cPeople need to think about estate planning, which is often different abroad,\u201d said Brett Spencer, the founder of Impact Financial, a financial advisory firm that specializes in Americans living abroad. \u201cThey need to think about currency, complicated taxes and their investments. Even opening a bank account abroad can be complicated.\u201d Spencer says he\u2019s had clients who have had their bank accounts closed with no warning, leaving them working through nuanced protocol in another language and without access to any funds. These types of complications aren\u2019t uncommon. Escape to Italy Patience Dunbar, who will be 63 next month, and her husband, Charles Ippoliti, 69, have been living full time in Arona, a lakeside town in northern Italy, since 2022. Their typical day consists of coffee and the crossword, a leisurely stroll around the lake, stops at the local outdoor market for fresh fruit and vegetables and a lunch in the town square. Occasionally, they\u2019ll take the train into Milan, about 40 minutes away. \u201cIt\u2019s a very leisurely pace,\u201d said Charles. They feel healthier than they did back home, they\u2019ve lost weight and they are exercising more. That\u2019s part of the reason they decided to look abroad in the first place. In 2020, when the couple was living in Oregon, Charles suffered from severe Covid complications. He was hospitalized for a few weeks and then put on oxygen at home for a few more. \u201cWe thought \u2018well this is silly, why are we wasting our time?\u2019 As soon as we could we decided to make the most of this,\u201d said Patience. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to wait five more years until Charles was in his late 70s to retire. What if he\u2019s not able to enjoy those years?\u201d The pair applied for their codice fiscale, similar to a Social Security number, and purchased their apartment in Arona. They paid about $72,000 for their first apartment there and later sold it and upgraded to a larger home for $160,000. The food is less expensive and a fancy dinner with wine runs them about $55. Most importantly, they pay $2,200 a year for their health care. That includes visits with specialists for Charles, who has a heart condition. But it\u2019s hard to be away from family, and they have struggled to learn Italian. They thought the language would come more easily. Dealing with the government can be troubling at times, and filing paperwork has become a full-time job for them. Plus, they\u2019re starting to worry about the political landscape. Giorgia Meloni, a far-right leader, is the current Italian premier and has anti-immigration views. They worry that policy could change and they might have to go back to the States. We\u2019re not in Kansas anymore \u201cI would say that, without a doubt, whatever lifestyle you want, you\u2019ll be able to find it at a lower cost than you could in the United States,\u201d said Kathleen Peddicord, the founder and CEO of advisory firm Live and Invest Overseas. \u201cUnless the lifestyle you want is living in a small town in the Midwest,\u201d she added. \u201cIf what you want in retirement is to live in a small town, surrounded by your family and your grandkids, that\u2019s great.\u201d Living abroad isn\u2019t for everyone. It probably won\u2019t work for those who seek out creature comforts in their retirement. \u201cIt\u2019s hard work. I think that\u2019s the reality that a lot of people probably aren\u2019t prepared for,\u201d said Peddicord, who splits her time with her husband between Paris and Panama City, Panama. Some people Peddicord advises don\u2019t make it to another country because they get burned out by the loads of administrative work involved. \u201cYou have to create a whole new life for yourself in a very short space of time, in another culture, in another language,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of the things that you do to create your life in the States: You got a driver\u2019s license at 15 or 16, you opened a bank account, you got your first credit card, you bought a car, you rented a house, you paid utilities, you did all that over time. Now you have to do it at once and without the support of friends and family.\u201d Many people who make the move end up feeling isolated and lonely. Still, Peddicord says her business has exploded as more Americans retire abroad, and a cottage industry to help people navigate the nuances of the task has quickly sprung up. South of the border As retirement decisions loomed for Bill and Jacki Dahl, now 69 and 75, respectively, they were forced to confront the fact that their retirement income would not continue to support the same lifestyle they had enjoyed in the US while working. They decided that moving to a less expensive country was a good way to stretch their dollar and keep their lifestyle the same. After four years of research and four exploratory trips, they made the move to Quer\u00e9taro, a city in the center of Mexico. In 2019, the Dahls sold nearly everything they had accumulated during 30 years of marriage \u2014 including their home in Oregon \u2014 to fund the trip, said goodbye to their four children and grandchildren, and drove to Mexico. Upon arriving, they finalized their official immigration documents \u2014 they\u2019re both \u201cresidente-permanente,\u201d permanent residents, meaning they\u2019re still US citizens. They rent a three-bedroom, two-story home with a large garden for about $940 a month. Food is cheap, and they have Medicare so that they can return to the United States for any serious medical care. But for smaller things, they remain local \u2014 it costs about $35 to visit the dentist, for example. \u201cWe live on a fixed monthly income,\u201d said Bill. \u201cWe do not have a bunch of savings. We do not have a bunch of investments,\u201d but they\u2019re able to get by and still have money left over for travel and adventure. \u201cWe both adore people, art, food, travel and cultural diversity,\u201d said Bill. \u201cWe love it here.\u201d Still, it hasn\u2019t been smooth sailing. \u201cRelocation to Mexico is not for everyone,\u201d he warned. Climate change means that there are more droughts in Mexico and more pollution, water can be scarce, and sometimes the power goes out, said Bill. Another surprise for the Dahls has been the rising strength of the peso against the US dollar. Bill estimates that his purchasing power is now worth about 30% less than it was before the pandemic. The financial requirements for legal, permanent residency in Mexico have also increased substantially, and immigration services are \u201ccumbersome and inefficient,\u201d said Bill. Violence is on the rise ahead of national elections later this year, he added. It\u2019s not for the faint of heart, or people who want a carefree retirement, he said. But, he added, \u201cwe have no desire whatsoever to return to live in the US\u2026we are deeply grateful to be resident-guests of such a marvelous place to live during the retirement season of our life.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/economy/more-americans-are-retiring-abroad-heres-why/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit.
