{"id": "2024_06_11_business_uaw-president-shawn-fain-investigation", "text": "Shawn Fain, who led the United Auto Workers union in its strike against all three unionized American automakers last fall, is under investigation by a federal monitor overseeing the union. The news of the investigations and competing allegations come at a bad time for the union as it campaigns to organize non-union auto plants around the country. It dredges up past union corruption issues that sent previous union officials to prison, an issue that helped Fain win a narrow upset victory to lead the union last year. And it gives management of the nonunion auto plants another talking point when trying to convince their employers to vote against UAW representation. So far the union has won a significant victory at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee, but lost a vote at a Mercedes plant in Alabama. Competing allegations Two other top officials in the union have launched allegations of misconduct against Fain, who has previously accused them of misconduct. Officials are exploring the charges.  Fain said he had to strip many duties from Margaret Mock, the union\u2019s Secretary Treasurer and second highest ranking officer, because she \u201cengaged in misconduct while carrying out her financial oversight responsibilities,\u201d according to the report by Neil Barofsky, a lawyer appointed by a court as federal monitor. And Fain said he had to take away the duty of overseeing relations with automaker Stellantis from UAW Vice President Rich Boyer due to \u201c\u2019dereliction of duty\u2019 in connection with certain collective bargaining issues,\u201d according to the report. Details of the allegations were not included in the report. But both Mock and Boyer, who ran on the same slate of candidates as Fain in the union elections just over a year ago, say that the actions against them were not justified. Barofsky wrote that Mock filed \u201callegations of her own\u201d against Fain and that his actions against her were in \u201cretaliation for her refusal or reluctance to authorize certain expenditures of funds at the request of and/or for the benefit of those in the president\u2019s office.\u201d Barofsky said that Boyer charged Fain acted against him for \u201crefusing to engage in acts of financial misconduct to benefit others.\u201d The details of Mock and Boyer\u2019s allegations, respectively, against Fain were also not included in the report. Fain\u2019s response Fain issued a statement late Monday defending actions he took that he said sparked the investigations. \u201cTaking our union in a new direction means sometimes you have to rock the boat, and that upsets some people who want to keep the status quo, but our membership expects better and deserves better than the old business as usual,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cWe encourage the monitor to investigate whatever claims are brought to their office, because we know what they\u2019ll find: a UAW leadership committed to serving the membership, and running a democratic union. We\u2019re staying focused on winning record contracts, growing our union, and fighting for economic and social justice on and off the job.\u201d The union agreed to a consent decree in 2021 to create the position for a federal monitor to settle federal corruption charges after past union officials, including two past presidents went to prison. The settlement also set up the first popular union election among members for the union\u2019s leadership, rather than having leaders chosen by delegates to union conventions. That opened the door for Fain\u2019s victory. Barofsky, who had previously served as Inspector General for TARP, the federal fund that helped bail out major banks and two major automakers during the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009. He said in his report that while the union had generally cooperated with his office in the past, it has been less forthcoming with these probes, writing that it \u201cput roadblocks that are interfering with the monitor\u2019s ability to promptly and credibly conduct them.\u201d He said it has only produced a fraction of the documents his office requested. In the last year Fain has gone from a relatively obscure challenger for the union\u2019s top job to one of the highest profile union officials in the country, after he led the unprecedented three simultaneous strikes against General Motors, Ford and Stellantis last fall. That strike resulted in record wage and other gains for more than 140,000 union members at the three automakers. Fain was a guest of President Joe Biden at the State of the Union speech, where Biden recognized and praised him. Biden also joined Fain on the picket line during last year\u2019s auto strike, the first sitting president to visit a picket line. Fain, a former critic of both former President Donald Trump and the Biden administration, has become a vocal supporter of Biden, who has been endorsed by the UAW.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/business/uaw-president-shawn-fain-investigation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_tech_elon-musk-apple-ban-openai", "text": "Elon Musk is not happy about a new partnership between Apple and ChatGPT creator OpenAI. In a post to X Monday, the Tesla (TSLA) chief executive said he would ban Apple (AAPL) devices at his companies \u2014 which include SpaceX and X, among others \u2014 if the iPhone maker went ahead with its AI plans announced Monday. If Apple \u201cintegrates OpenAI at the (operating system) level,\u201d Musk said that would constitute \u201can unacceptable security violation.\u201d He added that visitors \u201cwill have to check their Apple devices at the door, where they will be stored in a Faraday cage,\u201d referring to an enclosure that blocks electromagnetic waves crucial to communications, including cellular, wireless internet and Bluetooth signals. \u201cApple has no clue what\u2019s actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI,\u201d Musk said in a separate post. \u201cThey\u2019re selling you down the river.\u201d CNN has contacted Apple and OpenAI for comment. Musk\u2019s comments came hours after Apple unveiled the partnership with OpenAI at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, part of a wider push to bring generative artificial intelligence tools to Apple products. Under a new \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d system, AI will be used to produce a smarter Siri voice assistant and deliver more personalized tools to users. OpenAI\u2019s technology will support some of these new tools \u2014 for example, allowing users to direct questions to ChatGPT via their Apple devices. Greg Brockman, OpenAI president, said late Monday that ChatGPT would be integrated into Apple\u2019s operating systems for iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. \u201cWe\u2019re partnering with Apple to integrate ChatGPT right into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Will be available later this year, very excited!\u201d he posted on X. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015, now runs a rival firm called xAI. He has a fraught relationship with his former company and its CEO Sam Altman and is suing them both for allegedly breaching OpenAI\u2019s founding agreement and diverging from its nonprofit mission. OpenAI has in legal filings dismissed these claims as \u201cfrivolous,\u201d \u201cextraordinary\u201d and \u201ca fiction\u201d and has separately suggested Musk is essentially jealous that he is no longer involved with the company, given its success. Given his track record of broken promises and wild threats, it remains to be seen whether Musk will follow through with a ban on Apple devices or perhaps even widen it to include other brands. For example, Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL) Google and Samsung have already integrated new AI features into Android devices. Microsoft, OpenAI\u2019s biggest investor, announced three weeks ago that it would integrate AI features directly into Windows. So Musk\u2019s employees may have limited options if he wants to ban rival AI \u2014 or even OpenAI \u2014 from his companies. But Microsoft, facing a backlash over privacy concerns, said Friday that it would turn off some AI features by default. \u201cApple\u2019s AI approach is actually more privacy conscious than others, with its aim to process as much on the device as possible and with a fallback that explicitly asks users before sending information to OpenAI,\u201d said Catherine Flick, professor of ethics and games technology at Staffordshire University in England. \u201cIt remains to be seen how that workflow ends up being used in practice, but this just feels like sour grapes from Musk who runs a competing AI company that was not given the lucrative Apple contract.\u201d OpenAI has become one of the companies leading the development of generative AI. Apple, meanwhile, has lagged behind competitors, including Google and Microsoft (MSFT), which have moved more quickly to articulate an AI strategy. Apple\u2019s partnership with OpenAI could help the iPhone maker close that gap and accelerate its move into a technology that holds enormous potential. \u201cThis is a key moment for Apple, which has struggled with innovation of late,\u201d Matt Britzman, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, wrote in a note Tuesday. \u201cIntegrating a third-party tool like ChatGPT finally gets things moving, while leaving space to develop internal models over the next few years at much lower costs than the first movers.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/tech/elon-musk-apple-ban-openai/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_business_singapore-airlines-turbulence-compensation-intl-hnk", "text": "Singapore Airlines has offered compensation to passengers hurt last month during a flight that encountered severe turbulence, which resulted in dozens of injuries and one death. Passengers who sustained minor injuries have each been offered $10,000 in compensation, while those who suffered more serious injuries have been invited to discuss an offer, the carrier said Tuesday in a Facebook post. \u201cPassengers medically assessed as having sustained serious injuries, requiring long-term medical care, and requesting financial assistance are offered an advance payment of US$25,000 to address their immediate needs,\u201d the airline wrote. \u201cThis will be part of the final compensation that these passengers will receive.\u201d In addition, all passengers on the May 20 flight SQ321 from London to Singapore will be refunded the cost of their tickets, it added. The Boeing\u00a0777-300ER was about 10 hours into its flight and midway through the meal service when it hit turbulence while flying over Myanmar\u2019s Irrawaddy Basin. Geoff Kitchen, a 73-year-old British man, died from a suspected heart condition, according to Thai officials. The aircraft was diverted to Bangkok following the incident. Singapore-based broadcaster Channel News Asia reported last week that around 10 passengers remained in a Thai hospital more than two weeks after the flight. Two or three had been flown home in air ambulances. The Advertiser, an Australian newspaper, reported on Sunday that one of the passengers, Kerry Jordan, has been left paralyzed from the chest down. Data from aviation tracking site FlightRadar24\u00a0showed the flight suddenly dipping and then rapidly climbing a few hundred feet, then dipping and climbing again, before finally settling back at its cruising altitude. The entire disruption lasted about 90 seconds, according to the data. Turbulence occurs when a plane flies through clashing bodies of air moving at widely different speeds. Flight SQ321 likely encountered rapidly developing thunderstorms over southern Myanmar during the time that extreme turbulence was reported, according to analysis by CNN\u00a0Weather.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/business/singapore-airlines-turbulence-compensation-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_tech_apple-ai-next-big-thing", "text": "Apple just kicked off a brand new era for the company with the introduction of its first generative AI features for the iPhone. At its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, the company unveiled the first batch of tools powered by \u201cApple Intelligence,\u201d from personalized Genmoji \u2013 Apple\u2019s AI-generated emoji \u2013 to a significantly smarter Siri, which can answer questions about your schedule, what\u2019s in your email and what time your loved one\u2019s flight is landing. It also announced a partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI to power the features. Although the partnership will likely give the company a much-needed boost, Apple aligning itself with a company and a technology that have yet to win public trust, facing criticism for taking user inputs and incorporating them into ChatGPT\u2019s data set may cause some challenges down the road. Apple emphasized privacy and security during its presentation, noting most AI functions will be done on the phone, keeping inputs away from a far-off server cloud. A big push into AI could spur growth for iPhone sales and services for years to come, as users are now waiting longer to upgrade their devices and an uncertain economic environment weighs on consumers, particularly in China. The company also faces regulatory scrutiny in Washington and was passed this week by chip maker Nvidia as the second-largest public company in the US. The company said it\u2019s been impressed with the generative AI tools already on the market, but wanted to make it more personal with privacy in mind. \u201cAs we look to build in these incredible new capabilities, we want to ensure that the outcome reflects the principles at the core of our products, it has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the keynote. \u201cIt has to be intuitive and easy to use. It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences.\u201d He added: \u201cMost importantly, it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context, like your routine, your relationships, your communications, and more. And, of course, it has to be built with privacy, from the ground up.\u201d The timing is also noteworthy: Apple is not always first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the most cutting-edge technology. Here\u2019s a closer look at what Apple announced at its big event: AI, AI and more AI Apple is embracing generative AI \u2013 the buzzy form of artificial intelligence that can provide thoughtful and thorough responses to questions \u2013 through Siri, the company\u2019s virtual assistant with a hit-or-miss track record, essentially turning it into an iPhone chatbot. This could enable Siri to perform specific tasks such as recalling a picture taken years ago on the device or answering detailed questions about the weather, the news or trivia. It can also perform more advanced tasks, such as answering when a user\u2019s mom\u2019s plane is landing, by analyzing information previously sent in an email. Over time, it could learn the user\u2019s preferences and respond accordingly. This is not unlike what some competitors have already introduced in generative tools. Siri will also likely adapt automatically and seamlessly to users, based on voice, audio and natural language, along with images and contextual cues. Users will also be able to create personalized photos, such as taking a picture of your mom and making it into a stylized, cartoon-y version, adding a superhero cape. It can take action across apps, including asking the software to pull up all photos of a family member, and retrieve and analyze data from across your apps, such as factoring in what\u2019s on your screen like email or a calendar. If a meeting is being rescheduled, Apple Intelligence can process relevant personal data and see the email your kid sent days before about a recital, alerting users if there may be a conflict. In a Q&A following the keynote, Cook once again said the company is taking privacy and security very seriously with the rollout of the new technology. \u201cWe think AI\u2019s role is not to replace users but to empower them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you think about what\u2019s possible, it has to be integrated with the experience and be intuitive, and informed by your personal context and knowledge of you. If you\u2019re going to do that, there\u2019s a lot of responsibility.\u201d Beyond AI Apple kicked off its iOS 18 portion of the event by highlighting new controls and personalization coming to iOS 18, including a revamped look for all icons when it goes into Dark Mode, a new tint color that compliments wallpaper and a redesigned control center that is available from the lock screen, so you can swap the flashlight icon for other tools. Apple said it is also doubling down on privacy and security, such as giving users the option to \u201clock\u201d certain apps, making them accessible only via Face ID, Touch ID or a user\u2019s passcode. The feature could be especially helpful to protect apps like a banking app, an insurance app, or if you\u2019re handing your phone over to show off photos or get someone\u2019s phone number. Users can now also \u201chide\u201d an app, so it will show up only in a locked, hidden folder. And media from hidden apps won\u2019t show up anywhere else on their phone. Text messages are getting a bump, too. The company said it will soon let people send texts via satellite, even if they don\u2019t have a cell or WiFi connection. Apple is also adding what it called one of the most requested features in iMessage: the ability to schedule messages. IPhone users will now be able to record and create transcripts of calls right from the phone app. All parties to the call will be notified when it is being recorded. Other product updates The company also made software updates to other products, including the Mac, AirPods and Apple Watch. Apple showed off its latest MacOS software called Sequoia, with a handful of new productivity features. Phone mirroring, for example, will bring iPhone alerts directly to the laptop that show up directly next to Mac notifications. MacOS will also support the ability to arrange windows open on screen in certain areas, such as side by side \u2014 a concept popularized by Microsoft Windows. Video conferencing is getting a presenter preview, so users can see what they\u2019re going to share before they share it. Apple is also introducing background replacements on calls, so users can hide the laundry behind them. Meanwhile, AirPods users will be able to answer or decline a call with just a nod or shake of their head. And new vital sign tracking on Apple Watch can notify users when they may be getting sick, based on signals like body temperature and heart rate. Vision Pro update Just a few months after its launch, Apple showed off a few upgrades coming to the software that powers its Vision Pro mixed reality headset. During its most recent earnings call, Cook said more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought an Apple Vision Pro. \u201c[We] are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren\u2019t possible before,\u201d he added. Vision OS 2 promises to offer more rich experiences for users, such as a wider display for work stations, new hand gestures that let you check battery life or open up the home screen, and get deeper inside the photos in your library, thanks to advanced machine learning that provides more natural depth. The company said it is also adding more capability for users to capture spatial videos. Apple is also bringing Vision Pro to more countries, including the UK, China, Japan Singapore and Australia, this summer. Upgrades could also boost sales of the pricey Vision Pro, which starts at $3,499. Demand for Apple\u2019s new headset has\u00a0reportedly\u00a0been weak.

Her answers are presented below, unedited. You\u2019re one of the highest rated hosts on television. What is unique about the audio format that makes it attractive to you as a storyteller?\u00a0I started in radio long before I ever somehow finagled my way onto TV, so when I\u2019m working out how to explain things or express myself or tell stories, I still think first about the spoken word. Audio also requires a little more precision in the writing and the delivery than TV does \u2014 in a visual medium, you can round off the edges a little bit with on-screen elements and body language, neither of which is available when all you have is a microphone. For projects that have a longer dramatic arc, like\u00a0\u2018Ultra\u2019\u00a0and\u00a0\u2018Bag Man,\u2019\u00a0I think the precision and rigor that audio production demands can build out the story in a way that hopefully makes it worthy of four or five hours of attention from listeners over the course of the season. For an anthology series like\u00a0\u2018D\u00e9j\u00e0 News,\u2019\u00a0I think the audio format helps showcase archival sound in way that\u2019s really cool \u2014 not to mention the fact that my co-host (and longtime TRMS producer)\u00a0Isaac-Davy Aronson\u00a0has the world\u2019s greatest radio voice, so that\u2019s an irresistible draw for me. Season two of \u201cUltra\u201d uses history to focus on \u201cthe frayed line between violent extremism and mainstream politics.\u201d That is a topic that is more relevant than ever these days, given the radicalization of the Republican Party under the leadership of Donald Trump. What important lesson can we learn from history to help us in this moment? I think that knowing the country has faced similar threats in the past (and I stress similar, not exactly the same) can help set expectations for how things might go this time around. As one example, we can observe in U.S. history that one of the risks of violent extremists getting intertwined with normal electoral politics is that people with political power will put inappropriate pressure on the criminal justice system when their allied extremists are charged with crimes. We should also know that DOJ hasn\u2019t always been great at resisting that pressure. Seeing that in our past should help us expect that and hopefully brace ourselves against it in our own time. As another example, it\u2019s somehow comforting and discomfiting at the same time to look at previous instances where factually-unhinged conspiratorial narratives have taken hold in mainstream politics. One of the takeaways from that history is just the confirmation that, yes, we\u2019re quite susceptible to that as a country; but also that patient, responsible, consistent debunking, and criticism of those lies has an effect on the American people. It takes a long time and it doesn\u2019t reach everyone, but it can influence the median voter in a way that ultimately can be decisive. When thinking about radicalization in America, the information environment plays a crucial role. What parallels did you find in the post-war 1950s and today? And would you say that the media environment is worse then or now? The media environment in the United States is a constantly shifting crazy-quilt landscape of authority, irresponsibility, partisanship, objectivity, heroism, corruption, and competition. We like to think of it as a riches-to-rags linear progression from good old days to today\u2019s mess. But it\u2019s kind of always been a mess. Don\u2019t believe me? Read the America-focused chapters in\u00a0Kathryn Olmsted\u2019s\u00a0\u201cThe Newspaper Axis: Six Press Barons Who Enabled Hitler.\u201d\u00a0Or pour yourself a stiff shot of something and spend some time with the mass media titan that was\u00a0Charles Coughlin\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Tablet Magazine\u2019s \u201cRadioactive\u201d\u00a0podcast\u00a0about him is a great place to start. In the time period covered by Season Two of \u201cUltra,\u201d there was the same mix of great and terrible, sometimes within the same outlet. Both\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0and\u00a0TIME\u00a0magazine, for example, fell hook line and sinker for a really gross foreign influence propaganda operation in 1949, while at the same time they were publishing prescient, urgent, and unique reporting from their foreign correspondents on the same malign actors who were perpetrating that hoax. So there\u2019s always a mix of good and bad. The best of our traditions, I think, should inspire us to keep trying to balance humility and ambition. Police professional standards really aggressively; be as transparent about sourcing as you are wary of liars; expect that you\u2019ll make mistakes and have a plan for fixing them when you do. One thing that stands out to me is that sunlight no longer appears to be an effective disinfectant. In fact, often the sunlight appears to help grow these sinister forces, given they feed off of attention. What do you make of that when looking back in history? It\u2019s frustrating in the moment, I know \u2014 we all face that question in daily news production every day: do I ignore this lie, thus letting it slide by unrebutted; or do I discuss the lie, thereby debunking it but also implicitly amplifying it in the process? There isn\u2019t a one-sized-fits-all solution for every lie. But knowing that the avalanche of lies is a political tactic at least helps us expect it, and hopefully to explain its tactical function to our audiences. Forewarned is forearmed. In\u00a0Robert Paxton\u2019s\u00a0\u201cAnatomy of Fascism,\u201d\u00a0he quotes Mussolini\u2019s answer to a question about his governing plans soon after he became prime minister: \u201cThe democrats of Il Mondo [newspaper in Rome] want to know our program? It is to break the bones of the democrats of Il Mondo. And the sooner the better.\u201d Authoritarian movements don\u2019t just hate journalists as a professional class, they want to destroy the idea that there is any knowable truth other than what the leader insists upon. When you come across someone in politics who is not just wrong but proudly irrational, they\u2019re not looking for a fact-check, they\u2019re looking for a fight. On the topic of debating whether to give certain politicians attention or not, I am curious about your current thinking on news networks broadcasting Trump live. For a little while, CNN and MSNBC declined to do so. But lately, that has changed. Do you believe that is for the better? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any simple hard-and-fast rule that makes these decisions easy. You take things case by case, situation by situation, lie by lie. I do think it\u2019s important to constantly revisit these decisions in a rigorous way, guarding in particular against letting ourselves be used for any purpose other than our own journalistic mission. Often, MSNBC is compared to Fox News. People say they watch Fox for the \u201cconservative\u201d perspective and MSNBC for the \u201cliberal\u201d perspective. It\u2019s obviously a flawed argument, given that Rupert Murdoch\u2019s channel operates with no regard for basic truth. But you must hear this argument made. How do you respond to it? I\u2019m hoping our work speaks for itself. Trump and his allies are openly talking about weaponizing the government to seek revenge against critics in media and politics, with some of his extremist allies even talking about jailing their fellow Americans. You\u2019re one of his most notable critics on television. Are you worried that you could be a target? I\u2019m worried about the country broadly if we put someone in power who is openly avowing that he plans to build camps to hold millions of people, and to\u00a0\u201croot out\u201d\u00a0what he\u2019s described in subhuman terms as his\u00a0\u201cenemy from within.\u201d Again, history is helpful here. He\u2019s not joking when he says this stuff, and we\u2019ve seen what happens when people take power proclaiming that kind of agenda. I think there\u2019s a little bit of head-in-the-sand complacency that Trump only intends to go after individual people he has already singled out. Do you really think he plans to stop at well-known liberals? It also seems pretty clear that some people in politics might think they\u2019ll be on the safe side \u2014 that they might even benefit from it \u2014 if they side with Trump. Ask Mike Pence about how that works out in the end. When Trump\u00a0invokes\u00a0the\u00a0Insurrection Act\u00a0to deploy the U.S. military against civilians on his first day in office, do you think he then rescinds the order on day two? For that matter, what convinces you that these massive\u00a0camps\u00a0he\u2019s planning are only for migrants? So, yes, I\u2019m worried about me \u2014 but only as much as I\u2019m worried about all of us. Do you think the news media \u2014 as a whole \u2014 is adequately covering Trump? It\u2019s commonplace, particularly in left-leaning circles, to hear complaints about how Trump is covered by news organizations. And it does seem that, far too often, these institutions could be a lot more clear-eyed when reporting on the extremist nature of the GOP. What is your perspective? Time is short. Our legal system and our system of elections are fully under attack already. And it\u2019s not a single extremist actor or a small faction leading the charge, it\u2019s now a fully joined project of one of the two major parties in the country. I think Americans broadly know that\u2019s happening, but also that they may not necessarily know what to do about it. Responsibly presenting information, in context, about how radical this is can help bring clarity to what\u00a0Jay Rosen\u00a0has\u00a0memorably\u00a0deemed \u201cnot the odds, but the stakes\u201d of the election. I\u2019m not a media critic and so I\u2019ll leave it to others to grade our performance overall. \u00a0But for me, I do find it helpful in a moment like this, to learn about how Americans before us stood up for our democracy when it was challenged. I hope it helps other people as well. Do you believe the truth always wins? I believe that nothing is inevitable. And that the worst and most misguided among us can change for the better. And that everyone can do something to help. If you ever wondered what you would do if you were called upon to help your country, that alarm bell you\u2019ve been hearing is meant for you. Now\u2019s when you give your answer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/media/rachel-maddow-authoritarianism-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_tech_mike-lynch-acquitted-fraud-hewlett-packard", "text": "Autonomy founder Mike\u00a0Lynch\u00a0was acquitted of fraud Thursday by a jury in San Francisco, a major win for the software entrepreneur who has been dogged by legal problems since the disastrous sale of his company to Hewlett-Packard (HP)\u00a0for $11 billion in 2011. Representatives for\u00a0Lynch\u00a0and US prosecutors said\u00a0Lynch\u00a0was acquitted on all 15 charges \u2014 one count of conspiracy and 14 counts of wire fraud. Former Autonomy finance executive Stephen Chamberlain, who faced the same charges at trial alongside\u00a0Lynch, was also acquitted on all counts, the\u00a0Lynch\u00a0representative said. The trial, where prosecutors said\u00a0Lynch\u00a0and Chamberlain schemed to inflate Autonomy\u2019s revenue, was the latest chapter in a legal saga stemming from the failed deal. The Autonomy sale was one of the biggest British tech deals at the time but quickly went sour, with HP writing down Autonomy\u2019s value by $8.8 billion within a year. \u201cI am elated with today\u2019s verdict,\u201d\u00a0Lynch, who was once compared with Apple\u2019s Steve Jobs and Microsoft\u2019s\u00a0Bill Gates, said in a statement. \u201cI am looking forward to returning to the UK and getting back to what I love most: my family and innovating in my field.\u201d Abraham Simmons, a spokesperson for the Office of the United States Attorney,\u00a0said: \u201cWe acknowledge and respect the verdict.\u201d Cambridge roots At the trial, which lasted three months, jurors heard from more than 30 government witnesses including Leo Apotheker, the former HP (HPE) CEO who was fired weeks after the Autonomy deal was announced. Cambridge University-educated Lynch\u00a0also\u00a0took the stand\u00a0in his own defense at the trial, denying wrongdoing and telling jurors that HP botched the two companies\u2019 integration. Prosecutors said\u00a0Lynch\u00a0and Chamberlain padded Autonomy\u2019s finances in several ways, including via back-dated agreements and fake contracts. Lynch\u2019s legal team argued at trial that HP was so eager to acquire Autonomy ahead of potential competitors that it rushed through due diligence before the sale. On the stand, the entrepreneur said he had been focused on tech issues, and entrusted money matters and the accounting decisions at issue to Sushovan Hussain, Autonomy\u2019s then-chief financial officer.\u00a0Hussain was separately convicted\u00a0in 2018 at a trial in the same court on charges related to the deal with HP. He was released from US prison in January after serving a five-year sentence. Lynch\u00a0turned ground-breaking research at Cambridge University into the foundation of Autonomy, which became Britain\u2019s biggest software company and a member of the blue-chip FTSE 100 index. He was lauded by academics and scientists and asked to advise the British government on technology and innovation. The Autonomy acquisition was meant to fuel HP\u2019s software business. Instead, it spawned a series of bitter and expensive legal battles.\u00a0HP largely won a civil lawsuit\u00a0against\u00a0Lynch\u00a0and Hussain in London in 2022, though damages have not yet been decided.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

Chestnut won the \u201cMustard Yellow Belt\u201d 16 times, ate a world record 76 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes in 2021 and has reportedly made hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars for his competitive eating of hot dogs and other foods.  MLE co-founder George Shea said the company tried to accommodate Chestnut and his management team, which included allowing him to compete in a rival unbranded hot dog eating contest on Labor Day. \u201cIt\u2019s a long-standing rule not to represent a rival brand,\u201d Shea said. \u201cMichael Jordan can\u2019t go to Adidas and say that Air Jordans are great.\u201d The MLE has also emphasized that Chestnut was not banned for life from competing, citing his 20-year relationship with the league.

{"id": "2024_06_11_media_pro-trump-media-hunter-biden-conviction", "text": "In the wake of Hunter Biden\u2019s conviction on federal gun charges Tuesday, right-wing media personalities sought to downplay the jury\u2019s decision, falsely claiming the case was a \u201cfake trial\u201d designed to \u201ccover up\u201d other supposed crimes committed by the president and his family. The reaction showcased how far to the fringes\u00a0the\u00a0right-wing and pro-Trump media\u00a0ecosystem has\u00a0drifted in recent years, with\u00a0high-profile personalities defaulting to\u00a0conspiracy theories\u00a0and\u00a0innuendo in response to\u00a0inconvenient political news. \u201cHunter Biden guilty. Yawn,\u201d right-wing talk show host Charlie Kirk wrote. \u201cThe true crimes of the Biden Crime Family remain untouched. This is a fake trial trying to make the Justice system appear \u2018balanced.\u2019 Don\u2019t fall for it.\u201d While right-wing figures and Republicans have long pushed the narrative that President Joe Biden has been involved in criminal activity, their claims have repeatedly fallen flat.\u00a0But the\u00a0reaction\u00a0rippled throughout the pro-Trump world\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0with\u00a0other far-right influencers and Trump-boosting Republicans echoing the\u00a0sentiment. \u201cThey went after Hunter on his gun stuff to make you overlook all his Ukraine stuff,\u201d Jack Posobiec,\u00a0the far-right conspiracy theorist\u00a0and Real America\u2019s Voice host,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign also\u00a0slammed\u00a0the verdict,\u00a0pushing\u00a0the conspiracy theory that the president had taken money from foreign governments. \u201cThis trial has been nothing more than a distraction from the real crimes of the Biden Crime Family, which has raked in tens of millions of dollars from China, Russia and Ukraine,\u201d the Trump campaign said a statement to CNN. \u201cCrooked Joe Biden\u2019s reign over the Biden Family Criminal Empire is all coming to an end on November 5th, and never again will a Biden sell government access for personal profit.\u201d There is\u00a0no evidence\u00a0Joe Biden has received large sums of money from China or has otherwise gained wealth as a result of his son\u2019s business dealings abroad. The former president\u2019s son\u00a0Donald Trump Jr.\u00a0also alleged in a live conversation on X that the younger Biden\u2019s trial was \u201cnot what it seems.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s trying to create that illusion of equal justice under the law,\u201d\u00a0he claimed.

The reaction stood in contrast to just last month when former President Donald Trump was convicted on all 34 counts in\u00a0the\u00a0New York\u00a0hush money trial. For\u00a0others\u00a0in the right-wing sphere, it\u2019s simple; Trump\u2019s case was a political hit job while Hunter Biden\u2019s case was a clear case of someone breaking the law. \u201cWe have gone over a cliff,\u201d Fox News host Jeanine Pirro said shortly after Trump was found guilty. \u201cThis is a new era in America, and I think it goes against the ilk of who we are as Americans and our faith in the criminal justice system.\u201d But\u00a0on Tuesday after the jury\u00a0delivered its\u00a0guilty verdict, Pirro\u00a0applauded the\u00a0Delaware\u00a0judge\u00a0-\u00a0a Trump appointee\u00a0-\u00a0for\u00a0her\u00a0handling of the Hunter Biden case. \u201cThis is a no-nonsense judge who took this case, showed America how a case worked and moved it right from opening statement to verdict,\u201d she said. Virginia Rep. Bob Good,\u00a0who leads the hard-right House Freedom Caucus,\u00a0offered a similar assessment. \u201cHunter Biden is convicted of an actual crime. Donald Trump was railroaded by a political prosecutor and a biased judge,\u201d\u00a0he posted on X. Meanwhile,\u00a0Mark Levin, the right-wing talk radio\u00a0personality\u00a0and Fox News weekend host, wrote that Biden was convicted \u201cin a real trial (not a farce like Manhattan).\u201d Still, other Trump boosting Republicans reacted with a\u00a0shrug\u00a0. \u201cThe Hunter Biden gun conviction is kinda dumb tbh,\u201d Florida GOP Rep. Matt\u00a0Gaetz\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/media/pro-trump-media-hunter-biden-conviction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_media_alex-jones-assets-sandy-hook", "text": "Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on Thursday moved to liquidate his personal assets, agreeing to demands from the families of Sandy Hook victims whom he owes more than $1.5 billion in damages over his lies about the 2012 school massacre. The seismic move paves the way for a future in which Jones no longer owns Infowars, the influential conspiracy empire he founded in the late 1990s. Over the years, Jones has not only used the media company to poison the public discourse with vile lies and conspiracy theories, but also to enrich himself to the tune of millions of dollars. Prior to Thursday, Jones had resisted converting his personal bankruptcy into a Chapter 7 liquidation. But facing mounting legal pressure, he reversed course and caved to the demands of the Sandy Hook families, who have still not seen a penny from Jones since juries in Connecticut\u00a0and Texas\u00a0found him liable in 2022 for defamation and emotional distress. His lawyers said in a filing that there was \u201cno reasonable prospect for a successful reorganization\u201d and that continuing down the path would only result in additional expenses incurred by Jones. The legal maneuver ultimately \u201cmeans [Jones\u2019] ownership in Free Speech Systems is going to get sold,\u201d Avi Moshenberg, an attorney who represents some of the Sandy Hook families, told CNN on Thursday night, referencing the parent company of Infowars. \u201cConverting the case to Chapter 7 will hasten the end of these bankruptcies and facilitate the liquidation of Jones\u2019s assets, which is the same reason we have moved to convert his company\u2019s case to Chapter 7,\u201d Chris Mattei, another attorney representing Sandy Hook families, told CNN. Jones technically has not controlled the Infowars business for some time, given that Free Speech Systems has also filed for bankruptcy protection. The company\u2019s business has, thus, been under the supervision of a court appointed restructuring officer. A hearing is scheduled for next Friday to determine the fate of Free Speech Systems\u2019 bankruptcy. But regardless of what happens in that case, Thursday\u2019s legal move sets the stage for a court-appointed trustee to liquidate\u00a0Jones\u2019 personal assets, which includes his stake in Infowars. The liquidation of Jones\u2019 assets does not mean that Infowars will cease to exist. Several outcomes are possible. The court-appointed trustee could sell the business to another owner, for instance.

{"id": "2024_06_11_business_chiquita-banana-liable-paramilitary-group-colombia", "text": "A Florida jury on Monday found banana company Chiquita Brands International liable for financing the Colombian paramilitary group Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC). The jury in the civil case, in federal court in the Southern District of Florida, found that \u201cChiquita knowingly provided substantial assistance to the AUC to a degree sufficient to create a foreseeable risk of harm to others.\u201d Chiquita, one of the world\u2019s largest banana producers, has been ordered to pay a total of $38.3 million to the families of eight victims of the AUC, which was a far-right paramilitary group that was designated a terrorist organization by the US. The group disbanded in 2006, according to Stanford University\u2019s Mapping Militants Project. In an amended Florida lawsuit, which was filed in 2008, the plaintiffs alleged payments from Chiquita to the AUC propped up the paramilitary group\u2019s violence in Colombia and that the company should be held liable for the group\u2019s murders. In a statement to CNN, Chiquita said it planned to appeal to jury\u2019s verdict.  \u201cThe situation in Colombia was tragic for so many, including those directly affected by the violence there, and our thoughts remain with them and their families. However, that does not change our belief that there is no legal basis for these claims,\u201d the company\u2019s statement said. \u201cWhile we are disappointed by the decision, we remain confident that our legal position will ultimately prevail.\u201d Searcy Law, a law firm representing AUC victims and their families, applauded Tuesday\u2019s decision in a press release. \u201cThe verdict sends a powerful message: corporations will be held accountable when business decisions prioritize profits over human lives,\u201d\u00a0Searcy Law said. The lives of the victims were devastated as a result of violence by AUC, Searcy Law said. CNN has reached out to the victims\u2019 families. In 2007, Chiquita pleaded guilty to making over 100 payments to the AUC totaling over $1.7 million despite the group being designated a terrorist organization. Chiquita recorded the AUC payments as \u201csecurity services,\u201d though the company never received any actual services from these payments, according to a US Justice Department press release from the time. The company agreed to pay the US government a $25 million fine, the US said in its release. An unnamed company executive had told the Justice Department that the payments had been made under the threat of violence, according to the release. However, the Florida jury ruled that Chiquita failed to \u201cact as a reasonable businessperson would have acted under the circumstances.\u201d \u201cChiquita\u2019s claim that it was forced to support the terrorists because it was itself the victim of extortion was a defense expressly rejected by the jury,\u201d Searcy Law said. Searcy Law attorney Victoria Mesa-Estrada\u00a0said the verdict is a wake-up call for businesses to \u201cre-evaluate their operations and ensure they are not even indirectly supporting violence or human rights abuses.\u201d In a social media post, Colombia\u2019s president, Gustavo Petro, reacted to the American jury\u2019s Tuesday decision and asked why the same ruling was not made in his home country. \u201cWhy could US justice determine in judicial truth that Chiquita Brands financed paramilitarism in Urab\u00e1? Why couldn\u2019t Colombian justice?\u201d he said in a post on X translated from Spanish.  This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_06_03_economy_detroit-michigan-central-station", "text": "For more than 35 years, Michigan Central Station has lain dormant, towering above Detroit\u2019s Corktown neighborhood as a harsh and stoic reminder of the city\u2019s economic pain. The 18-story monolith that at one point was the tallest railroad station in the world had fallen derelict, its once opulent halls tattooed with graffiti, stripped for parts, and left scorched and broken. Ronald Butler, who had a 20-year career with the Detroit Fire Department, recalled responding to fires there after it closed in 1988. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been known as the busiest firefighting department in the country,\u201d Butler said. \u201cA lot of that was from buildings being burned by people who needed to get out of a property or burn a property for insurance.\u201d \u201cThere was a sense of hopelessness,\u201d he added. When Detroit became the largest municipality to go bankrupt in 2013, it had fallen hard from its glory days of the early to mid 20th century, when Henry Ford\u2019s arrival and creation of the first-ever moving assembly line vaulted the city into a manufacturing hub and the automotive capital of the world. Now, Michigan Central Station, the neighboring old Book Depository and Butler himself are all symbols of hope for Detroit\u2019s future and its ongoing economic resurgence. Last year, the rehabbed depository was opened to house a blossoming batch of mobility and energy startups, including one helmed by Butler, who started Energy Storage Safety Products International, which makes fire mitigation and prevention technologies for lithium ion batteries. Michigan Central Station will reopen on Thursday, following a six-year renovation and nearly $1 billion of investment from the Ford Motor Company and its founding family. The historic building\u2019s rebirth as a mixed-used property (with offices, a hotel and, eventually, restaurants and retail) anchoring an innovation-focused district will be celebrated with a blockbuster concert Thursday night. \u201cCorktown is a very vibrant neighborhood, it\u2019s the oldest neighborhood in Detroit, but there was 30 acres, including this incredible old train station that was literally sitting abandoned and looming over the city as a reminder of the rise and fall of Detroit,\u201d said Mary Culler, a longtime Ford executive and director of the Michigan Central Station innovation district. \u201cIt was a massive project and needed some incredible vision; but \u2026 when I think about what Ford has committed here, it really is incredible, because it is bringing back an asset to the city, along with the 30 acres around it, that is going to be incredibly vibrant,\u201d she added. \u2018You had to fix the place up\u2019 The renewed Michigan Central comes at a critical time in Detroit\u2019s economic recovery, which as been more than a decade in the making, said Kevin Johnson, president and chief executive officer at the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation. The city has come a long way since July 18, 2013, when Detroit was the largest municipality in US history to file for bankruptcy after years of declining revenue, population losses, rising crime, a national financial crisis, automaker struggles and political corruption. \u201cAny city worth its own salt has a vibrant downtown that pumps the blood into the neighborhoods that it needs in order for the revitalization in the neighborhoods to start taking place,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s been a theme in Detroit since 2013. Right when the bankruptcy happened, philanthropic, corporate, neighborhood groups, outside investors began to look at Detroit as a [growth] opportunity, versus an opportunity to close it out and close it down.\u201d And it started with the basics: repairing sidewalks, turning back on streetlights, revitalizing the riverfront, coordinating trash pickup, demolishing homes that were left abandoned, razing industrial facilities that had fallen into ruin. \u201cThe fundamentals of running a city was the core of what started this revitalization,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had to fix the place up.\u201d A resurgence within the automotive industry and Detroit\u2019s \u201cBig Three\u201d helped boost those efforts, Johnson said. \u201cThe automotive industry began to recreate itself into a new and powerful job creator for Detroit,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a demand from the Big Three that we want you as close to our production base as possible, and that gave rise to those suppliers taking some of those old abandoned facilities and regenerating them.\u201d The economic data speaks volumes of that long road back: The city is adding jobs, generating revenue and, for the first time in decades, adding population. As of April, Detroit\u2019s unemployment rate was 3.8%, a tick better than the US overall rate of 3.9%, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. \u201cI look at the unemployment rate to gauge the overall health of the labor market, which I think is an indicator of how the general economy is faring,\u201d said Charles Dougherty, senior economist at Wells Fargo. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty low, and has been low over the past few years.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to say that Detroit is fully on its way to a robust period of economic growth, but there are early indications that Detroit is at the beginning stages of mounting a comeback.\u201d Residents like Butler have had a front row seat to the resurgence. \u201cWhat you look for are cranes in the skylines, and now you see them everywhere, and it\u2019s a beautiful thing because it\u2019s something positive for the city.\u201d he said. \u201cBut, ostensibly, it took for [the bankruptcy] to happen in order to get the investments and get people coming in and seeing the high upsides of the city.\u201d He added: \u201cBut now you see it everywhere, and it\u2019s nowhere more apparent than here at Michigan Central.\u201d Creating beauty from blight The resurrection of Michigan Central Station was no small feat. \u201cIt was the most infamous symbol of Detroit\u2019s decline, the international poster child of \u2018ruin [photography],\u2019\u201d Dan Austin, Michigan Central\u2019s spokesperson who has long chronicled the city\u2019s architectural history on HistoricDetroit.org. Fifteen years ago, the station was the bleak and blighted backdrop for rap artist and native son Eminen\u2019s music video for \u201cBeautiful,\u201d a song about his struggles with drug addiction. The video began with the phrase, \u201cIn 1950, Michigan was 1 of 8 states in America that collectively produced 36% of the world\u2019s GNP. Detroit was the greatest manufacturing city in the world.\u201d When Ford bought Michigan Central Station in 2018 for $90 million, Chairman Bill Ford told CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow at the time that the building\u2019s decay was \u201clike a knife through my heart.\u201d The vision was to restore the building to its prior state of grandeur, outfit the ground floor with restaurants and retail \u2014 similar to the refurbishment of Denver\u2019s Union Station \u2014 and place offices and a hotel in the stories above. The neighboring building and surrounding acreage would be complementary to the task of creating a high-tech innovation district hubbed by Ford. During the past six years, more than 3,000 skilled tradespeople spent a combined 1.7 million hours to meticulously renovate the building. That painstaking work (including 450 hours dedicated to the hand-carving of a Corinthian column framing the main entrance) involved Ford Motor Company reopening an Indiana quarry that served as the source for the original limestone. \u201cThe amount of love poured into this thing, the attention to detail getting it right \u2026 I don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s ever been a restoration project of this scale,\u201d Austin said. When Michigan Central Station officially reopens this Thursday \u2014 with a sold-out concert produced by Eminem and boasting a lineup of Detroit performers including Diana Ross and Jack White, according to an announcement Monday \u2014 it will serve as the second act of Ford\u2019s billion-dollar innovation district. Last year, the neighboring Book Depository building was reopened as Newlab at Michigan Central, a tech hub for startups and early stage companies. Nearly 100 firms operate there today, including many bridging the energy, mobility and manufacturing sectors. The projects under way include developing streets that charge electric vehicles, robots that can handle last-mile deliveries and a \u201cGoogle Maps for drones.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really grown into an extraordinary and thriving ecosystem,\u201d said Josh Sirefman, CEO of Michigan Central Station. And with Michigan Central Station coming online, that\u2019s only expected to grow. \u201cThat\u2019s the poetry of those catalytic investments by Ford into physical assets that were symbols of both a past time and then of decline,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re the epicenter of this work that is positioning Detroit once again as a leader.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/economy/detroit-michigan-central-station/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

Discovery, CNN\u2019s parent company, announced Tuesday a 10-year deal to become the new US home for the French Open tennis tournament beginning in 2025, a move that underscores how live sports remain a draw for cable networks in the age of cord-cutting. Under the \u201cnew expansive deal,\u201d all roughly 900 matches will air live on the streaming platform Max, with featured matches on TNT and TBS and a new whip-around show on truTV. Bleacher Report and House of Highlights will become digital hubs for the prestigious two-week tournament, which begins yearly in late May. Variety first reported the deal on Friday. \u201cRoland-Garros perfectly aligns with our global sports strategy and our commitment to adding premium live sports content to our TNT Sports portfolio,\u201d said Luis Silberwasser, Chairman and CEO, TNT Sports, in a release. Financial terms weren\u2019t publicly disclosed, but a source familiar with the deal confirmed to CNN that it\u2019s worth $650 million. The Athletic was first to report the cost of the deal. WBD already has an existing relationship with Roland-Garros since it began broadcasting the tennis tournament across Europe on Eurosport since 1989. The agreement makes WBD the \u201clargest global broadcast partner\u201d for Roland-Garros. NBC has largely aired the French Open since 1983, although its limited coverage of matches has angered loyal viewers. The Tennis Channel stepped in to air more matches in 2006, splitting the rights with NBC. TNT Sports noted that it will have an \u201con-site presence\u201d in Paris, including announcing teams with \u201cmultiple positions\u201d inside Roland-Garros. Commentators and studio anchors will be announced at a later date. Tennis has seen its popularity and ratings grow in the past few years, which could help WBD\u2019s sport portfolio. Although the NBA has been a centerpiece on TNT for 35 years, the cable network has been expanding with others sports including the NHL, MLB, most of the March Madness men\u2019s basketball tournament and college football. Also, truTV has pivoted to airing sports in primetime. WBD\u2019s deal with the NBA expires after next season. It could renew its deal, but NBC and Amazon have reportedly outbid WBD, according to the Wall Street Journal. A new agreement on which networks or platforms might get NBA rights, including a separate package that will likely continue at ESPN, will likely being announced in the coming weeks.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/media/french-open-tnt-wbd-rights/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

OPB called Smolkin a forward-thinking journalist and a strong business strategist who can help lead the 100-year-old public media organization through a difficult environment for the journalism industry \u2013 and public media, in particular. \u201cAs we celebrated our first 100 years, we were looking for a dynamic leader to chart the way forward during this time of transformational change in media,\u201d said Rukaiyah Adams, chair of OPB\u2019s board of directors. \u201cRachel will advance our work with deep experience in journalism, wide professional networks and adaptive leadership skills.\u201d Smolkin joined CNN in 2014 to lead politics coverage for CNN Digital. She was instrumental in transforming CNN\u2019s digital news coverage for the modern era, in which media consumers are getting information from multiple platforms and mobile devices. Over the past several years, Smolkin\u2019s purview grew to include national, international, business and live news for CNN Digital. She also spearheaded an innovative approach to US election coverage that provided CNN\u2019s audience with up-to-the-minute news about races across the country, no matter what screen or technology they used.  \u201cRachel has been an exceptional leader and partner, recruiting and supporting talented, diverse journalists across the network,\u201d said Virginia Moseley, CNN\u2019s executive editor, in a memo to staff. \u201cShe\u2019s helped develop our breaking news brand, emphasized service journalism, and made explainers and fact checks a core part of our storytelling.\u201d Smolkin takes over OPB at a challenging time for the industry. The digital and broadcast advertising markets that helped fund media organizations have shrunk sharply over the past several years, as people shift their news consumption habits to social media apps and other nontraditional sources. Artificial intelligence, a once far-off threat, has made stunning advances in recent years that also threatens to upend the business model of traditional journalism. CNN, like other media companies, has been challenged by the same disruptions. CEO Mark Thompson, who joined the network in 2023, outlined a plan in January to change the company for the future, urging the company to \u201crecapture some of the swagger and innovation of the early CNN.\u201d OPB\u2019s contributions from donors have grown over the past decade. But the broadcaster and Smolkin, who completed a master of business administration degree from the University of Virginia\u2019s Darden School of Business while she was an executive at CNN, suggested that OPB needed new creative thinking to ensure it can serve its audience\u2019s needs in the future. \u201cI am honored to lead OPB in its next chapter serving Oregon and the Pacific Northwest,\u201d Smolkin said. \u201cI am energized by the commitment the board has shown for building news and public affairs programming for all Oregonians and Southwest Washingtonians, for leading conversations about solving our most urgent challenges and for innovating new ways to connect with communities.\u201d Smolkin will replace Steve Bass, OPB\u2019s CEO since 2006, who announced his retirement last year. She will begin her new role in September. Before joining CNN, Smolkin worked at Politico, USA Today and the American Journalism Review. The announcement comes on the heels of the departure of Sam Feist, the longtime Washington bureau chief and senior vice president, who will become the CEO of C-SPAN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/media/rachel-smolkin-oregon-public-broadcasting/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

The Nationwide Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU) said last week that its 28,000 members \u2014 just under a quarter of the company\u2019s total workforce in the country \u2014 would stage a one-day strike on June 7, following failed negotiations over pay and bonus arrangements. The union asked its members to take a day off on Friday, which falls between a public holiday on Thursday and the weekend. Son Woomok, a union leader, told CNN that \u201cmany employees used their annual leave today,\u201d and at one site \u201call workers had taken leave so replacement personnel were deployed.\u201d He did not provide other details. He had previously said many NSEU members work for Samsung\u2019s flagship semiconductor unit. That division is trying to regain its former status as a top semiconductor company, according to Reuters, which says Samsung has fallen behind its competitors SK Hynix\u00a0and Micron Technology\u00a0in delivering chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) processors. A Samsung spokesperson told CNN that, \u201cthere is no impact on production and management activities\u201d as a result of the one-day walkout. \u201cToday\u2019s annual leave use rate is lower than last year\u2019s Memorial Day holiday\u2019s annual leave use rate,\u201d the spokesperson added. The world\u2019s biggest memory chipmaker has had a rough few years. A historic\u00a0shortage\u00a0of computer chips during the Covid\u00a0pandemic\u00a0was followed by falling demand last year as consumer appetite for electronics remained weak because of global economic uncertainty. But things are looking up for the company because of the AI boom. It is optimistic about a resurgence in demand for mobile devices this year, particularly with the rollout of new products, such as AI-powered smartphones. Last month, Samsung reported a more than\u00a0tenfold rise\u00a0in first-quarter operating profit amid forecasts of high demand for AI and high-end chips, an area in which it competes with Intel (INTC) and Taiwan\u2019s TSMC.

In May, Israel banned the\u00a0Qatari-based\u00a0news network from operating in the country for 45 days under a\u00a0sweeping\u00a0new wartime law that allows the Israeli government to ban\u00a0foreign\u00a0media organizations it deems \u201charmful\u201d to the\u00a0nation\u2019s\u00a0security.\u00a0Al Jazeera\u00a0condemned the move\u00a0as a \u201cdark day for democracy\u201d that sets a concerning precedent for other international media outlets operating in Israel. While the ban is not permanent and only valid during the declared period of war, the Israeli government can continue to\u00a0extend the closure for additional 45-day\u00a0periods. On Tuesday, a Tel Aviv District Court ruled that the ban on Al Jazeera could stand but was to be shortened to 35 days, meaning it will expire on Sunday. Al Jazeera said it was notified by the Israeli Ministry of Communications\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0that it intends to request that the government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approve another 45-day ban. Israel has claimed that Al Jazeera \u201charms Israeli security,\u201d and has a \u201cclose connection\u201d with Hamas, the militant group it is waging war against in Gaza. \u201cAl Jazeera reporters harmed Israel\u2019s security and incited against IDF soldiers. It is time to expel the mouthpiece of Hamas from our country,\u201d Netanyahu\u00a0said\u00a0last month. According to Reuters, a Tel Aviv District Court\u00a0judge\u00a0said Tuesday he had been presented evidence of the government\u2019s claims, but\u00a0the\u00a0evidence was not made public. Walid Omary, Al Jazeera\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief,\u00a0told CNN he had \u201ccynicism, sarcasm and contempt for the court\u2019s decision, and we reject all accusations and excuses.\u201d Last month, Israeli authorities raided\u00a0Al Jazeera offices in Jerusalem, seizing its\u00a0broadcast equipment\u00a0and\u00a0shutting down its operations.\u00a0The network\u2019s\u00a0channels were\u00a0removed from\u00a0Israeli cable and satellite providers and its website was\u00a0blocked\u00a0from within Israel. Weeks later, Israeli authorities also\u00a0seized equipment\u00a0from the Associated Press\u00a0that was used to broadcast the Gaza skyline, claiming the broadcast was\u00a0being provided to\u00a0Al Jazeera and endangered Israeli troops.\u00a0The move\u00a0sparked\u00a0swift condemnation, including from\u00a0press groups,\u00a0Israeli opposition leaders and the US government. Hours after the seizure, Israeli authorities returned AP\u2019s equipment and the\u00a0live\u00a0shot was back on air. Al Jazeera, one of the only networks to have a live, consistent presence from within the blockaded Gaza strip, has denied Israel\u2019s claims\u00a0that it is a threat to the country\u2019s security, calling the allegations \u201cdangerous and ridiculous.\u201d At least six of its staff members have been killed in Gaza since the war began. Earlier this week, the Israeli Supreme Court also heard arguments brought against the law by an Israeli civil rights association, which said among other arguments, that the law infringes on the right to freedom of expression, information and press in Israel. During the hearing, Justice Yitzhak Amit, the head of the panel of judges, said that \u201cthere is no doubt that there is a violation of freedom of expression here,\u201d\u00a0according to\u00a0the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.

{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_11_business_elizabeth-holmes-appeal", "text": "Lawyers for Elizabeth Holmes, the convicted Silicon Valley grifter, presented her appeal before a California court Tuesday, revisiting a case that exposed the shortcomings of the tech world\u2019s fake-it-till-you-make-it startup culture. Holmes was sentenced to 11 years in prison for defrauding investors in her failed blood-testing company, Theranos. She is seeking a new trial, arguing that the judge in her case erred in several decisions during the 2022 proceedings. Holmes is serving her sentence at a minimum-security facility in southern Texas and, as with most defendants, did not appear in court when California\u2019s Ninth Circuit heard her appeal. Since her conviction, her projected release date from prison has been moved up, shaving about two years off her sentence. Critical to the government\u2019s case against Holmes was convincing jurors that the Theranos founder not only knew her company\u2019s technology was flawed but went to great lengths to conceal it from investors. In their appeal, defense lawyers have homed in on what they see as the court\u2019s violation of evidentiary rules regarding one of the prosecution\u2019s key witnesses. Pushing back, prosecutors stated Tuesday that the lower court did\u00a0not err in its handling of the case and that\u00a0\u201cif there were any trial errors, they were harmless given the overwhelming and multifaceted evidence against Holmes.\u201d A decision on the appeal wasn\u2019t expected to come down immediately. Legal experts said the three judges are likely to consider the high-profile nature of the case and could take several weeks or months to issue a ruling. Theranos unravels Over the past decade, the story of Theranos \u2014 valued at $10 billion at its peak \u2014 has become a cautionary tale of tech-startup hubris and hype. It had all the hallmarks of a Silicon Valley juggernaut: A 19-year-old founder who dropped out of Stanford and dressed like Steve Jobs, an audacious mission to disrupt the medical establishment and lots of buzz among deep-pocketed investors such as Larry Ellison and Rupert Murdoch. The pitch was simple: Just one drop of blood, spun through Theranos\u2019 proprietary machine, could deliver faster, more accurate results than traditional testing that required whole vials drawn from a patient\u2019s veins. The trouble is, the tech never really worked, as a Wall Street Journal investigation revealed in a series of articles in 2015. Theranos\u2019 unraveling, and Holmes herself, became the subject of a bestselling book, a Hulu scripted series and an award-winning documentary. Federal prosecutors in 2018 charged Holmes and her former partner, Ramesh \u201cSunny\u201d Balwani, with running a multimillion-dollar scheme to defraud investors, doctors and patients. A jury ultimately convicted her on four counts of defrauding investors, but not guilty on the counts that pertained to defrauding patients. Holmes knowingly concealed the technology\u2019s problems, and still pushed to get the company\u2019s Edison devices into pharmacies, prosecutors argued. \u201cHolmes repeatedly told potential investors that major pharmaceutical companies had validated Theranos\u2019s device, and the US military was using it in the battlefield to treat wounded soldiers,\u201d lawyers for the government said in court filings. \u201cIn truth, Theranos\u2019s device could never complete more than 12 types of blood tests, often with less accuracy, less automation, and less consistency\u201d than conventional methods. And the devices were never used in war zones.  Balwani was convicted separately and sentenced to 13 years in prison. Prosecutors have sought to underscore the real-world implications of Holmes\u2019 and Balwani\u2019s lies to investors. In a filing to the appeals court, they note that one woman received results from Theranos\u2019 test indicated \u201cshe was going to have a miscarriage when she was carrying a healthy baby,\u201d the filing states. \u201cAnother received results indicating that he had late-stage prostate cancer when he did not. Another was informed (incorrectly) that she had HIV.\u201d An uphill battle Holmes\u2019 lawyers have said in court documents that the criminal trial was \u201cteeming with issues for appeal.\u201d Specifically, they focused on the testimony of Kingshuk\u00a0Das, the former lab director at Theranos, who testified during the trial that he found many problems with the Edison machines and that he believed they were \u201cunsuitable for clinical use.\u201d On Tuesday, Holmes\u2019 lawyer said Das\u2019 opinion about whether the technology worked was \u201cclassic expert opinion,\u201d given by someone who was not vetted as an expert witness in the case. Holmes has argued that Judge Edward Davila erred in his ruling that she could not refer to the testimony of Balwani, her former boyfriend and business partner, in her own defense. Her lawyers have argued that prosecutors\u2019 statements about Holmes\u2019 relationship with Balwani \u201cwould have probably led to Ms. Holmes\u2019 acquittal in a new trial.\u201d During Holmes\u2019 trial, the government characterized the pair\u2019s relationship as one between two co-equals, her laywers said in a 2022 filing. Then, in Balwani\u2019s trial, \u201cthe government took the opposite position and highlighted Mr. Balwani\u2019s age, experience, and influence over Ms. Holmes.\u201d Criminal appeals are always an uphill battle, and Holmes\u2019 case is no exception. \u201cThe issues that Holmes\u2019s legal team has raised\u2026are all issues that are difficult to win on appeal \u2014 it\u2019s difficult to win on issues when you\u2019re Monday morning quarterbacking the decisions made by the judge,\u201d said Agustin Orozco, a former federal prosecutor and a partner with the law firm Crowell & Moring. In prosecutors\u2019 filing to the court, Orozco notes, they frequently raise a \u201charmless error\u201d argument \u2014 essentially saying that even if the lower court did make mistakes,\u00a0\u201cit doesn\u2019t matter because the evidence is so overwhelming against Holmes.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/business/elizabeth-holmes-appeal/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_07_cars_china-war-of-words-byd-huawei-ev-intl-hnk", "text": "As profit margins get squeezed, temperatures are rising in the world\u2019s biggest car market. A tense exchange between two major Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers in recent days highlights the pressures they face as a price war in the industry intensifies. It all started on Saturday, when Yu Chengdong, the chairman of Huawei\u2019s smart car unit, implied that rival EV maker BYD is racing ahead because of low prices rather than the quality of its cars. \u201cCurrently, BYD is \u2026 number one in the rat race, because it has extremely low costs,\u201d he said at a public forum in Shenzhen. BYD, a carmaker Elon Musk once laughed at, overtook his Tesla (TSLA) at the end of last year as the biggest seller of electric vehicles on the planet. (Tesla regained its position\u00a0in the first quarter of this year, but they\u2019re neck and neck.) \u201cWe are not good at competing with ultra-low prices. Rather, we are good at competing with value, intelligence, luxury, comfort, safety, high quality, excellent and comfortable user experience,\u201d Yu added. While top executives from the EV industry often post on social media about a range of topics, including technology and advertising, they rarely name rival companies, especially when criticizing them. In recent months, a price war has escalated in China\u2019s hyper-competitive EV industry, with manufacturers battling for consumer attention with deep discounts or newer, cheaper models. The industry suffered a blow in May when US President Joe Biden\u00a0quadrupled tariffs\u00a0on electric vehicles from China to 100%, effectively sealing off one of the world\u2019s biggest passenger car markets. It also faces potential extra import duties from the European Union as soon as next week. Yu\u2019s comments about BYD have gone viral on Chinese social media and provoked a sharp retort from the EV giant. \u201cPersonally I have great respect for Huawei. But I feel that if Mr Yu can make fewer comparisons, either at press conferences or public forums, more people will like him, and Huawei\u2019s brand would also gain points,\u201d Li Yunfei, general manager of branding and public relations at BYD, said in a video post on Weibo on Thursday. Li pointed out that Huawei is also trying to \u201ccompete with low prices,\u201d as the company has made significant price cuts in the past year. \u201cWe welcome other brands to show their cars at our booth and compete with ours on the same stage,\u201d he added. On the same day, Wang Chuanfu, founder and chairman of BYD, said at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting that its core strength lies in \u201ctechnology and innovation.\u201d BYD will invest 100 billion yuan ($13.8 billion) in developing smart EVs in the future, focusing on generative artificial intelligence and large model technologies, Wang added. Earlier this week, BYD was among a group of nine automakers to receive a green light from the Chinese government for public trials of advanced auto driving. Competition in the world\u2019s largest EV market has become cutthroat. The country has more than 200 EV manufacturers who are grappling with huge oversupply and slowing consumer demand. A brutal price war kicked in last year, with even market leaders like BYD and Tesla rushing to cut prices to retain or expand their market positions. While deep price cuts by manufacturers and government subsidies for car buyers have boosted the volume of sales, overall profitability has fallen. Wang said earlier this year that a \u201cbrutal elimination round\u201d is coming for the industry, urging companies to form economies of scale and brand advantages \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/07/cars/china-war-of-words-byd-huawei-ev-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_business_raytheon-lawsuit-job-discrimination", "text": "A class action lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges that RTX Corporation, the multinational aerospace and defense systems giant formerly known as Raytheon Technologies, has been discriminating against job seekers who are 40 years or older. The complaint, filed by the AARP Foundation and two law firms at the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, asserts that the language used in certain Raytheon job ads indicates a preference for younger workers in violation of the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Massachusetts Fair Employment Practices Act and the Virginia Human Rights Act. The company had been headquartered in Massachusetts and recently relocated to Virginia. \u201cThe language and content of these job advertisements discourages and deters many older workers from even applying for the Recent Graduate Positions and prevents older workers who do apply from advancing in the hiring process because too much time has passed since they graduated \u2026 \u00a0and/or entered the workforce,\u201d the complaint said. The ads that refer to \u201cRecent Graduate Positions\u201d indicate that applicants should either have graduated from college or graduate school very recently or have no more than 12 or 24 months of related work experience. While the positions may be lower level, they are not necessarily low paying, with salary ranges that can run north of $100,000. In response, RTX rejected the premise of the allegations. \u201cRTX complies with all relevant age discrimination laws and we\u2019re committed to maintaining a diverse workforce. We believe these claims are entirely without merit and we will actively defend our hiring practices,\u201d company spokesman Chris Johnson told CNN. The suit currently has just one named plaintiff \u2014 Mark H. Goldstein \u2014 but is brought on behalf of \u201call others similarly situated.\u201d More named individuals may join the suit later, said Peter Romer-Friedman, one of the lead lawyers on the case. Goldstein, 67, has roughly four decades of experience in \u201cproject management, cybersecurity, technology, risk management, security engineering, sales, marketing, engineering, business, and consulting,\u201d according to the complaint. In addition, it said, Goldstein has experience as a contractor for the US Department of Homeland Security, has held a federal government security clearance and has two key information security and privacy certifications. Between 2019 and 2023, Goldstein applied to at least seven of Raytheon\u2019s recent graduate positions for which he met all the qualifications save those requiring the newness of his degrees or the short duration of work experience. \u201cDespite the fact that Mr. Goldstein has been genuinely interested in a position with Raytheon, committed to relocating, if necessary, and has skills that Raytheon needs to address a years\u2019 long labor shortage, Raytheon has not hired Mr. Goldstein for any of the positions to which he applied, has never offered him an interview, and has failed to seriously consider Mr. Goldstein\u2019s applications based on his age,\u201d the complaint said. Goldstein had filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2019. In 2021, the EEOC declared in a letter that its \u201cinvestigation revealed that [Mr. Goldstein] was denied the opportunity to be considered for the [Recent Graduate Positions] he had applied for because of his age, and not because he did not meet the minimum qualifications required for the jobs,\u201d according to the complaint. \u201cIt also found that Raytheon\u2019s discriminatory advertisements had violated the ADEA, explaining that: \u2018EEOC believes [Raytheon\u2019s] job advertisements included language that violates the ADEA in that it indicated a hiring preference for applicants who are not in the protected age group.\u2019\u201d In response to the EEOC\u2019s 2021 determination, Raytheon tweaked some language in job ads, but in ways that still discriminate against older job seekers, the complaint alleges. Goldstein filed a second charge of discrimination with the EEOC in July 2023. The agency is still investigating that matter, Romer-Friedman noted.

{"id": "2024_06_11_tech_apples-ai-tools-preview", "text": "Apple is about to throw artificial intelligence into the mainstream, but some of it is similar to what its competitors are already doing. In a demo following Tuesday\u2019s annual Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple gave CNN a preview of some of the AI-powered features coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac in the fall. Powered by what the company is calling \u201cApple Intelligence,\u201d some of the tools highlight a new era for the company; others remind us they\u2019re just playing catch up. Still, for many, this will be the first time interacting with generative AI \u2013 the buzzy form of artificial intelligence that can provide seemingly thorough responses to questions \u2013\u00a0in a way that will affect their everyday lives. The biggest change coming to Apple devices is a modernized, much smarter Siri, potentially turning the company\u2019s virtual assistant with a hit-or-miss track record into a more reliable, personalized chatbot. On the other hand, however, other AI tools look familiar from what we\u2019ve seen on the market. And the very first iteration of Siri, launched in 2011, came with similar prognostications, only to fall relatively flat in the cultural zeitgeist. Apple Intelligence, for example, will help spot typos or grammar mistakes in emails, similar to a spellchecker or services like Grammarly, or turn a casual draft into one with a more professional tone (much like Microsoft\u2019s AI software Copilot). It\u2019ll also offer the ability to circle and remove distractions in photos (akin to Google Pixel\u2019s Magic Easer). And it can also enable the production of AI-generated images from sketches (similar to Samsung Image Wand). Apple is often not the first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies. The company typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products. Yet the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI perhaps expedited the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the latest tech industry bet and finally show off what it\u2019s likely been working on behind the scenes for years. Catering to pro users Users of only Apple most\u2019s powerful (and therefore expensive) devices will be able to use the AI tools \u2013 this includes the iPhone 15 Pro or Mac with a M1, M2 and M3 processor. The rollout could also entice consumers to upgrade their devices at a time when they\u2019ve been holding onto older models longer. Ahead of the demo, the company emphasized that the majority of the new tools are powered by Apple Intelligence. Its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI only comes into play in a limited, specific way (more on that soon). In the demo, Apple discussed how writing tools with AI can be used to tighten cover letters and suggest changes, or change the tone of an email, rework sentence structure or catch typos. If you want your email to sound more professional, or more friendly, Apple says its AI will take a stab. While using the Notes app, you could ask for a summary of a meeting or school lecture. In the Photos app, it\u2019s possible to remove something or someone out of a picture you no longer want there, using a quick tap. Apple also walked us through creating customized photos that could be sent in messages, such as the Golden Gate Bridge with fireworks in the background, or creating a birthday party invitation with a custom picture of a dinosaur on a surfboard. It\u2019s easy to see how this, along with Genmoji \u2013 Apple\u2019s custom AI-generated emoji that uses your likeness against different backgrounds \u2013 will bring new methods of communication into texting and interacting with others. Siri\u2019s AI flex Apple really flexes its AI muscle, however, when it comes to Siri, which Apple says is taking a massive step forward by becoming more contextually relevant and more personal. In the demo, an Apple executive asked Siri to set an alarm for 5:30 am and then changed her mind to 5:45 am. Siri obliged without a fumble. In Messages, Siri will know what you\u2019re discussing in case a question comes up. For example, if you\u2019re chatting with someone about tennis player Roger Federer, you can ask Siri how many games he\u2019s won without ever saying his name out loud. When you have a question that\u2019s beyond Siri\u2019s scope, ChatGPT can step in. In the demo, Apple showed how someone could upload a picture of vegetables at a farmer\u2019s market and ask what they could make for dinner. Siri could offer that this is a question better suited for ChatGPT, and ask the user if they consent to using the service. Although the partnership is limited for now, some analysts say it makes sense for the company to grow its own proprietary technology and fill in the gaps with ChatGPT in the meantime. Apple could either scale back or grow its partnership with OpenAI over time, but using it in a limited capability could potentially cut down on risks associated with the company. OpenAI, along with other AI companies, continue to face concerns around misinformation, biases, copyright, privacy and security, and more. It also comes at a time when the\u00a0industry is moving so quickly and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use the technology responsibly. During its presentation, Apple also emphasized privacy and security, noting most AI functions will be done on the phone, keeping inputs away from a far-off server cloud. While the market didn\u2019t seem to respond immediately to Apple\u2019s announcements on Monday, with its stock price (AAPL) dipping slightly, the company\u2019s stock rose more than 7% on Tuesday. Although these are only Apple\u2019s first steps into what tech giants are desperately hoping is a brave new world, it\u2019s now poised to be a player in the ever-growing AI arms race.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/tech/apples-ai-tools-preview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_economy_fed-inflation-when-rate-cut", "text": "Legendary baseball coach and player Frank Robinson famously said, \u201cClose only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.\u201d The Federal Reserve is living by that precept. After getting its preferred inflation gauge down from over 7% in June 2022 \u2014 its highest level since the early 1980s \u2014 to its current reading of 2.7%, you\u2019d think central bankers would be breathing a sigh of relief. And yet, they\u2019re likely doing anything but that at their June two-day monetary policy meeting, which kicks off on Tuesday. Officials are all but certain to leave rates unchanged regardless of the forthcoming May Consumer Price Index report set to be released Wednesday at 8:30 am ET, just hours before the Fed\u2019s decision is announced. \u201cOf course we\u2019re not satisfied with 3% inflation,\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters after last month\u2019s policy meeting, adding that \u201c3% can\u2019t be in a sentence with satisfied.\u201d Powell and his colleagues at the Fed will not budge on 2%. And until they\u2019re convinced inflation is on a sustainable path to that level, rate cuts won\u2019t be on the table \u2014 unlike many central banks abroad that have recently begun the process. There are good reasons for the Fed\u2019s stubbornness, though. Public perceptions are key Former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke has gone as far as to say that \u201cmonetary policy is 98% talk and 2% action.\u201d That is to say that the Fed\u2019s ability to achieve 2% inflation is predominantly a byproduct of the public\u2019s belief that it will materialize. If people expect prices to rise by 3%, businesses would almost be foolish not to put forth price increases that meet what they\u2019re already anticipating. To afford those price increases, workers will likely demand wage increases on par. That makes it much harder for the Fed to get inflation down further. The expectation of 3% inflation is not merely hypothetical. Multiple surveys, including one by the New York Fed, indicate that people expect prices to rise by around 3% in the year ahead and upcoming years. If Fed officials become complacent with those expectations, they\u2019ll likely forfeit their ability to persuade them that they mean business when they say they want 2% inflation. That\u2019s why it is crucial for central bankers to insist on 2%. \u201cBy communicating an explicit inflation target \u2014 and then delivering inflation consistent with that target \u2014 central banks earn credibility with the public,\u201d New York Fed President John Williams said in a recent speech. \u201cThat helps anchor expectations, which, in turn, contributes to low and stable inflation.\u201d Inflation is moving in the wrong direction It would be one thing if the latest inflation reading showed it declined to 2.7% and there were signs pointing to more progress. But that hasn\u2019t been the case in recent months. April\u2019s Personal Consumption Expenditures price index didn\u2019t budge from March when prices accelerated to 2.7% from 2.5% in February. Additionally, inflation readings from the first quarter of this year put the nation\u2019s annualized inflation rate at 3.4%. \u201cThat number, fortunately, is nowhere near the 7.1% headline inflation we saw in June 2022 but does remind us that the job is not yet done,\u201d Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin said in a speech he gave last month. Stripping away highly volatile categories such as food and energy \u2014 a measure referred to as \u201ccore\u201d inflation \u2014 won\u2019t quell central bankers\u2019 concerns. That index is up 3.7% on an annualized basis for the first three months of the year. That\u2019s well above average readings for the second half of last year. The Fed can\u2019t ignore CPI Although CPI isn\u2019t the inflation gauge the Fed targets, central bankers don\u2019t write it off. That\u2019s because it tells an underlying story that inflation is pinching Americans at undesirable levels. It was, however, welcome news to Fed officials that Consumer Price Index-measured inflation fell to 3.4% in April from 3.5% in March. Yet Fed Governor Christopher Waller said last month that \u201cthe progress was so modest that it did not change my view that I will need to see more evidence of moderating inflation before supporting any easing of monetary policy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/economy/fed-inflation-when-rate-cut/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_tech_raspberry-pi-ipo-london-stock-exchange", "text": "Investors are snapping up the shares of a British maker of tiny computers after it went public on the London Stock Exchange Tuesday. Raspberry Pi stock soared as much as 40% in early trade before paring those gains slightly by 11.54 a.m. ET to trade at \u00a33.85 ($4.90), still about 38% above their listing price. The initial public offering (IPO) valued the startup at nearly \u00a3542 million ($689 million). The Cambridge-based company started life in 2012 as a commercial subsidiary of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, a charity founded four years earlier to promote computer science in schools. It has since become known as the maker of small but fully fledged computers that fit on a single board. Some of them cost as little as $35. These boards, some the size of a credit card, can be connected to bigger devices, such as a desktop screen, or used as components to power machines such as smart speakers and robots. To date, Raspberry Pi has sold more than 60 million computers worldwide, according to its website. Industrial customers, such as tech companies and manufacturers, buy more than 70% of its computers, with the devices cropping up in everything from high-tech farming systems to self-pouring beer taps. It sells the rest to education providers and computer science \u201centhusiasts,\u201d according to its website. In 2022, the University of Cambridge declared one of the company\u2019s computers \u2014 its cheapest, with a price tag of only $35 \u2014 the \u201cbest-selling computer to come out of the UK.\u201d A rare win for London\u2019s stock market The IPO raised \u00a3166 million ($211 million), making it Britain\u2019s second-biggest this year, according to data provider Dealogic. Raspberry Pi plans to invest the funds raised in developing its products and expanding its educational activities. The company\u2019s market debut is a boon for London\u2019s languishing stock market, which has seen several companies ditch it in recent years or choose New York to go public. That includes British chipmaker Arm (ARM), which notched the biggest IPO of last year globally when it listed on New York\u2019s Nasdaq in September. Eben Upton, the Cambridge University-educated co-founder and chief executive of Raspberry Pi, said in a statement Tuesday that \u201cLondon has the right caliber and sophistication of investor to support growing, ambitious technology businesses such as Raspberry Pi.\u201d The Raspberry Pi Foundation is the company\u2019s main shareholder, according to Raspberry Pi\u2019s IPO prospectus.

{"id": "2024_06_11_business_homeownership-costs-inflation", "text": "The price for owning a home is rising rapidly \u2013 and we\u2019re not just talking about mortgage payments. US homeowners are now paying an average of $18,118 a year on property taxes, homeowners\u2019 insurance, maintenance, energy and various other expenses linked to owning a home, according to a new Bankrate study. That\u2019s nearly the cost to buy a used car and represents a 26% increase from four years ago when it cost $14,428 annually to own and maintain a home. All of these variable expenses are on top of the fixed cost of a mortgage, including property taxes, homeowners insurance, energy costs, internet, cable bills and home maintenance. The findings are another reminder of how much more expensive life has become since Covid-19. Many Americans would like to buy a home but have been unable to because home prices have spiked to record highs and mortgage rates remain elevated. The housing market is historically unaffordable. But even the ones fortunate enough to have bought a home over the past few years are grappling with sticker shock over the cost of maintaining it. The per-month cost of owning and maintaining a home has gone from $1,202 a month in 2020 to $1,510 now, Bankrate found. Jeff Ostrowski, analyst at Bankrate, told CNN that the main drivers of the spike in homeownership expenses are the cost of maintenance and insurance. Home insurance premiums have surged in recent years, in part because of extreme weather. \u201cMy homeowners insurance doubled, with no notice \u2013 nothing,\u201d said Jennifer Schauer, who bought her home in Novato, California, in 2021. Schauer said some of her neighbors lost their homeowners insurance coverage altogether because of the mounting threat of wildfires in the region. \u201cMy neighbors said I was lucky our insurance just doubled and it wasn\u2019t canceled,\u201d she said. Home insurance rates jumped 11.3% nationally last year alone, according to S&P Global. The US homeowners insurance industry lost $101.3 billion last year as severe storms, hurricanes and wildfire did significant damage. And high inflation made it that much more expensive to rebuild properties. Schauer, who has two children and works in a high school as a paraeducator, also recently found out her home needs $10,000 worth of plumbing repairs. \u201cThe housing market was so competitive when we bought, that to get this house we waived the homeowner inspection. We bought it as is,\u201d she said. \u201cWe knew the plumbing was old but it\u2019s falling apart.\u201d To make ends meet and deal with the unexpected costs of homeownership, Schauer is taking on extra hours at school as a substitute teacher, accepting help from family to pay for her son to get tutored and cutting costs by avoiding eating out and canceling her home cleaning service. Schauer isn\u2019t alone among Californians grappling with high hidden costs of homeownership. The average cost of owning and maintaining a home in California is $28,790, according to Bankrate, second among all US states behind only Hawaii. The top five is rounded out by Massachusetts ($26,313), New Jersey ($25,573) and Connecticut ($23,515). By contrast, Kentucky ($11,559), Arkansas ($11,692) and Mississippi ($11,881) had the lowest hidden costs of homeownership, according to Bankrate. Since Covid, the hidden cost of homeownership has climbed most rapidly in three states: Utah (44%), Idaho (39%) and Hawaii (38%). Of course, the silver lining for homeowners is the fact that home values have gone up significantly since 2020. Those gains have padded the net worth of millions of Americans. Median inflation-adjusted net worth swelled by 37% between 2019 to 2022, according to the Federal Reserve. The real estate boom also gives homeowners additional financial flexibility, letting them borrow against the value of their homes to pay for unexpected costs, finance the cost of education or upgrade their homes. Still, Ostrowski, the Bankrate analyst, said the findings should be a \u201creality check\u201d for first-time homebuyers. \u201cA lot of first-time buyers think of the closing table as the finish line,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in another way, it\u2019s just the starting line for all these new expenses you\u2019ll be responsible for.\u201d Ostrowski said buyers must budget for these hidden costs of homeownership when they are trying to determine how much they can afford to spend on a mortgage. \u201cYou may have thought you were done scrimping and saving when you got enough for a down payment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut once you own, you have to set aside money for these unexpected costs.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/business/homeownership-costs-inflation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

Wall Street is being dealt a rare double feature of economic news on Wednesday, when an inflation report is due in the morning and the Federal Reserve is expected to announce what it will do with its key interest rate in the afternoon. What to expect: Investors will parse the May Consumer Price Index report on Wednesday morning, just hours before the Fed is slated to announce its monetary policy update. The CPI report and Fed\u2019s policy meeting have fallen on the same day just seven times since 2014, according to Bank of America. Despite the rare event, it\u2019s unlikely the stock market will swing widely because of the economic two-fer, some investors say. \u201cThe things that could drive volatility higher would be if Chair Powell was to say something unexpected; I think that is of a very low probability,\u201d wrote Dave Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar, in a Monday note. But if \u201cinflation metrics come out much higher than expected, that could lead to a small sell-off. How much the market sells off would depend on how much above consensus inflation is running.\u201d The central bank is widely expected to keep rates on hold this month. Some analysts say upcoming CPI data won\u2019t alter the Fed\u2019s June decision, unless it shows a huge deceleration or acceleration in inflation. But the metric will still help guide the Fed\u2019s decisions during the second half of the year. \u201cThe number of rate cuts the Fed will actually be able to deliver this year will depend heavily on the outlook for inflation; if it remains stickier, investors may want to temper their expectations for easing for 2024,\u201d wrote Glenmede\u2019s investment strategy team in a Monday note. Inflation is coming down, but the path could be bumpy. Inflation showed signs of cooling in April after staying worryingly warm during the first quarter of this year. There are also signs that Americans are spending less: A second estimate of gross domestic product, released in May, showed that consumer spending was weaker in the first three months of the year than initially reported. Big-box retailers are cutting prices to entice price-conscious consumers. Investors are looking to the May CPI for clues about whether that cooldown in April\u2019s CPI report was a blip. Already, other metrics have suggested that inflation is still taking its time to come down. The April Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the central bank\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, showed the US economy made little progress keeping costs in check. US home prices are at record highs. Prices for used and new cars are still running hot, as are costs for insuring, repairing and maintaining them. The latest jobs report released Friday revealed that the US economy added an eye-popping 272,000 jobs in May. The combination of persistent inflation and strong job growth has led Wall Street to pare its expectations for rate cuts this year. Traders are expecting just one to two cuts in 2024, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The Fed on Wednesday will release its latest projections for where it expects rates to head in the future, and, importantly, how many times it expects to ease rates in 2024. Although the central bank has stuck to its forecast for three rate cuts so far this year, that could change \u2014 and potentially become the final set of 2024 projections. \u201cIf most of the [Federal Open Market Committee] participants assume only one 25 [basis point] rate cut this year is appropriate, there would appear to be little chance of sufficient data in time to pull them back into a July or September rate cut,\u201d wrote UBS economists in a Friday note. Americans are feeling rosier about their finances, the stock market and inflation\u2019s decline Presidential election polls may be showing that some Americans have mixed, if not outright sour, views on the overall economy \u2014 but when it comes to how they view their own finances, things are looking pretty good, reports my colleague Alicia Wallace. US consumers are more optimistic about their current and future financial situation, the stock market and slowing inflation, according to survey data released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The New York Fed\u2019s May Survey of Consumer Expectations showed improvement of people\u2019s perceptions of their current financial situation as well as their outlook for a year from now. The share of respondents who said their financial situation was better than in May 2023 was at its second-highest level in more than two years, while the year-ahead positive share landed at its highest level in nearly three years. Monday\u2019s survey also showed improved optimism beyond the homefront: Notably, consumers believe the markets\u2019 good times could keep rolling. Households\u2019 expectations for highest US stock prices improved to a three-year high. In terms of the labor market, the latest survey was a little mixed. Read more here. America\u2019s rural hospitals keep getting attacked by cybercriminals. Microsoft and Google are working to fix that Microsoft and Google will offer free or discounted cybersecurity services to rural hospitals across the United States to make them less vulnerable to cyberattacks that have disrupted patient care and threatened lives, the White House and those tech firms said Monday. Microsoft said in a statement to CNN that it would provide free security updates for eligible rural hospitals, as well as security assessments and training for hospital staff. Google will provide free cybersecurity advice to rural hospitals and start a pilot program to match the firm\u2019s cybersecurity services with the needs of rural hospitals. The nation\u2019s roughly 1,800 rural community hospitals are among the most vulnerable to dangerous ransomware attacks because they often lack IT security resources and cybersecurity-trained staff, report my colleagues Sean Lyngaas and Michelle Watson. And they may be the only hospitals within dozens of miles, meaning a ransomware attack that prevents a hospital from accepting ambulances can put patients\u2019 lives at risk. The new announcement is the result of private discussions between the tech firms and officials at the White House National Security Council which has grown increasingly concerned about cyber threats to hospitals. It\u2019s an effort to use the broad reach of Microsoft and Google\u2019s software, which is used in hospitals across the United States, to help plug a gap in the defense of the health care sector.

{"id": "2024_06_11_business_amazon-contract-workers-file-legal-claims", "text": "More than 15,000 Amazon contract drivers filed arbitration claims against the e-commerce giant on Tuesday, alleging Amazon classified them as independent contractors instead of employees with minimum wage and overtime rights. Millions of Americans participate in the \u201cgig economy,\u201d freelancing work through delivery and ride apps like Lyft, Uber, Doordash and Instacart. But as gig work has gotten more popular, many of those workers say they are in fact employees, not just contractors, and therefore deserve more benefits and protections. The definition and rights of a contract worker versus an employee, for example, has been fiercely debated in laws such as California\u2019s Prop 22, which allows ride-hailing and delivery drivers to be treated as independent contractors with some added benefits, including a minimum earnings guarantee. Amazon Flex, launched in 2015, allows independent contractors to sign up to deliver Amazon packages. Flex drivers provide Amazon Fresh grocery deliveries or same-day deliveries from the company\u2019s warehouse hubs. Since the drivers are classified as independent contractors, these claims ask for compensation for unpaid wages and overtime, and reimbursement for expenses such as mileage and cell phone usage. Lawyers for the case said in a statement that about 450 such claims had been previously filed with the American Arbitration Association. Drivers from California, Massachusetts and Illinois filed claims because laws about employee misclassification are \u201cvery clear\u201d in those states, attorney Steven Tindall told CNN. The three states also allow workers to file claims for expense reimbursement from employers, Tindall added. Tindall and another attorney, Joseph Sellers, have been collecting claims for years, Tindall said. In a statement, Amazon said Flex \u201cgives individuals the opportunity to set their own schedule and be their own boss, while earning competitive pay. We hear from most of the Amazon Flex delivery partners that they love the flexibility of the program, and we\u2019re proud of the work they do on behalf of customers every day.\u201d\u00a0On its website, Amazon says most drivers earn between $18 to $25 an hour. In their statement, Tindall and Sellers said Amazon only pays the drivers for a pre-determined \u201cblock.\u201d If a Flex driver books a three-hour block on the app, they only get paid for three hours, even if deliveries come in that take more time. Tindall told CNN that the workers filed independent arbitration claims instead of a class action lawsuit because drivers have to sign an agreement that forbids class action. \u201cArbitration, unfortunately, limits the drivers\u2019 pursuit of justice. So, we\u2019re left with little choice but to file almost 16,000 individual arbitration actions at once,\u201d Tindall said. CNN\u2019s Samantha Delouya contributed to this report.

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans.

According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_business_sunak-starmer-debate-uk-election", "text": "The UK Treasury has flatly contradicted Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s claim that its impartial officials had calculated that the opposition Labour Party would \u201cput up everyone\u2019s taxes by \u00a32,000.\u201d Sunak made the claim during a televised debate Tuesday ahead of July\u2019s election, as he and Labour leader Keir Starmer clashed on issues ranging from the cost-of-living and immigration, to the state of the National Health Service. \u201cIndependent Treasury officials have costed Labour\u2019s policies and they amount to a \u00a32,000 tax rise for every working family,\u201d Sunak said. The Conservative Party leader later repeated the claim. On the eve of the debate, James Bowler, the most senior civil servant in the Treasury, said officials in his department had not been involved in producing that number, contained in a Conservative Party campaign document. In a letter dated June 3, a copy of which was posted to X by senior Labour Party official Darren Jones, Bowler wrote that \u201ccivil servants were not involved in the production or presentation of the Conservative Party\u2019s document \u2018Labour\u2019s Tax Rises\u2019 or in the calculation of the total figure used.\u201d The campaign document claims that Labour would have to find \u00a338.5 billion ($49.2 billion) to meet all of its spending commitments, either borrowing the money or raising taxes by \u201c\u00a32,094 per working household over the next four years.\u201d It states that \u201calmost every costing contained here has been conducted by (the) Treasury.\u201d In his letter to Labour, Bowler said he had cautioned senior Conservative Party officials and advisers against suggesting that the \u00a338.5 billion figure was based on Treasury analysis. He said that \u201cany costings derived from other sources or produced by other organisations should not be presented as having been produced by the Civil Service,\u201d adding that he had \u201creminded Ministers and advisers that this should be the case.\u201d The Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) has since investigated Sunak\u2019s comments.  In a statement Thursday, it said it would not comment on whether the \u00a32,000 number was accurate or not, but added that someone hearing the claim \u2014 without reading the Conservative Party\u2019s full campaign document \u2014 \u201cwould have no way of knowing that this is an estimate summed together over four years.\u201d \u201cWe warned against this practice a few days ago,\u201d the statistics watchdog added. OSR chair Robert Chote had already written to party leaders on Tuesday, urging them to ensure that statistics are used in an \u201cappropriate and transparent\u201d manner during the election campaign and not in a way \u201cthat has the potential to mislead.\u201d Labour says Sunak \u2018lied\u2019 Opinion polls, meanwhile, are divided about who won the debate Tuesday. A YouGov snap poll of 1,657 viewers, showed 51% thought Sunak performed better, compared to 49% for Starmer. But in a poll of 1,153 viewers by market research firm Savanta, 44% gave the debate to Starmer, while 39% voted for Sunak and 17% were undecided. Bowler\u2019s letter could undermine Sunak\u2019s claim to lead with integrity \u2014 a pledge made when he became prime minister in October 2022 \u2014 as he battles a high-stakes election. Opinion\u00a0polls suggest the Conservatives are set to be booted from office, with Labour on course to win a UK election for the first time since 2005. In a statement Wednesday, Labour said Sunak had \u201clied eleven times to the British people\u201d about the party\u2019s tax plans. \u201cLabour will not raise taxes on working people. It\u2019s the Tories who have made \u00a371 billion of unfunded promises that will mean higher taxes and higher borrowing,\u201d the party wrote in an emailed campaign message. During the debate Tuesday, Starmer dismissed the \u00a32,000 ($2,560) figure as \u201cnonsense\u201d and said it was based on \u201cpretend\u201d Labour policies. A Conservative Party spokesperson said that its document on Labour\u2019s tax plans \u201cused clear Labour policies, their own costings or official (Treasury) costings using the lowest assumptions.\u201d In a statement shared with CNN, the spokesperson added: \u201cIt is now for Labour to explain which of the policies which were Labour policy no longer are Labour policy.\u201d \u2014 Luke McGee contributed reporting.

The coffee chain rolled out Tuesday a new \u201cPairings Menu,\u201d which combines a drink and a breakfast item for a discount, marking Starbucks\u2019 latest attempt to rev up spending after a disappointing quarter and entice customers worried about soaring fast food prices. The offer, available all day, comes in two options: For $5, a customer can order a tall iced or hot coffee or an iced or hot tea paired with a croissant.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_media_fox-corp-board-subpoena-smartmatic-lawsuit", "text": "Four Fox Corporation board members have been subpoenaed in voting technology company Smartmatic\u2019s $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News over its airing of 2020 election lies, alleging executives at the right-wing cable channel\u2019s parent company knew it was spreading false\u00a0claims. In a court filing Monday, Smartmatic subpoenaed the four board members \u2014 Anne Dias, Charles Carey, Roland Hernandez, Jacques Nasser \u2014 over\u00a0Fox News\u2019s repeated airing of bogus conspiracy theories that the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump. \u201cAccountability and responsibility do not stop with Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch,\u201d Smartmatic lead attorney Erik Connolly said in a statement. \u201cSmartmatic plans to pursue Fox\u2019s board members as well to determine why they allowed the company\u2019s most valuable asset, Fox News, to spread disinformation about the 2020 election.\u201d New York Judge David Cohen had previously ordered Fox Corporation to turn over documents related to the board members in the case. Rupert Murdoch, the right-wing media mogul who founded Fox Corporation, the parent company of Fox News, was\u00a0also deposed\u00a0late last year. A Fox spokesperson did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. Over the years, members of the Fox Corporation board\u00a0have opted to stay silent\u00a0as the right-wing network has faced controversy, ignoring questions from CNN and others over whether they condoned some of the offensive rhetoric on the channel. In a\u00a0previous filing, Smartmatic alleged the board members \u201cwitnessed Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch\u2019s control of Fox News; exchanged relevant emails that Smartmatic has used in depositions and will mark as trial exhibits; attended meetings during and after Fox News broadcast the defamatory publications; and discussed the 2020 election and the competitive threats Fox News faced to its brand.\u201d The subpoenas come after Cohen\u00a0ruled earlier this year\u00a0that Smartmatic could also move forward with its lawsuit against Fox Corporation in addition to Fox News, dealing a blow to Fox\u2019s corporate leadership, including the powerful Murdoch family. The\u00a0lawsuit, which was filed in New York State court in the wake of the 2020 election, accuses Fox News and some of the right-wing channel\u2019s hosts of intentionally lying about Smartmatic in an effort to mislead the public into the false belief that the 2020 presidential election was rigged for then-candidate Joe Biden. \u201cThey needed a villain,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cThey needed someone to blame. They needed someone whom they could get others to hate. A story of good versus evil, the type that would incite an angry mob, only works if the storyteller provides the audience with someone who personifies evil.\u201d \u201cWithout any true villain, defendants invented one,\u201d the lawsuit added. \u201cDefendants decided to make Smartmatic the villain in their story.\u201d Last year, Fox News reached a historic\u00a0$787 million settlement\u00a0with another voting technology company, Dominion Voting Systems, over the right-wing channel\u2019s lies about the 2020 election. Fox News has previously denied defaming anyone and claimed that Smartmatic\u2019s lawsuit is an assault on the First Amendment. \u201cWe will be ready to defend this case surrounding extremely newsworthy events when it goes to trial, likely in 2025,\u201d a Fox News spokesperson previously told CNN in a statement. \u201cAs a report prepared by our financial expert shows, Smartmatic\u2019s damages claims are implausible, disconnected from reality, and on their face intended to chill First Amendment freedoms.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/media/fox-corp-board-subpoena-smartmatic-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_business_boeing-sales", "text": "Boeing reported another weak month for new plane orders as it struggles to overcome questions about safety and production problems with its commercial jets. The company reported it took orders for only four new jets in May, all for the 787 Dreamliner, and none for the troubled 737 Max. That was down from even the modest orders of seven gross orders in April, and far below the order of 69 jets it reported in May 2023. So far this year it has taken gross orders for 142 jets, down 36% from the orders it took in the first five months of last year. The company did receive an order for 85 of its planned 737 Max 10 in March from American Airlines, accounting for the majority of its orders so far this year. But that model of the plane has yet to be approved by the FAA to carry passengers.  That order from American produced its only good month for sales since a 737 Max jet had a door plug blowout on a January 5 Alaska Airlines flight, raising questions about the safety of its manufacturing process, and prompting numerous federal probes. The FAA has placed limits on its rate of plane production as a result. Orders for Boeing jets have fallen sharply, for the most part, from the strong sales it reported in 2023, including a monthly record for orders in December, due to airlines\u2019 eagerness to expand their capacity to meet increased passenger travel demand. The company\u2019s deliveries to customers took an even bigger hit than orders in May. It delivered 24 jets in the month, matching the deliveries in April, but just less than half of the 50 planes it delivered in May of 2024. Year-to-date deliveries are down 36%. Deliveries are important to the company\u2019s financial results, since most of the money it gets from the sale of a plane comes at the time of delivery. Shares of Boeing, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, fell more than 3% on the report. Its shares are down about 30% so far this year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/business/boeing-sales/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_economy_oil-industry-profits-under-biden", "text": "Nearly four years ago, while campaigning in the runup to the last presidential election, Donald Trump warned that President Joe Biden would \u201cdestroy\u201d the oil industry. As Trump and Biden are set once again to face off in a presidential election, Trump has renewed claims that Biden\u2019s agenda has hurt energy producers, promising to hit rewind on Biden\u2019s environmental policies. But the oil and gas industry in the United States has thrived under the current president, even as the Biden administration has touted its efforts to transition away from fossil fuels and towards green energy sources. In the last three and a half years, US oil production \u2014 and oil and gas company profits \u2014 have broken records. The top five US-based oil and gas companies by market cap, according to S&P Global \u2014 ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), ConocoPhillips (CPP), EOG Resources (EOG) and Schlumberger (SLB) \u2014 have raked in more than $250 billion in profits between 2021 and 2023. That\u2019s a 160% jump compared to the first three years of the pro-big-oil Trump administration, according to calculations by CNN. The energy industry\u2019s recent profit windfall underscores the limited influence of any US president \u2014 whether in favor of fossil fuel or not \u2014 in the global oil and gas market. In Biden\u2019s case, many of the dynamics that supercharged oil and gas industry profits during his presidency were not directly related to his administration\u2019s policies: Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, a post-pandemic surge in travel demand and the proliferation of new technology that helped the US significantly increase its production of oil and natural gas all played a role, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service. \u201cOn balance, I think it\u2019s been a really, really good atmosphere for most [oil] companies,\u201d said Kloza. Boon for oil executives and shareholders According to the US Energy Information Administration, the US produced more crude oil than ever in 2023, beating the previous record set in 2019 \u2014 and Investors have been richly rewarded. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE), which tracks the performance of the largest oil and gas companies, is up more than 100% since Biden\u2019s inauguration. The cash-rich industry has not shied away from dealmaking. Last month, oil giant ConocoPhillips said it would acquire rival Marathon Oil in a deal valued at $22.5 billion. That acquisition comes on the heels of ExxonMobil\u2019s $60 billion purchase of Pioneer Natural Resources and Hess shareholders\u2019 approval of a $53 billion sale to Chevron. Over the last several years, big oil companies have used profits to purchase their own stock on the open market, lifting share prices. Notably, Chevron announced plans for a $75 billion buyback last year and Exxon said it would ramp up its annual pace of share repurchases to $20 billion per year. Chevron\u2019s major buyback package drew reproach from the Biden administration. \u201cFor a company that claimed not too long ago that it was \u2018working hard\u2019 to increase oil production, handing out $75 billion to executives and wealthy shareholders sure is an odd way to show it,\u201d said White House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan last year. Shareholders were also paid in the form of dividends. In 2023, ExxonMobil was the third-largest dividend payer in the S&P 500, behind only Microsoft and Apple, according to ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods. Many oil CEOs have also grown their own fortunes during the Biden administration. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth saw his compensation grow 17%, from $22.6 million in 2021 to $26.5 million in 2023. Exxon CEO Woods\u2019 compensation rose an eye-popping 56% in that span, from $23.6 million in 2021 to $36.9 million in 2023. Clean energy push \u2014 and pull In his first term, Trump overturned more than 100 environmental rules and actions put in place by the Obama administration.  In April, Trump allegedly promised oil industry executives that he would reverse some of Biden\u2019s climate policies in exchange for a $1 billion contribution to this reelection campaign, according to an exclusive report from The Washington Post. While climate advocates say Biden\u2019s record regarding the climate crisis and clean energy is mixed, Biden delivered on the largest climate investment in US history\u2014by far the biggest legislative win for the environmental movement since the Clean Air Act. On his first day in the White House, Biden revoked a permit that his predecessor, Trump, had granted to the controversial Keystone XL pipeline and placed a temporary moratorium on oil and gas leasing in the Arctic. \u201cThe era of supporting fossil fuels, even as a temporary bridge to a clean future, is over,\u201d Bob McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group told CNN at the time. Additionally, the Biden administration has taken steps to try to nudge the auto industry away from using gas-powered cars, like rolling out new tailpipe emissions standards and revamping electric vehicle tax credits. Earlier this year, Biden announced a temporary pause on approving several pending liquefied natural gas export projects, saying \u201cThis pause on new LNG approvals sees the climate crisis for what it is: the existential threat of our time.\u201d The energy industry has taken note. This year, members of the oil and gas industry have largely donated to Republican candidates and conservative groups, according to Open Secrets. However, in March, the Biden administration approved\u00a0ConocoPhillips\u2019 massive\u00a0Willow oil drilling project on Alaska\u2019s North Slope, which holds around 600 million barrels of oil, angering climate advocates. Despite his mixed record with oil and gas companies, though, Biden has presided over a historic run for the industry, Kloza said. \u201cThe oil industry in general, and this is true from the wellhead to the refinery to the gas pumps, is much, much more prosperous in the last 10 years than it was in any 10-year period prior,\u201d Kloza said. \u201cIt\u2019s just been a renaissance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/economy/oil-industry-profits-under-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_11_tech_elon-musk-drops-openai-lawsuit", "text": "Lawyers for Elon Musk on Tuesday moved to dismiss the billionaire\u2019s lawsuit against OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman, ending a months-long legal battle between co-founders of the artificial intelligence startup. Musk \u2014 who co-founded OpenAI in 2015 \u2014 sued the company in February, accusing the ChatGPT maker of abandoning its original, nonprofit mission by reserving some of its most advanced AI technology for private customers. The lawsuit had sought a jury trial and for the company, Altman and co-founder and president Greg Brockman to pay back any profit they received from the business. But OpenAI quickly pushed back against Musk\u2019s claims, calling them \u201cincoherent\u201d and \u201cfrivolous\u201d and arguing in a court filing that the case should be dismissed. The company also published a blog post that included several of Musk\u2019s emails from OpenAI\u2019s early days. The emails appeared to show Musk acknowledging the need for the company to make large sums of money to fund the computing resources needed to power its AI ambitions, which stood in contrast to the claims in his lawsuit that OpenAI was wrongly pursuing profit. Musk\u2019s lawyers did not cite a reason for their request to drop the lawsuit in Tuesday\u2019s filing. A hearing regarding OpenAI\u2019s motion to dismiss the case had been scheduled for Wednesday. The move to drop the lawsuit also came one day after Musk fired off a string of posts on his social media platform X criticizing OpenAI and its handling of user data, after Apple announced a partnership that integrates ChatGPT with digital personal assistant Siri for users on an opt-in basis. \u201cIf Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS\ufeff (operating system) level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies. That is an unacceptable security violation,\u201d Musk said in one post. (Apple said as part of its announcement that user queries sent to ChatGPT will not be stored by OpenAI.) The Musk-OpenAI legal battle represented the diverging visions for how the ChatGPT maker \u2014 which has quickly skyrocketed in value and become the leader in the burgeoning AI space that many see as the future of technology \u2014 should be managed. Musk accused OpenAI of racing to develop powerful \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d technology to \u201cmaximize profits.\u201d OpenAI, meanwhile, accused Musk of essentially being jealous that he was no longer involved in the startup, after he left OpenAI in 2018 following an unsuccessful bid to convince his fellow co-founders to let Tesla acquire it. But while OpenAI called Musk\u2019s claims \u201ca fiction,\u201d the billionaire is not the only person who has raised questions about OpenAI\u2019s leadership and direction. The company last year faced a high-profile leadership crisis that led to Altman\u2019s temporary ouster from the company, apparently over concerns by several board members about the\u00a0risks of artificial intelligence. After days of uncertainty and an intervention by Microsoft, a major investor in OpenAI, Altman was restored to his position in what industry analysts said was a victory for those seeking to commercialize AI technology. More recently, multiple high-profile OpenAI safety leaders exited the company, with several publicly claiming the company had prioritized quickly rolling out new products over safety. Weeks later, the company said it had established a new committee that would make recommendations to the company\u2019s board about safety and security.

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}

The Michigan Lottery announced a group called The Breakfast Club as the winner of an $842 million Powerball jackpot. The members, who have not been named, have decided to collect their prize as a lump sum of $305 million after taxes, the lottery announced at a Tuesday news conference. An attorney representing the lottery club spoke on their behalf but didn\u2019t say how many members are part of the group. \u201cThe club members have felt many emotions since realizing their ticket was the one,\u201d the group\u2019s attorney said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been elated and overwhelmed, thrilled and nervous. They\u2019ve gone from shock and sleepless nights to giving careful thought as to how this once-in-a-lifetime event will transform their lives.\u201d Group members plan to travel, prepare for retirement, be more charitable and look forward to \u201csharing our good fortune with immediate family by helping them realize their dreams,\u201d the club\u2019s attorney said. And while others would have been in line to collect their earnings the day after the winning numbers were announced, The Breakfast Club said they chose \u201cto take a more deliberate path and ensure we have the right team of advisers in place to help us decide the best way to move forward.\u201d The winning ticket was purchased at the Food Castle convenience store whose owners also received $50,000 in commission from the Michigan Lottery for selling the winning ticket. The family-owned store in Grand Blanc plans to donate the entire check to its employees and the community through charitable organizations, the family said. The Breakfast Club members are recipients of the sixth-largest Powerball prize ever won. The winning numbers were\u00a012, 21, 42, 44, 49 and Powerball 1. The Power Play multiplier was 3X.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/11/business/powerball-jackpot-winner-michigan/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/12/2024", "section": "business"}}
