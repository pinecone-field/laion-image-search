{"id": "2024_06_20_business_ai-jobs-workers-replacing", "text": "Corporate America is rapidly adopting artificial intelligence to automate work once exclusively done by humans. More than half (61%) of large US firms plan to use AI within the next year to automate tasks previously done by employees, according to a survey of finance chiefs released Thursday. Those tasks include everything from paying suppliers and doing invoices to financial reporting, said the survey conducted by Duke University and the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta and Richmond. That\u2019s in addition to creative tasks for which some businesses are already relying on ChatGPT and other AI chatbots to assist, including crafting job posts, writing press releases and building marketing campaigns. The findings show companies are increasingly turning to AI to cut costs, boost profits and make their workers more productive. \u201cYou can\u2019t be running an innovative company without seriously considering these technologies. You run the risk of being left behind,\u201d Duke finance professor John Graham, academic director of the survey, told CNN in a phone interview. The CFO Survey, a collaboration of Duke and the Atlanta and Richmond Fed banks, found that nearly one in three (32%) firms \u2014 large or small \u2014 plan to use AI in the next year to complete tasks once done by humans. Why bosses are deploying AI Some of this is already happening \u2014 especially among larger firms that have the financial firepower to experiment with AI. Nearly 60% of all companies (and 84% of large companies) surveyed said that over the past year they have already leaned on software, equipment or technology including AI to automate tasks employees previously did. The survey was conducted between May 13 and June 3. Bosses are turning to AI for a variety of reasons, including to trim what they are spending on human workers. The CFO Survey found that companies say they are using automation to increase product quality (58% of firms); increase output (49%), reduce labor costs (47%) and substitute for workers (33%). Still, the good news for workers is that some experts don\u2019t believe AI will cause mass job loss, at least not right away. \u201cI don\u2019t think there will be a lot of job loss in the year,\u201d said Graham. \u201cIn the short run, this will be more about plugging some holes and possibly not hiring someone they would have otherwise \u2014 but not laying someone off. In part that\u2019s because this is all-brand new.\u201d AI co-pilots on the way? Yet workers will feel the impact of AI adoption, if they aren\u2019t already. \u201cThis could give humans more time to prioritize what is most important and rewarding,\u201d said Graham. Reid Hoffman, the billionaire investor and co-founder of LinkedIn, told CNN that AI will likely disrupt some jobs but not in the immediate future. \u201cYears, not decades, but years, not months,\u201d Hoffman said, referring to the timing of AI displacing humans. \u201cI believe in three to five years, we\u2019ll all have kind of an agent co-pilot that\u2019s helping us with anything from how we cook dinner\u2026to doing your job and writing and so forth.\u201d Hoffman, who last year wrote a book called \u201cImpromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI\u201d with the assistance from ChatGPT-4, stressed that for a number of years it will be a co-pilot, not a pilot. \u201cIt\u2019s job transformation. Human jobs will be replaced \u2014 but will be replaced by other humans using AI,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole ideas is to be the human who is using AI, to learn it, to do it, to make it happen.\u201d AI and inflation For now, bosses and employees remain concerned about the cost of living and inflationary pressures. The CFO Survey found that inflation is the No. 2 concern for the next year among US chief financial officers \u2013 behind only the related concern of interest rates and monetary policy. Most CFOs (57%) expect the price of their products to increase this year at a faster-than-normal pace. However, there was a divergence in the inflation outlook based on technological adoption. The survey found that companies that implemented automation over the past 12 months expect slower price hikes than those that hadn\u2019t. Graham, the Duke professor, said that AI could eventually help moderate price increases but isn\u2019t optimistic it will be a major force to easing inflation right now. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like it will be the cure in the next year,\u201d he said. \u2018Significant risks\u2019 The CFO survey shows how fast companies are turning to AI \u2014 even as safeguards and regulatory frameworks are still being cobbled together. The rapid adoption of AI in some industries like finance has concerned some. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned in a speech earlier this month that the use of AI by financial companies poses both \u201ctremendous opportunities and significant risks.\u201d A report issued last week by Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, found that exiting regulation \u201cinsufficiently addresses\u201d how hedge funds are already using AI. The report warned that there are \u201cno regulations or requirements\u201d mandating \u201cwhen and whether a human must be involved in decision making, including related to trading decisions.\u201d Graham, the Duke professor, said it would be wise for companies in all industries to have strong risk management systems and redundancies in place as they experiment with AI. \u201cThere has been rapid adoption of AI,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope it\u2019s being done with a grain of salt. There will be some situations where companies have embarrassing products or supply chain situations because they moved a little too fast.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/business/ai-jobs-workers-replacing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_business_airbus-production-target-cut", "text": "Airbus cut its target for how many planes it expects to make this year and next, citing supply chain issues. It\u2019s the latest bad news for airlines and passengers as jet supply continues to get squeezed. The tighter-than-expected supply of jets is forcing airlines to adjust their expansion plans, even as they deal with record demand for air travel. That means that passengers could find fewer available seats and fares that are higher than they would be otherwise. Airbus has not faced the problems of its primary rival Boeing, which has had production cut back by regulators as it struggles to fix safety and quality issues. Boeing\u2019s problems have piled up after 737 Max Alaska Air flight in January lost a door plug, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. But airlines that use Airbus planes have not been without problems, as a number of  A320neo jets have been grounded due to problems with their engines. Late Monday Airbus announced it now expects to deliver about 770 jets this year, down from its previous target of about 800. And it said while it still has the goal of building 75 of the A320 family of jets a month, it is pushing the target back to 2027, from its previous goal of 2026. \u201cAirbus is facing persistent specific supply chain issues mainly in engines, aerostructures and cabin equipment,\u201d the company said Monday evening. The news sent shares of Airbus down 12% in trading in Paris Tuesday. Shares of Airbus are now down 6% year-to-date, after being up as much as 24% for the year in March on Boeing\u2019s problems. Airlines are seeing very strong demand for air travel. The TSA reported it screened 2.99 million passengers at US airports on Sunday, a one-day record for the agency, and it expects those screened over the week surrounding the July 4 holiday to be up 5% from a year ago. High demand and limited supply tend to be a prescription for higher prices. Airfares soared 30% in 2022 compared to a year earlier, according to the Consumer Price Index, the government\u2019s key inflation measure, as airlines struggled with staffing shortages that limited their ability to provide the flights needed for the post-pandemic rebound in demand for air travel.  Airfares were down 13% to nearly 19% from those 2022 peaks during the summer travel months last year, as the number of available seats on planes rose by about 15% from a year earlier. And fares have continued to be lower this year, but at a far more modest 6% drop on average in the months so far this year, as airlines cut back expansion plans due to the aforementioned aircraft delivery issues. There will likely be upward pressure on fares if the number of jet deliveries from the two major manufacturers remains constrained and demand for travel stays strong. Passengers could also find fuller planes this summer. US airlines filled 86.9% of available seats on planes with paying passengers during the June through August travel season last year, when adjusted for miles traveled, according to data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. And while that load factor was down, as is normal in the first three months of this year, planes were nearly 1% fuller than during the first three months of 2023.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/business/airbus-production-target-cut/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_media_republican-debate-conspiracy-biden", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0allies in right-wing media have a problem ahead of\u00a0CNN\u2019s\u00a0presidential debate: They\u2019ve set the bar too low for\u00a0President Joe Biden. For years, and particularly over the last few months,\u00a0MAGA Media\u00a0has portrayed Biden as a senile, mentally incapacitated elderly man who cannot remember what he had for breakfast, let alone run the federal government. That might sound like an exaggeration to those who don\u2019t tune in to\u00a0Fox News\u00a0or listen to talk radio, but it has been a real and constant theme in the right-wing media universe. To support the narrative, these outlets and personalities have seized on Biden\u2019s verbal gaffes (while ignoring Trump\u2019s) and presented out-of-context video clips to their large audiences \u2014 a deceptive, but effective strategy that the Biden campaign has struggled to meaningfully rebut. Enter Thursday\u2019s high-stakes political showdown. The debate, which will be one of the most-watched moments of the 2024 presidential campaign cycle, will allow audiences from coast-to-coast the opportunity to watch an unfiltered Biden go head-to-head with Trump for some 90 minutes. While the two will undoubtedly tangle over a host of issues, the stage also will afford Biden a unique opportunity to puncture the narrative he lacks the mental fitness to be commander-in-chief. That\u2019s a worry for right-wing media figures, which risk seeing their bogus narrative about Biden being ripped up in real time. As right-wing personality\u00a0Megyn Kelly\u00a0even put it Monday, Biden will come out great if he manages to simply \u201cnot die\u201d during the face-off with Trump. \u201cThe stakes could not be lower for a Joe Biden performance,\u201d Kelly observed. To account for the looming reality in which Biden has no trouble walking on stage without the help of a handler (some in right-wing media had suggested Biden required\u00a0former President Barack Obama\u2019s\u00a0help to complete such a task), Trump\u2019s media allies are already searching for excuses. And they\u2019re getting noticeably desperate. One such claim boosted by Trump\u2019s media allies is the conspiracy theory \u2014\u00a0which lacks any evidence\u00a0\u2014 that the president will be on performance-enhancing supplements or drugs during the debate. That narrative, which was also floated after Biden\u2019s forceful\u00a0State of the Union\u00a0speech earlier this year, has been promoted by none other than Trump himself. \u201cHe\u2019s sleeping now, because they want to get him good and strong,\u201d Trump\u00a0said at a campaign rally\u00a0over the weekend. \u201cSo a little before debate time, he gets a shot in the ass.\u201d That narrative has been, predictably, amplified by Trump\u2019s media supporters, who all overlooked the fact that Trump repeatedly fell asleep mid-day at his own trial earlier this year in court. Fox News host\u00a0Jesse Watters, for instance, played into it on Monday\u2019s episode of\u00a0\u201cThe Five,\u201d\u00a0claiming Biden \u201cis going to be taking shots at the jungle juice\u201d ahead of the debate so that he can appear energetic. MAGA Media has also settled around a scapegoat to protect Trump if he should perform poorly: CNN. The dishonest pro-Trump forces, particularly the overt propagandist\u00a0Sean Hannity, have leveled a barrage of attacks aimed at\u00a0Jake Tapper, who will be co-moderating the debate alongside\u00a0Dana Bash. Tapper, the hard-hitting anchor and CNN\u2019s chief Washington correspondent, has been portrayed as a Democratic hack. While it is an absurd accusation, it is one MAGA Media is gleefully pushing, even attempting to do so on CNN\u2019s own air. On Monday morning, CNN anchor\u00a0Kasie Hunt\u00a0abruptly ended an interview\u00a0with Trump spokesperson\u00a0Karoline Leavitt, who repeatedly assailed Tapper and Bash as \u201cbiased\u201d news anchors. After booting Leavitt from her program, Hunt noted that \u201cif you\u2019re attacking the moderators, you\u2019re usually losing.\u201d Hunt is, of course, spot on. The hang-up, however, for MAGA Media is that they\u2019ve forced themselves into a corner. Now, they\u2019re trying to find a way to break free \u2014 and they\u2019re getting desperate.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/media/republican-debate-conspiracy-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_business_federal-judge-denies-30-billion-settlement-visa-mastercard", "text": "A federal judge overseeing a $30 billion preliminary swipe-fees settlement between Mastercard, Visa and retailers formally rejected the deal Tuesday. The ruling likely means the credit card processors will have to make more concessions to resolve their long-standing dispute with merchants. Mastercard and Visa, two of the world\u2019s largest credit card networks, reached their proposed multi-billion antitrust settlement with US merchants in March. The settlement would lower swipe fees, or interchange fees, that a retailer must pay when a customer makes a purchase using their card. The details of Tuesday\u2019s ruling made by Judge Margo Brodie of the US District Court of the Eastern District of New York have not been made public. But a memo released by the court on Tuesday said that she was \u201cnot likely to grant final approval\u201d to the preliminary settlement absent any changes. Retailers typically are charged 2% of the total customer transaction in swipe fees \u2014\u202fbut they can be as much as 4% for some premium rewards cards, according to industry estimates. The proposed settlement would have lowered those fees by at least 0.04% percentage points for a minimum of three years. What the preliminary settlement entailed The proposed settlement, which hinged on final approval from the Eastern District of New York, resulted from a longstanding antitrust class-action lawsuit in 2005. In the suit, merchants alleged that the card companies and the banks that issue cards with them colluded to charge businesses inflated swipe fees and prevented them from directing their customers to other, cheaper payment options. Under the preliminary settlement, the card companies denied any wrongdoing and agreed to maintain the swipe fee rates that existed as of December 31, 2023, for a period of five years. Visa and Mastercard also agreed to remove anti-competitive restrictions so that merchants could suggest other preferred card options to customers going forward. For one thing, the proposed settlement gave merchants the ability to impose surcharges on customers depending on what kind of Visa or Mastercard card they use. Those surcharges would likely hit cardholders who get rewards such as cash back and airline miles, since those can carry higher swipe fees. Big retailers at odds with small businesses Over 90% of the merchants who agreed to the preliminary settlement with Visa and Mastercard were small businesses, according to Visa. Still, the National Federation of Independent Business viewed it as \u201ctemporary relief\u201d for small businesses and not a long-term solution, Jeff Brabant, vice president of federal government relations at NFIB, told CNN in a statement. Trade groups representing big retailers have been even more outspoken critics. The Merchants Payments Coalition (MPC) \u2014 whose members include supermarkets, retail chains, restaurants, drug stores, convenience stores, gas stations and online merchants focused on payments system reform \u2014 blasted the preliminary settlement as being insufficient. Christopher Jones, an executive committee member of the Merchants Payments Coalition, said it would have enabled the credit card companies to \u201ckeep price-fixing swipe fees and blocking competition.\u201d \u201cThankfully, the judge made the right call in recognizing what a bad deal this would have been for Main Street merchants and their customers,\u201d Jones said in a statement on Tuesday. The Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade group representing a slew of large retailers including Target, CVS, Dollar General, similarly applauded Tuesday\u2019s ruling. \u201cLeading retailers are grateful that Judge Brodie saw through the fa\u00e7ade of the proposed settlement and understood that it would not provide the meaningful change that is needed to correct the competitive imbalance in the interchange ecosystem,\u201d RILA said in a statement. A Mastercard spokesperson told CNN in an emailed statement they were \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the ruling. \u201cWe believe the settlement presented a fair resolution of this long-standing dispute, most notably by giving business owners more flexibility in how they manage their card acceptance activities. We will pursue our options to ensure a proper resolution of this matter.\u201d Visa did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for a comment. Glenn Licht, owner of Pescatore Seafood Company in New York, had been anxiously awaiting the final ruling on the settlement. Licht\u2019s business operates two seafood stores in New York City\u2019s iconic Grand Central Terminal market. One sells prepared seafood for takeaway, and the other is a grab-and-go sushi store. Pre-Covid, Licht said the businesses were 80% cash and 20% credit card payments. \u201cThat\u2019s totally flipped. Now it\u2019s a minimum of 80% credit cards and the rest is cash,\u201d he said. That means with his significant exposure to swipe fees, those extra charges can add up and can affect profitability. \u201cAs a small retailer, you feel the effects of that,\u201d he said. And separate to his two seafood shops, the company also has an online seafood business. \u201cWe also ship seafood nationwide. However, that business is 100% credit cards,\u201d Licht said. Licht said he never believed that the $30 billion settlement would \u201ctrickle down\u201d to him as a small merchant in a way that \u201cwould have been a gamechanger.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think the ruling will move the needle much on our financial statement,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_06_25_investing_premarket-stocks-trading", "text": "The world needs more babies. Falling fertility rates have long been a concern for economists worried that aging societies could diminish the labor force, further exacerbate inflation, upend the consumer culture upon which mature economies depend and overwhelm government programs meant to care for aging populations. Those changes are now upon us. A new study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says that declining birth rates will permanently alter the demographic makeup of the world\u2019s largest economies over the next decade. What\u2019s happening: If forecasts hold up, 2064 will be the first year in modern history where the global death rate surpasses the birth rate. But the world\u2019s largest economies are already there: The total fertility rate among the OECD\u2019s 38 member countries dropped to just 1.5 children per woman in 2022 from 3.3 children in 1960. That\u2019s well below the \u201creplacement level\u201d of 2.1 children per woman needed to keep populations constant. That means the supply of workers in many countries is quickly diminishing. In the 1960s, there were six people of working age for every retired person, according to the World Economic Forum. Today, the ratio is closer to three-to-one. By 2035, it\u2019s expected to be two-to-one. Top executives at publicly traded US companies mentioned labor shortages nearly 7,000 times in earnings calls over the last decade, according to an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis last week. \u201cA reduction in the share of workers can lead to labor shortages, which may raise the bargaining power of employees and lift wages \u2014 all of which is ultimately inflationary,\u201d Simona Paravani-Mellinghoff, managing director at BlackRock, wrote in an analysis last year. And while net immigration has helped offset demographic problems facing rich countries in the past, the shrinking population is now a global phenomenon. \u201cThis is critical because it implies advanced economies may start to struggle to \u2018import\u2019 labour from such places either via migration or sourcing goods,\u201d wrote Paravani-Mellinghoff. By 2100, only six countries are expected to be having enough children to keep their populations stable: Africa\u2019s Chad, Niger and Somalia, the Pacific islands of Samoa and Tonga, and Tajikistan, according to research published by the Lancet, a medical journal. BlackRock\u2019s expert advises her clients to invest in inflation-linked bonds, as well as inflation-hedging commodities like energy, industrial metals and agriculture and livestock. What it means: CEOs and politicians are already preparing for the baby bust. Elon Musk, father of 12 children, has remarked that falling birthrates will lead to \u201ca civilization that ends not with a bang but a whimper, in adult diapers.\u201d While his words are incendiary, they\u2019re not entirely wrong. P&G and Kimberly-Clark, which together make up more than half of the US diaper market, have seen baby diaper sales decline over the past few years. But adult diapers sales, they say, are a bright spot in their portfolios. Other companies are also pivoting toward an older demo. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s chief executive, Mark Schneider, recently said he\u2019s shifted the company\u2019s priorities from producing infant formula to serving the nutritional needs of people over the age of 50. Overstretched governments: French President Emmanuel Macron in January announced a plan for \u201cdemographic rearmament\u201d in his country through fertility testing and more parental leave. Former President Donald Trump also recently promised that, if elected, he would support \u201cbaby bonuses for a new baby boom\u201d in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported that the US birth rate in 2023 fell to a record low, reversing a small uptick seen during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is also predicting that deaths will outnumber births just over 15 years from now. Those findings underpin the agency\u2019s economic forecast and budget projections, said Molly Dahl, a senior advisor at the CBO. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is increased spending on programs like Medicare and Social Security as the baby boomers are aging into those programs. And then of course, fewer workers relative to the number of people who are receiving Social Security and Medicare benefits,\u201d said Dahl. Social Security payments still provide about 90% of income for more than a quarter of older adults in the United States, according to Social Security Agency surveys. But without intervention, the Social Security trust fund will be depleted by the mid-2030s, meaning that only a portion of retirees\u2019 expected benefits will be paid out. The AI solution: Some business leaders and technologists see the boom in productivity through artificial intelligence as a potential solution. \u201cHere are the facts. We are not having enough children, and we have not been having enough children for long enough that there is a demographic crisis, former Google CEO and executive chairman Eric Schmidt said at the Wall Street Journal\u2019s CEO Council Summit in London last year. \u201cIn aggregate, all the demographics say there\u2019s going to be a shortage of humans for jobs. Literally too many jobs and not enough people for at least the next 30 years,\u201d Schmidt said. But, he said, artificial intelligence will ease those problems significantly. A recent report by Goldman Sachs predicted that generative AI could raise global GDP by as much as 7% over a 10-year period. Still, some experts say it\u2019s too soon to tell how AI will impact the global economy. A recent study by analysts at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond concluded that artificial intelligence could increase labor productivity between 1.5% and 18% over the next decade. \u201cThis ranges from barely noticeable to substantial,\u201d they said. The long-term solution to declining fertility rates, said Stefano Scarpetta, director for employment, labour and social affairs at the OECD, is to promote more gender equality and fairer sharing of work and childrearing. That also means more paid parental leave and financial support. In the meantime, he said \u201cthis is not just a temporary blip.\u201d Companies and governments need to prepare now for what he calls a \u201clow-fertility future.\u201d China warns against \u2018vicious cycle\u2019 of decoupling from the West Chinese Premier Li Qiang has warned against a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d of economic decoupling from the West, as Beijing struggles to contain rising global pushback over soaring electric vehicle (EV) exports, report my CNN colleagues Juliana Liu\u00a0and Joyce Jiang. Speaking to international executives at the \u201cSummer Davos\u201d forum in the northeastern city of Dalian on Tuesday, Li also defended his country against accusations that\u00a0Chinese overcapacity\u00a0in key green industries has led to dumping of products such as EVs and solar panels on global markets. \u201cIf countries only consider maximizing their own interests, if we ignore the interests of others, and even go back in history and engage in decoupling \u2026 it will only raise the economic operating costs of the entire society and the world,\u201d he said. This will \u201cdrag countries \u2026 into a vicious cycle of scrambling for a cake that becomes smaller and smaller,\u201d Li added. \u201cThis is something that we don\u2019t want to see.\u201d The remarks by China\u2019s second most powerful leader after Xi Jinping come a day after Canada became the latest Western country to consider\u00a0imposing\u00a0tariffs on EVs made in China. The Canadian government said on Monday that its workers faced \u201cunfair competition\u201d from Beijing\u2019s \u201cstate-directed policy of overcapacity.\u201d It will begin a 30-day public consultation period next month to assess possible responses. Last month, the Biden administration\u00a0quadrupled tariffs\u00a0on EV imports from China, from 25% to 100%, aiming to protect American jobs and manufacturing. Chinese EV sales to the United States are tiny. Prosecutors urge Justice Department to file criminal charges against Boeing over 737 Max Prosecutors are urging the US Justice Department to file criminal charges against Boeing for safety issues surrounding its 737 Max, although top Justice Department officials haven\u2019t made a final decision, a source familiar with the development tells CNN. The possible criminal charges are just the latest severe blow to the reputation of Boeing, a company once known for the quality and safety of its commercial jets. Beyond two fatal crashes of the 737 Max in 2018 and 2019, the company has faced a series of questions about the safety and quality of its jets. In January, a door plug on a 737 Max flown by Alaska Air blew out early in a flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet, further damaging Boeing\u2019s reputation. The Justice Department and Boeing had reached an agreement in January of 2021 to settle charges that alleged the company defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the certification process of the 737 Max before it could carry its first passengers. The plane started service in 2017, but suffered two fatal crashes \u2013 in October 2018 and March of 2019 \u2013 which led to a 20-month grounding of the jet. The cause of the crashes proved to be a design flaw, Boeing has admitted. Read more here.

{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_business_ford-recalling-550000-trucks", "text": "Ford is recalling more than 550,000 F-150 pickups in the United States because of an issue that can cause the transmission to suddenly and unexpectedly, at any speed, shift down to first gear. These trucks have six-speed transmissions. Usually, first gear is used to drive a vehicle at very low speeds, so suddenly shifting to first gear at high speed could cause the truck to slow rapidly or even cause the driver to lose control. The trucks involved are older models from the 2014 model year. The problem with these particular trucks first came to Ford\u2019s attention in February of this year, though, as the automaker received a number of reports of 2014 F-150s suddenly downshifting at the wrong time. Before that happens, a malfunction indicator light in the truck\u2019s gauge cluster may turn on Ford spokesperson Maria Buczkowski said in an email to CNN. In some cases, the problem may quickly rectify itself and the truck will continue driving normally. In other cases, the truck may need to be shut down and restarted before the transmission begins working normally again. In 2019, Ford recalled roughly 1.2 million model year 2011 through 2013 F-150s for the same issue. The problem results from a loss of signal between a speed sensor and a control module that operates the automatic transmission. To fix the problem, Ford dealers will update the trucks\u2019 control module software at no cost to the owner. Ford will start mailing letters to owners of the trucks involved in a few days. A new software update to fix the 2014 trucks will be ready sometime in the next three months, Buczkowski said. Customers with questions can call Ford customer service at 866-436-7332 and ask for information about recall number 24S37.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/business/ford-recalling-550000-trucks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_tech_tiktok-court-filing-biden-administration", "text": "TikTok ramped up its attacks on the Biden administration Thursday over a law that could ban the popular app from the United States, arguing in a court filing that US TikTok users could be forced to live on an \u201cisland\u201d of content disconnected from the rest of the world if the platform is forced to find a new owner. The legal filing also publicizes, for the first time, the text of a draft agreement between TikTok and the US government that the company claims would have addressed national security concerns linked to the app but that was allegedly discarded in favor of legislation that TikTok argues violates the First Amendment. Thursday\u2019s filing marks TikTok\u2019s opening salvo in a pivotal case that could not only determine the fate of an app used by 170 million Americans but also how courts interpret the First Amendment and its relationship to all online speech. The Justice Department declined to comment. TikTok has insisted it is not possible for its Chinese parent ByteDance to divest from the app \u2013 \u201cnot possible technologically, commercially, or legally\u201d \u2013 and not by the January 2025 deadline laid out by the law that President Joe Biden signed in April. \u201cEven if divestiture were feasible, TikTok in the United States would still be reduced to a shell of its former self, stripped of the innovative and expressive technology that tailors content to each user,\u201d the company wrote in its brief. \u201cIt also would become an island, preventing Americans from exchanging views with the global TikTok community.\u201d That is because the law TikTok is challenging prohibits the type of data-sharing agreements that would be necessary to display international TikTok content to US TikTok users, the company claimed in its filing. That dire warning echoed claims in a related legal brief filed by TikTok content creators Thursday. The group of creators, which includes a football coach, a sexual assault survivor advocate and a US Air Force veteran, argued that the challenged law would prevent them from choosing where and how to express themselves, as well as their First Amendment right to receive others\u2019 speech. Meanwhile, TikTok\u2019s focus on the draft agreement with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a multi-agency panel charged with reviewing the national security implications of foreign investment deals, could prove central to the company\u2019s case. The proposed deal\u2019s existence, TikTok said, is evidence of a lighter-touch option that could have achieved the government\u2019s goals without a potential divestiture or app ban. Whether the Biden administration overlooked a less restrictive alternative could become a factor in a potential test of the law\u2019s constitutionality. In Thursday\u2019s filing, TikTok said the agreement was never signed despite years of negotiations and dozens of meetings and phone calls with US government officials. And after months of radio silence beginning in September 2022, CFIUS allegedly told TikTok in March 2023 that \u201c\u2018senior government officials\u2019 demanded divestment without explaining why the Agreement was insufficient.\u201d TikTok added that it then requested meetings with senior US officials but \u201creceived no meaningful responses.\u201d For years, US officials have warned of the possibility that the Chinese government could gain access to TikTok\u2019s user data through its influence over ByteDance. The Trump administration tried to ban TikTok by executive action, but that was quickly stymied by legal challenges. As Biden signed April\u2019s legislation, Trump reversed himself, saying a ban would only help TikTok\u2019s rival, Meta. Independent cybersecurity experts say the potential exists based on how China\u2019s laws are written, but that it so far remains a hypothetical and that there are many other sources of sensitive data China can freely obtain, for example by buying it on the open market. US officials have not publicly presented evidence that China has accessed US users\u2019 TikTok data. But they warn that information could be used to target propaganda or to identify intelligence targets, and they have given members of Congress classified briefings about the app\u2019s potential risks. TikTok, for its part, has denied ever giving the Chinese government access to its data and has blasted the confidential congressional briefings as part of a flawed, rushed and secretive legislative process. Attached to the company\u2019s brief on Thursday was an appendix containing the entire 103-page draft agreement. Outlining what has come to be known as Project Texas, TikTok\u2019s plan for segregating US user data from its global operation, the draft document also shows a provision that would entitle the US government to temporarily stop or even shut down TikTok\u2019s app if TikTok fails to comply with any of a dozen requirements, such as allowing qualified inspectors to review the company\u2019s source code. On Thursday, TikTok\u2019s filing said the company has so far spent $2 billion voluntarily implementing Project Texas. Also included with TikTok\u2019s detailed filing was a signed declaration from a third-party expert and former CFIUS official, Christopher Simkins, who said the proposal as written was as robust as any they had seen in two decades of experience. If implemented, Simkins said,\u00a0TikTok\u2019s national security risks \u201cwould be reduced to a LOW level.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/tech/tiktok-court-filing-biden-administration/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_economy_mortgage-rates-june-20", "text": "Mortgage rates fell this week to their lowest level since early April, taking some pressure off America\u2019s unaffordable housing market. The standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.87% in the week ending June 20, mortgage financing giant Freddie Mac reported Thursday. That\u2019s down from last week\u2019s 6.95% average and marks the third consecutive weekly decline. Rates are down from a 2024 peak of 7.22%. \u201cMortgage rates fell for the third straight week following signs of cooling inflation and market expectations of a future Federal Reserve rate cut,\u201d said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac\u2019s chief economist, in a release. \u201cThese lower mortgage rates coupled with the gradually improving housing supply bodes well for the housing market.\u201d Still, mortgage rates remain higher than anything seen in the decade before 2022, the year the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates to combat inflation. Borrowing costs are poised to ease this year, but it may not be by much. Earlier this month, Fed officials penciled in just one interest rate cut for this year, compared to the three they forecast in March. The Fed doesn\u2019t directly set mortgage rates but its actions do influence them through the benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield, which moves in anticipation of the Fed\u2019s policy moves. Economists don\u2019t expect the average mortgage rate to fall below 6% this year. Homebuilding constrained by high interest rates While mortgage rates have eased recently, the US housing market overall remains hamstrung by elevated interest rates, which seem to be taking a toll on homebuilding. New home construction was much weaker than expected in May, according to separate government statistics released Thursday, with a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.28 million units in May, the lowest level since 2020 and down by 5.5% from April. That was well below the 1% gain economists projected in a FactSet poll. Building permits, seen as a forward indicator of future construction, also came in below economists\u2019 expectations. Additionally, sentiment among America\u2019s homebuilders fell in May to its lowest level since December, according to the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index released Wednesday. \u201cPersistently high mortgage rates are keeping many prospective buyers on the sidelines,\u201d NAHB Chairman Carl Harris said in a release. \u201cHome builders are also dealing with higher rates for construction and development loans, chronic labor shortages and a dearth of buildable lots.\u201d A lack of homes on the market has been a longstanding issue for housing in America. Sluggish homebuilding doesn\u2019t help that, but housing inventory has improved in recent months as some Americans part with their homes. Expensive homes, big down payment Home prices remain sky-high, which is another key factor exacerbating America\u2019s affordability crisis. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index rose 6.5% in March from a year earlier to a record high, showing strong demand in urban population centers such as San Diego, Los Angeles and New York. It was the sixth time the index has reached a new record high over the past year. The index for April is due next week. The annual Demographic International Housing Affordability report, which has been tracking home prices for 20 years, showed that America\u2019s most expensive housing markets are in California. Honolulu, Hawaii\u2019s capital, was also listed as one of the most expensive in the world. Buyers are also having to come up with a huge down payment that\u2019s roughly double the median salary of a US worker. A median-income household would need to save up more than $127,000 for a down payment to afford a monthly mortgage payment on the typical US home, according to a recent Zillow analysis. \u201cSaving enough is a tall task without outside help \u2014 a gift from family or perhaps a stock windfall. To make the finances work, some folks are making a big move across the country, co-buying or buying a home with an extra room to rent out,\u201d Skylar Olsen, chief economist at Zillow, said in a release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/economy/mortgage-rates-june-20/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

By June, they had lowered that projection to just one cut. Now some key policymakers say it won\u2019t happen at all. On Tuesday morning, Fed governor Michelle Bowman said that she\u2019s expecting no rate cuts this year. \u201cInflation in the US remains elevated and I still see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook,\u201d Bowman said at an event hosted by the Policy Exchange think tank in London. Supply chains have largely normalized, she said. The labor-force participation rate has leveled off after a post-Covid boom, and the US immigration policy rate may soon become more restrictive, limiting potential new labor market participants. None of these factors leave her confident that inflation rates will ease in the coming months. Bowman, who is a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, also hinted that interest rates could go higher if inflation accelerates. \u201cI remain willing to raise the target range for the federal-funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse,\u201d she said. \u201cReducing our policy rate too soon or too quickly could result in a rebound in inflation, requiring further future policy rate increases to return inflation to 2% over the longer run.\u201d Investors weren\u2019t happy to hear it. The Dow fell nearly 400 points Tuesday. (The broader S&P 500 was slightly higher, boosted by a comeback in Nvidia.) Bowman joins a growing contingent of Fed officials who have hinted that rates will likely remain the same for the remainder of the year. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly. Also a voting member this year, said on Monday the Fed must be agile and \u201cif inflation falls more slowly than expected, the policy rate must stay higher for longer.\u201d Speaking at the Commonwealth Club World Affairs of California in San Francisco, Daly said the economy remained strong and that she would not consider preemptively lowering interest rates before inflation comes down. \u201cI do think that preemptive cutting is something that you do when you see risks,\u201d Daly said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be resolute until we finish the job. That\u2019s why not taking preemptive action when it\u2019s not necessary is so important.\u201d Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee has also been particularly hawkish in his views. Goolsbee said on Monday that he would need to see \u201cmore months\u2019 of strong inflation data to even begin to consider cutting rates. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who is not voting this year, has floated the possibility of not cutting rates at all this year multiple times over the past few months.

{"id": "2024_06_25_business_trump-media-technology-group-value", "text": "Reid Hoffman knows firsthand that riches can be made building a social media empire. But the LinkedIn co-founder is dumbfounded by the size of the social media fortune former President Donald Trump is sitting on. Trump\u2019s conservative social media company, Truth Social owner Trump Media & Technology Group, is valued by Wall Street at a whopping $6 billion \u2014 even after a recent plunge in its share price. \u201cThat is wildly high,\u201d Hoffman, a Biden donor who is now a director at Microsoft and a venture capital investor, told CNN. \u201cThe Truth Social numbers are so absurdly out of the realm of normal business.\u201d Shares of Trump Media (DJT) spiked more than 20% on Monday, its second-best day since it started trading on the Nasdaq in late March. Trump Media shares jumped another 9% on Tuesday. Unlike social media site LinkedIn, which reached a deal to be sold to Microsoft in 2016 for $26 billion, Trump Media generates little revenue and remains a tiny player in the industry. Truth Social\u2019s user count is dwarfed by Reddit, Elon Musk\u2019s X (formerly Twitter) and even Instagram\u2019s Threads. In 2023, Trump Media brought in just $4.1 million in revenue. That means Wall Street is assigning an astronomical price-to-sales ratio of more than 1,400 based on trailing revenue. By comparison, Wall Street values social media leader Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, at just nine times trailing revenue. Hoffman, who has been a vocal critic of Trump, noted that if Meta sported a price-to-sales ratio like Trump Media\u2019s, it would be valued at more than $150 trillion (instead of its current market value of $1.3 trillion). \u201cTrump Media is probably more appropriately valued close to $40 million rather than several billion,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cTruth Social is burning through hundreds of millions of dollars with nothing to show for it in user engagement, user growth or even potential revenue.\u201d Trump Media did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Trump Media\u2019s share price started to fall sharply after May 30 when Trump \u2014 the company\u2019s chairman and leading shareholder \u2014 was convicted of 34 felony counts in a hush money trial. The company\u2019s market value crumbled by half between May 30 and last week before bouncing back Monday. In an SEC filing, Trump Media disclosed Monday it expects to raise more than $69 million in proceeds from investors exercising warrants to buy common stock. Trump\u2019s stake is worth nearly $4 billion Hoffman is hardly the first to express disbelief at the valuation of Trump Media. Some experts have described Trump Media as a \u201cmeme stock,\u201d like GameStop and AMC. (Meme stocks typically trade more on hype and social media sentiment than fundamentals.) Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida who has studied capital markets for four decades, told CNN last week that Trump Media\u2019s share price is still \u201cwildly overpriced.\u201d Billionaire media mogul Barry Diller, who sits on the boards of Expedia, Coca-Cola and MGM Resorts International, told CNBC that Trump Media is a \u201cscam\u201d and people buying its shares are \u201cdopes.\u201d And yet the market has consistently been valuing Trump Media in the billions of dollars. That lofty valuation has catapulted the net worth of Trump, the company\u2019s dominant shareholder. Based on Monday\u2019s share price, Trump\u2019s 114.75 million shares in Trump Media are valued at nearly $4 billion. That\u2019s down from $6 billion as recently as May 30 but up from $3 billion late last week. Why Trump Media is worth so much Hoffman has some theories as to why some investors are \u201cholding on to the stock in spite of the underlying business\u2019s very glaring deficiencies.\u201d He told CNN that Trump Media\u2019s share price is likely being propped up by \u201cgullible money from day traders who support Trump personally\u201d and by a \u201cbet that Trump will win the White House, causing the stock to spike.\u201d Indeed, analysts have previously told CNN that Trump Media has become a way to bet on Trump\u2019s political fortunes and the idea that early next year Truth Social could be the main platform for presidential communication. Hoffman speculated that \u201cdeep pockets\u201d such as wealthy individuals or even governments are holding onto their Trump Media shares to \u201cartificially prop up\u201d the value of Trump\u2019s stake.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/business/trump-media-technology-group-value/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

VW\u2019s investments will provide capital to help Rivian scale up its manufacturing as it looks toward building a new factory in the state of Georgia, Scaringe said. \u201cThis is important for us financially,\u201d he said, \u201cand one of the elements here is that it\u2019s also implicit Rivian\u2019s successes is important for Volkswagen Group\u2019s success.\u201d Both companies said they plan to launch new vehicles utilizing the joint venture\u2019s technologies before 2030. Rivian\u2019s fundamental vehicle software design is expected to provide the basis for the new company\u2019s software. The technologies designed by the company will include both the user-interface software that runs things like the entertainment system and gauges and deeper vehicle software that interacts with things like the vehicle\u2019s motors. Rivian will also contribute the electric hardware designs on which these systems will run, according to a joint announcement. VW already has its own vehicle software subsidiary, Cariad, and that company will continue with its work, VW chief executive Oliver Blume said on a conference call. The new joint venture\u2019s work will be in addition to Cariad\u2019s and not in place of it, he said The companies could also cooperate on vehicles, themselves one day, Scaringe said during the call, but that\u2019s not part of what\u2019s envisioned currently. For now, the companies will just work together on vehicle software and computer systems. The idea for the joint venture first arose when Scaringe and Blume were talking at Porsche\u2019s Experience Center in Atlanta where Porsche owners and enthusiasts can drive Porsche cars and SUVs on a test track. \u201cSo, we had a lot of fun just talking about how aligned we both saw (cars),\u201d Scaringe said. \u201cBut, quickly, that led to a serious conversation as to how can we look at working together.\u201d In addition to being CEO of Volkswagen Group as a whole, Blume is also CEO of Porsche. Scaringe said he, himself, is a longtime Porsche enthusiast and, when he was S to restore classic Porsche sports cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/business/rivian-vw-vehicle-software/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_tech_microsoft-teams-eu-antitrust", "text": "Microsoft has violated European Union antitrust laws by bundling Teams with its other popular applications for businesses, EU officials said Tuesday, marking the bloc\u2019s latest challenge to a US tech giant. If confirmed, the preliminary findings of an EU investigation could lead to a fine of up to 10% of Microsoft\u2019s global revenue, which totaled $211 billion in its latest financial year. The announcement comes a day after EU regulators accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the bloc\u2019s landmark Digital Markets Act, a groundbreaking law that forced big changes on dominant tech platforms after it came into force in March. Apple, which has denied wrongdoing, also faces a huge fine if the charges are confirmed. The actions by the EU could result in changes to the way hundreds of millions of Europeans access services on some of the world\u2019s biggest digital platforms, reflecting a big push by European lawmakers to rein in the power of Big Tech. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, opened an investigation into Microsoft\u2019s software practices almost a year ago following a complaint in 2020 by the cloud-based internal messaging app Slack, which is now owned by Salesforce (CRM). Slack alleged that Microsoft (MSFT) had given Teams, which offers messaging, calling and video meetings, an unfair advantage by automatically including it with its Office software and thereby denying Slack an opportunity to compete on a level playing field. The European Commission shares Slack\u2019s worries. \u201cWe are concerned that Microsoft may be giving its own communication product Teams an undue advantage over competitors, by tying it to its popular productivity suites for businesses,\u201d the EU\u2019s competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in statement. \u201cPreserving competition for remote communication and collaboration tools is essential as it also fosters innovation on these markets. If confirmed, Microsoft\u2019s conduct would be illegal under our competition rules,\u201d she added. According to the Commission, Microsoft has been forcing customers to acquire Teams by automatically including the tool in its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites. The company\u2019s advantage over rivals \u201cmay have been further exacerbated by interoperability limitations between Teams\u2019 competitors and Microsoft\u2019s offerings. The conduct may have prevented Teams\u2019 rivals from competing, and in turn innovating, to the detriment of customers,\u201d the Commission said. Microsoft announced last year that it would stop the Teams bundling practice in Europe and extended the same commitment globally in April. But, while the Commission acknowledged that the company had started offering \u201csome suites without Teams,\u201d it said it believes \u201cmore changes to Microsoft\u2019s conduct are necessary to restore competition.\u201d In a statement, Microsoft President Brad Smith said: \u201cHaving unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission\u2019s remaining concerns.\u201d Salesforce, meanwhile, welcomed the Commission\u2019s findings, calling its actions \u201ca win for customer choice and an affirmation that Microsoft practices with Teams have harmed competition.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_food_perkins-new-name-remodel", "text": "At 66 years old, Perkins Restaurant and Bakery is due for a touch up. The diner chain, best known for its pies and pancakes, is getting a major makeover that includes a new logo and name, a redesign of its nearly 300 restaurants as well as a revamped menu, which still emphasizes value, with refreshed ingredients in hopes of attracting new customers that have forgotten about the chain. Perkins\u2019 changes come as similarly aged rivals, like Cracker Barrel, are facing struggles to remain relevant, especially with older diners that have changed their habits following Covid-19 as well as surging menu prices that are forcing people to eat more affordably at home because grocery prices are rising at a slower pace. The whole \u201cnew vibe,\u201d as Perkins President Toni Ronayne describes it, comes from its research that \u201cguests want the American classics of yesterday in a place that feels like today.\u201d First, the name is changing to \u201cPerkins American Food Co.\u201d making it more encompassing of what it offers. That means \u201cbakery,\u201d which has been part of its moniker for the past five decades, is disappearing but the bakery will still exist in its restaurants. The refreshed name \u201creally speaks to our American values and the American comfort food we deliver,\u201d Ronayne told CNN. \u201cWe felt this was a more modern, fresh and relevant vibe to start connecting with new consumers, while also servicing our guests that are tried-and-true Perkins loyalists.\u201d Along with the new name, the company will freshen up the green used in its logo with a new lighter version that \u201cleans into a more of heritage palette that still feels modern.\u201d The refreshed logo will also keep a retro feel. Restaurants will be remodeled in the coming years to reflect the changes, with the bakery still front and center near the entrance. The drab coloring that was part of its 2013 renovations is going away. Meanwhile, new digital menu boards will hang above the bakery. Modern subway tiles will line its walls along with brighter flooring, new tables, silverware and uniforms. Perkins didn\u2019t reveal costs of the renovations for franchisees, but Ronayne said it hopes to grow the chain\u2019s footprint with new versions that are more affordable to build. (A new location showcasing all the changes opens in Orlando, Florida, later this year.) The menu is also getting tweaked, with eaters seeing that roll out over the next several months. Perkins hope new hamburgers and updated ingredients in other foods, , such as new seasoning on its french fries, will help convince customers that it isn\u2019t just for breakfast and pies. For example, a construction of a new Perkins is now 3,500 square feet (a reduction of 6,000 square feet) with smaller kitchens and dining rooms. It\u2019s also piloting an even smaller prototype, dubbed \u201cPerkins Express,\u201d for spaces where a traditional restaurant can\u2019t fit like airports or mall food courts. Perkins has positioned itself for eaters on a budget, with a variety of platters that includes a main and a few side dishes. Although that won\u2019t drastically change with the new menus, Ronayne said the chain \u201cwill continue to evolve and explore pricing in our restaurants and in our menu items ensuring that we\u2019re able to provide value and remain competitive.\u201d \u201cWe know that value is so critical right now and we\u2019re very mindful of that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to be the leader of family dining and be able to reach guests that are looking for both value and premium options.\u201d Other breakfast-focused competitors have been feeling the economic pressure. IHOP, owned by Dine Brands (DIN), reported in its most recent earnings that same-store sales fell nearly 2% because of higher menu prices. Denny\u2019s (DENN) also reported a tough quarter because of similar problems and its stock is down nearly 35% for the year. Perkins\u2019 sales have slid about 5% every year since 2019, according to Technomic data, and several locations have closed since then. The segment is a \u201ctough one\u201d because of a number of competitors, said David Henkes, senior principal for the consulting firm. \u201cThe brand largely appeals to Baby Boomers, and I think the opportunities for Perkins lies in creating a broader brand appeal and trying to reach other dayparts and occasions,\u201d he told CNN. Perkins\u2019 problems Perkins has been privately owned by Ascent Hospitality Management since 2019, which also controls Huddle House. The firm is investing in the classic American brand that\u2019s been marred with financial issues, including two bankruptcies, following a disastrous 2006 merger with Marie Callender\u2019s. Its location count has dwindled by nearly half in recent years, customer traffic has slipped and competition from both fast food and new, fresher-looking upstarts are on the rise, according to R.J.\u00a0Hottovy, head of analytical research for\u00a0Placer.ai. \u201cPerkins has faced a number of challenges the past several years, including new sources of competition from emerging breakfast-first chains like First Watch and\u00a0consumers\u00a0shifting to more affordable options in the quick service restaurant and value grocery categories,\u201d he told CNN. Remodels of aging companies \u201csuccessfully drive increased visits by repositioning their brand, remodeling stores, and making enhancements to their menu, but usually in conjunction with an increased\u00a0emphasis on affordability or other promotional\u00a0activity,\u201d he added. Perkins is optimistic the changes, which will be highlighted in a new marketing campaign, will work. After all, Ronayne said that it\u2019s endured prior name changes: The first location opened in Cincinnati, Ohio, as Perkins Pancake House in 1958. About a decade later the company tweaked its name to Perkins Cake and Steak for a brief time before changing to its current branding. \u201cWe really feel that this iteration of \u2018Perkins American Food Co.\u2019 is going to marry tradition and innovation and keep us true to who we are,\u201d she said. \u201cWe recognize there\u2019s an opportunity for us to reach different consumers.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/food/perkins-new-name-remodel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

The retail toy brand premiered a short promo film at the 2024 Cannes Lions Festival in France this week that was created almost entirely by using OpenAI\u2019s new text-to-video tool. The company\u2019s entertainment studio partnered with creative agency Native Foreign, which had early access to Sora. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us said it believes it is the first brand to debut a film using the technology. The tool is not yet publicly available. The 66-second promo follows a young Toys \u201cR\u201d Us founder, Charles Lazarus, who had a vision to transform toy stores with the help of the brand\u2019s mascot Geoffrey the Giraffe, who came to him in a dream. Reactions to the clip were mixed on social media, with some calling it a compelling, fascinating look into the future of film; others called it \u201ccreepy.\u201d Toys \u201cR\u201d Us said that in addition to Sora, it used some corrective visual effects and an original music score. In February, OpenAI \u2013 the company behind the viral ChatGPT chatbot \u2013 introduced the AI model Sora which it claimed can create realistic and imaginative videos from quick text prompts. It said the tool is capable of generating videos up to 60 seconds and can serve up scenes with multiple characters, specific types of motion and detailed background details. Following the announcement, experts said text-to-video types of AI models could have the potential to disrupt the digital entertainment market. Kim Miller, CMO of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us Creative studios, told CNN the concept was born after she attended a brand storytelling group and told the host she wanted to do something \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cdifferent\u201d for their next project, which involved the origin story of the founder. After Native Foreign became an early tester of Sora, chief creative officer Nik Kleverov, chief creative officer called Miller with the proposal to join forces. \u201cEverything you see was created with text but some shots came together quicker than others; some took more iterations,\u201d he said. \u201cThe blocking, the way the character looks, what they\u2019re wearing, the emotion, the background \u2013 it has to be a perfect dance. Sometimes you would create something that was almost right and other times not so right.\u201d Miller said there was also a lot of gut checking and human involvement throughout the process. \u201cSometimes it would check a box, but maybe a reaction wouldn\u2019t\u00a0be on time with what was going on,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a lot of learning and a lot of back and forth. It was an educational process.\u201d Miller, who was an early adopter of Facebook Live when she worked with Martha Stewart, believes the best way to understand technology is to actually experience it, rather than just going off what you\u2019re hearing from other people. \u201cThe same is true for AI,\u201d she said. She added Toys \u201cR\u201d Us is currently exploring advertising opportunities for the promo. \u201cOur big mission is to make sure everyone knows there is a Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us in every Macy\u2019s, so there may be a holiday iteration of it coming soon,\u201d Miller said.

{"id": "2024_06_25_tech_snapchat-teen-sextortion-prevention-safety", "text": "Snapchat is working to make it harder for teenagers to be contacted on the app by people they don\u2019t know, its latest effort to stop the sexual and financial exploitation scam known as sextortion. The company on Tuesday announced a set of new safety features, including expanded warning pop-ups that appear when a teen receives a message from someone they don\u2019t share mutual friends with or have in their contacts. Now, teens will also receive a warning message if they receive a chat from a user who has been blocked or reported by others or who is from a region where the teen\u2019s other contacts aren\u2019t located, \u201csigns that the person may be a scammer,\u201d Snapchat said in a blog post Tuesday. And Snapchat will now prevent the delivery of friend requests for teens to or from an account that they don\u2019t share mutual friends with that is also located in regions often associated with scammers. In addition to expanding Snapchat\u2019s broader suite of youth safety measures, the new features are aimed specifically at preventing financial sextortion, a worrying and growing type of scam across social media where bad actors gain the trust of young users, convince them to send sexual or explicit photos and then demand payment in exchange for keeping the pictures a secret. \u201cThese features were designed to better protect teens from potential online harms and to enhance the real-friend connections that make Snapchat so unique,\u201d Snap\u2019s Global Head of Platform Safety Jacqueline Beauchere said in an exclusive statement to CNN ahead of the announcement. Law enforcement officials have in recent years warned of an uptick in online sextortion scams, in which bad actors, typically located overseas, target children and teens, often with profiles that appear to belong to friendly fellow teenagers. In some cases, sextortion has resulted in suicides. Meta in April also announced new features aimed at combating sextortion, including informing users when they\u2019ve interacted with someone who engaged in financial sextortion. And the chief executives of Meta and Snap, along with other social media leaders, were called to testify earlier this year in a Senate subcommittee hearing about their efforts to protect young people from online exploitation. Also among Snapchat\u2019s announcements on Tuesday are improvements to the app\u2019s blocking tools, which will prevent users from simply creating new accounts to get around a block. Now, when a user blocks another account, any new accounts created on the same device will also automatically be blocked. Snapchat is also introducing more frequent reminders to all users, including teens, about their location settings on the app\u2019s \u201cSnap Map\u201d feature, which is toggled off by default but which users can update to share their location live with friends. The company said it will make it possible for users to update their location settings, remove their location from the map and customize which friends they share their location with \u2013 all in one spot on the app. The updates build on Snapchat\u2019s existing teen safety features, which include a \u201cFamily Center\u201d where parents can supervise the behavior of 13- to 17-year-old users, and mechanisms for removing age-inappropriate content. Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 (or 800-273-8255) to connect with a trained counselor or visit the\u00a0NSPL site.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/tech/snapchat-teen-sextortion-prevention-safety/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_economy_us-consumer-confidence-june", "text": "US consumer confidence teetered slightly in June as Americans grew a little warier about the future, new data released Tuesday showed. The Conference Board\u2019s latest consumer confidence index dipped to 100.4 in June from a downwardly revised level of 101.3 in May. June\u2019s reading landed in line with what economists were expecting but reinforced what\u2019s become a running theme: Despite continued economic growth and a historically strong labor market, Americans say their confidence has grown increasingly threadbare after a prolonged stint of high inflation and interest rates. \u201cThe details continue to demonstrate a hesitant, but not overly concerned, consumer,\u201d Wells Fargo economists Shannon Seery Grein and Jeremiah Kohl wrote in an investor note on Tuesday. Separate survey data released Tuesday by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\u2019s Consumer Finance Institute showed that while respondents maintained a net positive outlook on the economy, more than one-third of them reported concern about making ends meet in the next seven to 12 months. Measurements of Americans\u2019 confidence are typically closely watched, as consumer spending accounts for nearly 70% of US economic activity. But that significance is even more heightened now with the US presidential election just months away. Future outlook remains downbeat The Conference Board\u2019s latest report showed that Americans felt better about the labor market, which outweighed concerns about the future; however, consumers\u2019 feelings on current business conditions cooled, noted Dana Peterson, chief economist of the business membership and research organization. \u201cHowever, if material weaknesses in the labor market appear, confidence could weaken as the year progresses,\u201d she said in a statement. Consumers felt different levels of confidence around different parts of the economy. The present situations index ticked up to 141.5 (its highest level since March) from 140.8; however, the expectations index dropped to 73, marking the fifth consecutive month below 80, which the Conference Board considers as a threshold signaling a recession is ahead. The expectations index has been at or above that potential recession threshold only six months since March 2022, when escalating inflation forced the Federal Reserve to start a historic rate-tightening campaign. Inflation has cooled considerably during the past two years but is still above the central bank\u2019s 2% target. Interest rates remain at a 23-year high and have helped to tamp down demand. Although the strong jobs market has helped prop up consumer spending and kept the economy churning, the dual pressures of elevated inflation and high interest rates have weighed down some people. Credit card balances are growing and delinquencies are on the rise. The Philly Fed\u2019s latest Labor, Income, Finances, and Expectations (LIFE) Survey showed there was a sharp year-over-year increase in anxiety about making ends meet: In April 2024, 26.2% of respondents who said they could pay all their bills reported concern about being able to do so in the next six months. That\u2019s up from 20.7% in April 2023. A critical read on inflation is coming Tuesday\u2019s consumer confidence index is a reflection of a further cooling in spending growth ahead, according to Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics\u2019 chief economist. \u201cIn one line\ufeff, (the index is) consistent with slowing consumption growth and a gently rising unemployment rate,\u201d he wrote. The Conference Board\u2019s confidence index and the\u00a0University of Michigan\u2019s twice-a-month consumer sentiment index\u00a0are two of the leading gauges of consumers\u2019 attitudes toward the current and future strength of the economy. Although the two indexes typically track similarly over time, the consumer confidence index is more influenced by employment and labor market conditions, while the Michigan sentiment index has a greater emphasis on household finances and the impact of inflation. The Michigan index\u2019s preliminary reading for June, released earlier this month, showed sentiment levels were at a seven-month low. The latest, and highly critical, read on inflation will come Friday when the Commerce Department releases the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index data for May. The PCE index, which measured 2.7% in April, is the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/economy/us-consumer-confidence-june/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

Many people believe it\u2019s an astounding $18 after a post on X of McDonald\u2019s menu prices at a rest stop in Connecticut went viral and made national headlines. (Narrator voice: It\u2019s not.) Now, almost a year after the post, a top McDonald\u2019s executive wants to set the record straight. In a recent letter, Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald\u2019s USA, said $18 for a Big Mac combo was the \u201cexception\u201d and not the norm across all 13,700 restaurants in the country. The thing is: It doesn\u2019t really matter that virtually no one is paying anything close to $18 for a Big Mac combo. (On average, it actually costs $9.29, per a fact sheet McDonald\u2019s put out along with the letter.) What matters is that the post struck a nerve with an army of people who are fed up with what fast food costs these days. Erlinger is clearly taking note. A few weeks after publishing the letter the company announced a $5 value menu. But make no mistake \u2014 the timing isn\u2019t a coincidence. A bragging point For years after Covid, fast food chains were bragging on earnings calls about the ease at which they could raise prices without consumers batting much of an eye. Yes, fast-food chains\u2019 expenses went up as inflation accelerated and they had to shell out more money to attract workers. But it\u2019s not like they were hurting as a result. As they increased prices, profits went up. Of course, that was only true because consumers were willing to pay more as their paychecks rose and they were sitting on loads of savings accumulated during the pandemic. Turning tides Now chains like McDonald\u2019s, which didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment, are playing defense. They\u2019re retroactively defending prior increases, telling customers: I understand your frustration \u2013 while also telling them: We aren\u2019t the villains your social media posts make us out to be. \u201cThe average price of a Big Mac in the US was $4.39 in 2019,\u201d Erlinger said in his recent letter. \u201cDespite a global pandemic and historic rises in supply chain costs, wages and other inflationary pressures in the years that followed, the average cost is now $5.29. That\u2019s an increase of 21% (not 100%),\u201d he added. If that\u2019s the case, a 21% price increase from 2019 is less than the 23% overall rise in prices across goods and services over the same period calculated by the Consumer Price Index. On top of this, prices for all manner of goods and services have surged. For instance, car insurance costs for the average US consumer are up more than 40% from 2019 to now, according to CPI data. People aren\u2019t happy about that, but I have yet to see a viral post about car insurance prices. Perhaps that\u2019s because car insurance companies haven\u2019t spent their lifespans positioning themselves as a dirt-cheap good for the common folk. Behold: Price cuts and value menus I\u2019d be willing to bet Erlinger was made aware of the viral $18 Big Mac combo post not long after it took off. So why did it take a year for him to comment on it? Profit margins. McDonald\u2019s CEO Christopher Kempczinski told analysts on the company\u2019s April earnings call that restaurant profit margins have fallen back to where they were in 2019. That\u2019s because consumers are reaching their breaking points with the price increases they\u2019ve had to shoulder over the past four years. And with paycheck bumps flattening out and savings vanishing, it\u2019s stinging a lot more. \u201cWe certainly are going to be prudent and thoughtful about any further price increases that we\u2019re looking at for the rest of 2024 on that backdrop,\u201d Ian Borden, McDonald\u2019s CFO added on the call. Hence why McDonald\u2019s is rolling out a $5 menu. But they\u2019re not the only ones making a pivot. Target, Walgreens, Amazon, Walmart, Wendy\u2019s and Starbucks are slashing prices on thousands of items, trying to win back the customers they, too, have lost due to price increases. Customers are fed up. And it\u2019s finally starting to hurt companies\u2019 bottom lines.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/business/outrage-usd18-big-mac-consumer-revolt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_business_japan-pufferfish-cup-noodles-release-intl-hnk", "text": "Pufferfish is regarded as a luxury in Japan and a meal featuring the potentially poisonous delicacy can easily cost up to 20,000 yen ($125) at high-end restaurants. But now, adventurous foodies in Japan can get a taste of \u201cfugu\u201d for a fraction of the price, from a Cup Noodle. Japanese instant noodle giant Nissin Foods released the new pufferfish flavor on Monday, expanding its massive lineup. The noodles sell for a recommended price of 298 yen ($1.90). The \u201cessence\u201d of pufferfish is condensed into a small packet of oil to be added to the soup base, Nissin said in a statement on its website, though it did not divulge how the potentially deadly flavoring is prepared. \u201cIn recent years \u2026 ramen shops specializing in fugu ramen have been popping up, grabbing the hearts of many ramen fans,\u201d it said. A Nissin spokesperson told CNN it has no plans to sell the fugu flavor outside Japan. Each cup comes with dried chicken meatballs, spring onions and Japanese-style shredded egg in a\u00a0soup base enriched by a dash of yuzu, according to the statement. A CNN journalist who tried the instant noodles said it tasted of seafood broth and yuzu, a citrus fruit commonly used in Japanese cooking. Fugu generally has a mild flavor, which wasn\u2019t prominent in the dish. Nissin was founded in 1958 by Momofuku Ando, who saw a need for cheap, accessible food amid shortages following the end of World War II. The company has since expanded into an international household name synonymous with its signature Cup Noodles. The company posted revenue of more than 732 billion yen ($4.59 billion) in the year to March 2024. While pufferfish, served regularly as sashimi or in hot pot, is a prized item in the Japanese culinary world, almost all of them are poisonous and could, in serious cases, cause death if not properly prepared. The fish\u2019s organs, skin, blood and bones contain high concentrations of tetrodotoxin, a deadly poison.\u00a0Eating it can cause tingling around the mouth and dizziness, which may be followed by convulsions, respiratory paralysis and death, medical experts say. According to Western Australia\u2019s Department of Fisheries, pufferfish, which are found in tropical and subtropical ocean waters,\u00a0are the second most poisonous vertebrate in the world after the golden poison frog, which is native to Colombia. Chefs in Japan must train for at least two years before being allowed to take an examination to qualify to prepare fugu. In 2018, a supermarket in Gamagori city, in Japan\u2019s central Aichi prefecture, issued an alert after two people consumed potentially dangerous fugu products they bought from a supermarket. The pair did not report any health problems, but authorities found that a licensed employee had failed to remove the fish\u2019s poisonous livers. The Japanese delicacy has also been gaining traction overseas in recent years, though it has caused the occasional food scare. In 2020, three people died in the Philippines after they ate pufferfish from a barbecue stand. An elderly couple in Malaysia died last year after eating pufferfish, prompting an appeal from their daughter for stricter regulations. The two, in their early 80s, unknowingly purchased at least two pufferfish from an online vendor and died after consuming them.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/business/japan-pufferfish-cup-noodles-release-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

On Tuesday, Nvidia closed nearly 7% higher, reversing course after three straight days of declines, which caused some investors to worry that the excitement over the crucial role the company is expected to play in the artificial intelligence revolution may be cooling. \u201cWhile we do believe in AI, there have been signs of over-exuberance in the US market over the last month,\u201d Jim Reid, a research strategist at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note Monday. On June 18, the chipmaking giant\u2019s market capitalization hit $3.34 trillion, surpassing Microsoft\u2019s to become the world\u2019s most valuable company. Over the next three trading days, though, the company shed $430 billion. Despite the rally in Nvidia\u2019s shares on Tuesday, Nvidia\u2019s market cap now stands at $3.10 trillion, falling to third place, behind Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), which have market caps of $3.35 trillion and $3.21 trillion, respectively. \u201cWhat we see with Nvidia is typical volatility, which is expected when a stock rises as quickly as Nvidia\u2019s did,\u201d Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at trading platform CMC Markets, told CNN. Nvidia\u2019s stock has been on a tear, soaring more than 161% since January. The company\u2019s chips power AI systems, including generative AI, the technology behind OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT that can create text, images and other media. Market contagion? Frenzy around the potential for AI to radically change the way we live and work \u2014\u00a0and make big returns for investors \u2014 has driven much of the stock market\u2019s returns over the past year and a half. Nvidia is a member of the so-called Magnificent Seven, the mega-cap tech companies whose shares greatly outperformed the broader US stock market rally last year. The S&P 500 index climbed 24.2% over 2023, compared with the more than 100% average rise in the stocks of the Magnificent Seven. In a note published Monday, Deutsche Bank noted that, as a result of the seven stocks\u2019 dominance, \u201cthe US stock market is close to being the most concentrated in history.\u201d On Tuesday, the bank wrote that the decline in Nvidia\u2019s stock the previous day had \u201cheld down US equity returns more broadly.\u201d On Tuesday, Nvidia\u2019s rally helped lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which rose 1.3%.

{"id": "2024_06_20_cars_bugatti-horsepower-hybrid", "text": "Bugatti has unveiled its new model, the Bugatti Tourbillon, a massively powerful hybrid with an equally impressive price tag. The car will replace the $3.3 million, 1,500 horsepower Bugatti Chiron. You might have expected Bugatti\u2019s new model to be all-electric. Not only is the industry headed in that direction, but in 2021 Bugatti was spun off from Volkswagen Group and merged with Rimac, the Croatian company that makes the all-electric Rimac Nevera supercar. But Mate Rimac, the chief executive of the new company, now called Bugatti Rimac, said he never had any intention of making an all-electric Bugatti. As gasoline-powered cars gradually fade from the world\u2019s roads, Bugatti Rimac\u2019s engineers and designers wanted to create something that retained the spirit of mechanically powered Bugatti cars, just better: An insanely powerful plug-in hybrid. Like the Bugatti Chiron and Veyron models before it, the new Bugatti Tourbillon will have a huge, 16-cylinder gas engine. The engine, which was designed in cooperation with the British race car engineering firm Cosworth, will be assisted by three powerful electric motors. One motor in the back of the car and two more in the front will be capable of producing at least 800 horsepower on their own. In total, the Bugatti Tourbillon will be able to put out at least 1,800 horsepower, according to Bugatti Rimac. The electric motors will help make up for the new gas engine\u2019s lack of turbochargers. The Chiron\u2019s gas engine had four turbochargers that pushed air into the engine to help it produce more power. Mate Rimac said they wanted this new engine to be \u201cnaturally aspirated,\u201d meaning there would be no turbochargers. \u201cWe wanted to make the most exciting, most emotional combustion engine possible,\u201d Rimac said, \u201cand that is high revving, naturally aspirated.\u201d The car\u2019s interior is, likewise, an homage to old-fashioned machinery. The Tourbillon is named after a set of gears that helps maintain accuracy in a mechanical watch. The Bugatti\u2019s instrument display is modeled on mechanical watch dials. \u201cOne of the first things we did when the new company was formed, I took the whole team to Switzerland and we visited a few watchmakers,\u201d Rimac told CNN. The central speedometer display even has two needles like the hands of a clock. The long hand shows the car\u2019s speed while the short hand registers the revolutions per minute of the high-revving 16-cylinder engine. With a fully charged battery, the car will be able to travel about 37 miles on purely electric power before the gas engine needs to turn on, but the driver will have the option to run the gas engine continuously, if they wish. Unlike past Bugattis, though, the Tourbillon does have a reasonably large display screen with Apple CarPlay available. The screen will only come out and become visible when the driver requests it, though. In general, Bugatti designers have avoided putting screens in the cars in the belief that computer displays look outmoded quickly. \u201cWe think, really, how will this product look in 50 years, 100 years,\u201d said Rimac. \u201cAnd it\u2019s clear that, if you have a screen, it won\u2019t look that great.\u201d The cars will still be assembled one at a time at Bugatti\u2019s small factory in Molsheim, France. A total of only 250 Tourbillons will be built, Mate Rimac said, at a starting price of roughly $4 million each.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/cars/bugatti-horsepower-hybrid/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

The latest recall, which includes almost all of the nearly 12,000 trucks on the road so far, involves the truck\u2019s huge single windshield wiper and a piece of plastic trim along the edge of the truck bed. A piece of black plastic trim that runs along the edge of the truck\u2019s angled bed wall can come loose and may detach from the vehicle while it\u2019s being driven. \u201cIf the applique separates from the vehicle while in drive, it could create a road hazard for following motorists and increase their risk of injury or a collision,\u201d according to documents posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration web site. The problem emerged when the piece was missing on a Cybertruck that had been transported to a delivery center on a car hauler truck, according to NHTSA documents. An investigation by Tesla revealed that the piece had not been properly installed. Further investigation revealed more cases of the trim pieces coming loose because of improper installation. Some of these cases were on Cybertrucks that had been delivered to customers. Cybertruck owners will be asked to bring their trucks to a Tesla service center where the trim piece will either be replaced or installed properly with \u201cadhesion promotor\u201d and pressure sensitive tape. Tesla will begin notifying owners of the recall in mid-August. The trucks are also being recalled for a separate issue in the electric motor that powers the truck\u2019s single huge windshield wiper. Some of the motors were damaged during testing in a way that can allow excessive electrical current to run through the motor, causing it to fail. Tesla has previously recalled the Cybertruck for other issues. In April the trucks were recalled because the accelerator pedal could become stuck down. In January, Tesla issued a software recall for 2.2 million vehicles, including Cybertrucks, because letters on warning lights were too small to easily read. That problem was fixed through an over-the-air software update.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/cars/tesla-recalling-cybertruck/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

The recall involves the \u201cMake it Mini\u201d sets which contain resins that, when liquid, can cause those injuries and irritations to young children and adults alike. The CPSC also found that the resins contain chemical compounds called \u201cacrylates\u201d\u00a0in amounts that are prohibited in children\u2019s products. After the resins cure (or turn into a solid form), however, they no longer present this hazard, the agency said.

The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_business_car-dealership-cdk-cyber-attack", "text": "A CDK Global system outage has affected nearly every aspect of the Mazda dealership in Seekonk, Massachusetts, where Ryan Callahan is general sales manager. He says it won\u2019t be a simple fix. \u201cThe financial impact it will directly have on us will take months to correct, if not years,\u201d Callahan said. Car buyers and dealers are grappling with the shutdown of the retail software provider, which has left nearly 15,000 car dealerships across North America struggling to provide services to customers and scrambling to find temporary analog solutions to operate. CDK says it\u2019s working on restoring its systems and expects them to be back online in several days, but in the interim, customers and dealership employees remain beset by long wait times, delays \u2013 and missed chances to make or save money. Tom McParland, the owner of Automatic Consulting, a national car buying service, said the outage was impacting customers because they have fewer dealers to choose from. \u201cIt reduces their ability to get a deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt limits the customer\u2019s leverage.\u201d Some dealers also can\u2019t apply factory rebates without CDK\u2019s software, so customers may miss out on money-saving deals. For customers looking to buy a car, McParland suggested casting a wide net and shopping outside their local market to find the best price. \u2018They aren\u2019t really able to drive their cars\u2019 Midway Automotive uses a CDK product to register cars with the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles. Owner Michael Deveney says that after the shutdown on Wednesday, the dealership started sending customers to their local RMV office in order to register their cars in person after purchase. \u201cThat was up until Thursday. Then customers started being told that (the RMV) wasn\u2019t taking any walk-ins,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were probably getting flooded with customers and started turning people away.\u201d Deveney said one customer got increasingly agitated because he couldn\u2019t register his car. \u201cGetting an appointment might take three or four days, and in that time they aren\u2019t really able to drive their cars,\u201d he added. Some 30 miles north in Lynn, Katelyn Salvato says she hasn\u2019t been able to register a vehicle since last Tuesday. Salvato works as a title clerk for Pride Motor Group, registering cars for three dealerships. \u201cToday\u2026 I sent 21 registrations to be done manually at the Massachusetts RMV,\u201d she said, adding that the RMV won\u2019t accept transactions from dealership employees. \u201cThe transactions must be dropped off within the designated hours (of 10 am to 3 pm), and the runner can\u2019t wait for them.\u201d  Callahan echoed those concerns. Under normal circumstances, the CDK software allows the dealership to register a vehicle almost instantaneously, but now the process faces heavy delays. \u201cOur remote registration system is rendered useless without CDK to talk to it. We\u2019ve had to send a runner with the registrations to the DMV to be competed in packs, costing several days where prior it took hours,\u201d Callahan said in an interview with CNN. If a vehicle isn\u2019t registered within seven days of purchase, the state penalizes both the dealership and customers. The Massachusetts Department of Transportation, which oversees the state\u2019s RMV, has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Service and sales go analog Salespeople and service employees who spoke with CNN say they\u2019ve resorted to using pen and paper to process purchases, which has drawn out the amount of time it takes to buy a car, according to Scott Campbell, a salesman at Capital City Buick GMC in Berlin, Vermont. He estimates wait times have doubled or tripled. Nicolas, who declined to provide his full name because he was unsure about his employer\u2019s stance on speaking to the media, is a clerk in the parts department of a Porsche dealership in Los Angeles. He said he has been using \u201ca mix of pen and paper, Excel sheets, and extra care for each invoice\u201d since the shutdown. Since many dealerships use CDK products to manage inventory, Nicolas said his department is now forced to manually record inventory parts, which slows their work down significantly. \u201cWe don\u2019t have clear view of stock and have to do regular inventory on our most used parts,\u201d he added. But sometimes the analog workarounds are not enough. Delays at dealerships Several buyers and repair customers tell CNN they\u2019ve experienced long delays. Don Aycock told CNN he drove 90 miles round-trip from his home to a car dealership in Clay County, Florida, to buy a new Buick on Thursday, a day after the CDK shutdown. He told CNN he was able to buy the car but was unable to sign the title. \u201cWe got a call from them today that we can come next Thursday to sign the paperwork for the title and get a permanent license plate,\u201d he said, noting that it will be another lengthy round-trip drive. In San Diego \u2014 where temperatures in recent days have been pushing 90 degrees \u2014 Robbie Jacob and his wife tried to make an appointment at a Kia service center to fix their car\u2019s broken air conditioning unit. Jacob said the center told them it was unable to service the car, citing the CDK cyber incident, as there were no appointments available and all walk-ins were suspended until next week. Other software providers take note CDK Global isn\u2019t the only management system used by dealerships, and the back-to-back cyber incidents affecting the company have put their competitors on high alert, as well. Cox Automotive, which operates the Dealertrack and VinSolutions software systems to manage documents and customer service, told CNN that it temporarily stopped integrating its systems with CDK after the outage \u201cas a precautionary measure to prioritize safety and security for our clients.\u201d \u201cWhile actively supporting our customers to continue to run their business, we established a secure microsite that our customers are actively using now to access support and guidance, work-arounds and actions they can take while CDK systems are not available,\u201d the company said. Tekion, another software company used by dealerships, said it has \u201cseen an increase in inquiries from dealers in light of the recent CDK incident.\u201d And other industry experts told CNN that switching from one system to another is not an action that dealerships can just take on a whim. Businesses are often locked into a multi-year contract with a software provider. Switching software also means training employees, making it a lengthy process. Meanwhile, Asbury Automotive Group, one of America\u2019s largest care retailers and service providers, warned investors Monday that the CDK outage has hurt its business, and it\u2019s unclear when it will end. Rival Group1 Automotive said CDK believed the outage would be resolved in days, not weeks, but it was unclear how much financial damage the company faced as a result.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/business/car-dealership-cdk-cyber-attack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

Earlier this month, a bankruptcy judge ruled that Jones\u2019 personal assets would be liquidated to help pay off the nearly $1.5 billion he owes the families of victims of the Sandy Hook massacre. But\u00a0at that time, the judge ruled Jones\u2019\u00a0media company Free Speech Systems, the\u00a0parent\u00a0of Infowars, would not be liquidated partly because the process would be costly and lengthy. The dismissal of the bankruptcy case against the outlet meant that the families were free to go after Jones\u2019 assets, including Infowars, in state court.\u00a0Since Jones is the owner of\u00a0Free Speech Systems, a court appointed trustee was put in charge of the company. The trustee wrote on Sunday that since being appointed, he \u201cbegan planning to wind-up\u00a0(Free Speech Systems\u2019)\u00a0operations and liquidate its inventory.\u201d But the trustee\u00a0said the\u00a0process was \u201cderailed\u201d when\u00a0one\u00a0of the Sandy Hook\u00a0victim\u2019s parents\u00a0filed a motion in a Texas District Court to be granted custody of all of\u00a0Free Speech Systems\u2019\u00a0assets, including Infowars. As a result, Jones\u2019 trustee\u00a0asked the\u00a0bankruptcy judge for an emergency stay in\u00a0the\u00a0case to allow them to conduct an \u201corderly wind-down and sale process\u201d of Infowars. In a statement,\u00a0Christopher Mattei,\u00a0an attorney for\u00a0Sandy Hook families from Connecticut who were in favor of liquidating\u00a0the company, said \u201cthis is precisely the unfortunate situation that the Connecticut families hoped to avoid when we argued that the Free Speech Systems/InfoWars case should have remained with the bankruptcy court rather than being dismissed.\u201d \u201cThe Connecticut families are disappointed by this attempt to undercut the orderly and long overdue wind down of Alex Jones\u2019 InfoWars platform,\u201d Mattei said, referring to the attempt by one set of parents to go after FSS assets. \u201cFrom the beginning, they have led with dignity toward a resolution that is fair for every family and are grateful that the Chapter 7 Trustee has already filed a motion \u2013 with which eight of the nine families agree \u2013 supporting an equitable distribution of the FSS assets.\u201d Jones, who had\u00a0earlier this month\u00a0celebrated the judge\u2019s ruling\u00a0not to liquidate\u00a0Infowars\u2019 parent company, has acknowledged Infowars would likely only continue broadcasting for a few more months. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to move forward and maximize the amount of money we can make at Info\ufeffwars to then have a wind-down,\u201d Jones said outside the courthouse after the hearing dismissing his company\u2019s liquidation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/media/alex-jones-infowars-court-trustee/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_25_business_ntsb-findings-ohio-derailment", "text": "Norfolk Southern on Tuesday faced harsh criticism from regulators for its decisions immediately after a February 2023 derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. During an all-day hearing in the town itself, hosted by the National Transportation Safety Board, the harshest criticism focused on the railroad\u2019s advocating for a controlled explosion and burn of five tank cars full of vinyl chloride, a toxic chemical three days after the derailment. Norfolk Southern told public officials who authorized the controlled burn, known as a vent and burn procedure, that it was the only way to prevent a catastrophic and uncontrolled explosion. But the NTSB staff and board members insisted at the hearing Tuesday that was not the case. Paul Stancil, an NTSB hazardous materials investigator, said that representatives from Oxy Vinyl, the shipper who owned the five tank cars of vinyl chloride, did not believe the procedure was justified by the facts available at the time. But Stancil said that information was not communicated to the public officials who had to make the final decision. \u201cNorfolk Southern\u2026 compromised the integrity of the vent and burn decision by withholding complete and accurate expert opinion and information from the incident commander,\u201d Stancil said. \u201cVent and burn is a seldom-used procedure,\u201d he continued. \u201c(It) should only be used when there is a high probability of catastrophic tank shell failure.\u201d He said that was not the case here, as evidence from the scene showed no evidence that an uncontrolled explosion was likely. In a statement, Norfolk Southern defended the decision, stating it made the recommendation based on the best available information at the time and that it did not withhold any information. \u201cThe NTSB mischaracterized the basis of the recommendation,\u201d said the railroad\u2019s statement. \u201cSeveral key factors indicated the strong possibility of a catastrophic, uncontrolled explosion.\u201d \u201cThe vent and burn effectively avoided a potential uncontrolled explosion,\u201d Norfolk said elsewhere in its statement. \u201cThere was no loss of life, injuries, or damage to property, and contractors took steps to manage environmental impact.\u201d NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy harshly criticized Norfolk\u2019s statement, calling it \u201cinsulting\u201d and an attempt to shift blame to the public officials who listened to Norfolk\u2019s recommendation. The public officials \u201cdid absolutely nothing wrong, who did a phenomenal job with the limited information they had in a very chaotic situation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting that anyone would say that.\u201d Previously, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio and others had suggested the rail company wanted the controlled burn because that would be faster than draining the cars, which would enable Norfolk Southern to resume operations faster. Homendy said Tuesday said that Norfolk Southern executives met with board members and argued the NTSB should \u201cput to rest the quote-unquote rumor that Norfolk Southern made the decision to vent and burn in order to move trains.\u201d \u201cIt is not our role to defend Norfolk Southern. We\u2019re here to protect the American people and the traveling public,\u201d she said. Homendy said that she was \u201cdeeply troubled by how NS conducted this investigation,\u201d including delaying or not providing information and said she twice threatened to issue subpoenas to get information. The railroad\u2019s actions during the investigation were, Homendy said, \u201cunprecedented and reprehensible.\u201d Norfolk Southern said in a statement Tuesday that it \u201ccooperated fully and ethically with the investigation, with full transparency.\u201d \u201cOur communications with NTSB staff and board members were always motivated by a desire to ensure they had all the relevant information for their independent evaluation and by a shared commitment to advance rail safety,\u201d the company said.

{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}

This will \u201cdrag countries \u2026 into a vicious cycle of scrambling for a cake that becomes smaller and smaller,\u201d Li added. \u201cThis is something that we don\u2019t want to see.\u201d The remarks by China\u2019s second most powerful leader after Xi Jinping come a day after Canada became the latest Western country to consider imposing tariffs on EVs made in China. The Canadian government said on Monday that its workers faced \u201cunfair competition\u201d from Beijing\u2019s \u201cstate-directed policy of overcapacity.\u201d It will begin a 30-day public consultation period next month to assess possible responses. Last month, the Biden administration\u00a0quadrupled tariffs\u00a0on EV imports from China, from 25% to 100%, aiming to protect American jobs and manufacturing. Chinese EV sales to the United States are tiny. However, the challenges facing China\u2019s EV makers grew when a much larger market followed suit weeks later. The European Union (EU), the biggest overseas buyer of Chinese EVs, announced additional provisional tariffs earlier this month because of what it called Beijing\u2019s unfair support for companies that undercut European carmakers. The two sides have agreed to start talks to negotiate on a possible compromise before the duties come into full effect in November, according to Reuters. The best outcome would be for the EU to scrap its decision altogether before July 4, when the tariffs begin to kick in, outspoken Chinese state media outlet Global Times reported on Sunday. China\u2019s growing trade woes come against the backdrop of a sluggish economy, weighed down by its all-important real estate sector, which once accounted for as much as 30% of economic activity. But Li struck an upbeat tone at the gathering of global executives. He took the opportunity to pitch China as a place to do business, saying it was a \u201clarge open market.\u201d The premier said the economy had shown \u201cpromising signs of recovery\u201d early in the year, with \u201cstrong\u201d growth of 5.3% in the first quarter. \u201cThis positive momentum is expected to continue through the second quarter, and we have both the confidence and the capacity to achieve our annual economic growth target of approximately 5%,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/economy/china-li-qiang-economic-decoupling-warning-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_tech_new-york-hochul-social-media-algorithms-children", "text": "Big changes are coming for New York\u2019s youngest social media users after Gov. Kathy Hochul signed two bills into law Thursday clamping down on digital platforms\u2019 algorithms and use of children\u2019s data. The unprecedented move makes New York the first state to pass a law regulating social media algorithms amid nationwide allegations that apps such as Instagram or TikTok have hooked users with addictive features. Hochul\u2019s signature comes days after US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called for warning labels to be applied to social media platforms, fueling a debate about social media\u2019s potential impact on the mental health of users, particularly teens. Under New York\u2019s SAFE For Kids Act, social media platforms will be required to display content chronologically by default for kids under 18, while the New York Child Data Protection Act will restrict websites from collecting or sharing the personal data of users under 18 without consent \u2014 expanding on existing federal privacy protections for children under 13. The SAFE For Kids Act also requires platforms to limit late-night app notifications that state lawmakers say are engineered to drive user engagement and that risk hindering sleep. Both pieces of legislation were introduced last fall and cleared the state legislature in early June. New York officials hailed the legislation as a critical check on social media platforms\u2019 influence over teens. \u201cToday, we save our children,\u201d Hochul said Thursday at a press conference. \u201cWe have heard their cries for help, reminding us as adults that we have a moral responsibility to protect young New Yorkers from harm and from addictive forces.\u201d In a statement Thursday afternoon, a Meta spokesperson said, \u201cWhile we don\u2019t agree with every aspect of these bills, we welcome New York becoming the first state to pass legislation recognizing the responsibility of app stores.\u201d \u201cAccording to research, the vast majority of parents support legislation requiring app stores to obtain parental approval to download apps, and we will continue to work with policymakers in New York and elsewhere to advance this approach,\u201d the spokesperson said. CNN has reached out to Google, Snap and TikTok for comment. Some academics have said that while studies highlight associations between specific types of social media activities and negative mental health outcomes \u2013 such as engaging in social comparison \u2013 a causal link between those harms and general social media use is less clear. Still, numerous states and federal lawmakers have pushed for legislation clamping down on social media platforms, arguing that tech companies\u2019 products are to blame for eating disorders, sleeplessness, distraction and, in some cases, self-harm and suicide. \u201cWe will save lives with this, my friends,\u201d Hochul said at Thursday\u2019s press conference. New York Attorney General Letitia James added Thursday that the legislation would take on \u201cthe most dangerous aspects of social media, the addictive algorithm feeds that exploit impressionable minds.\u201d \u201cThese bills will empower my office to set rules and ensure companies are following them,\u201d James said. Opponents of the social media algorithm bill \u2014 including but not limited to the tech industry \u2014 have said the legislation is likely unconstitutional because it infringes on children\u2019s First Amendment rights and raises other questions about how social media can function in practice across state lines. \u201cIt\u2019s a well-intentioned effort, but it\u2019s aimed at the wrong target,\u201d said Adam Kovacevich, CEO of the tech industry advocacy group Chamber of Progress. \u201cAlgorithmic curation makes teenagers\u2019 feeds healthier, and banning algorithms is going to make social media worse for teens.\u201d The legislation\u2019s signing sets the stage for another in a long string of court battles over state social media laws. States such as Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana and many others have passed laws clamping down on social media companies\u2019 approach to teens. Industry groups have challenged some of that legislation, and courts have largely viewed the laws with skepticism. In Ohio this year, for example, a federal judge temporarily blocked a law prohibiting online platforms from creating accounts for users under 16 unless they obtain parental consent, saying the legislation likely violates the First Amendment. Two states, Texas and Florida, have passed laws that would restrict online platforms from moderating their sites; legal challenges reached the Supreme Court this term and a decision is expected within weeks.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/tech/new-york-hochul-social-media-algorithms-children/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/26/2024", "section": "business"}}
