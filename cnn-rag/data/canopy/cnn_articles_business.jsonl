Julie Inman Grant had sought a Federal Court ruling after X failed to fully comply with a takedown order issued under the country\u2019s Online Safety Act following the incident in April. Instead, Inman Grant said Wednesday she would \u201cconsolidate action\u201d concerning the removal notice in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT),\u00a0an independent review process that examines decisions taken by the commissioner. \u201cAfter weighing multiple considerations, including litigation across multiple cases, I have considered this option likely to achieve the most positive outcome for the online safety of all Australians, especially children,\u201d she said in a statement. The eSafety commissioner had wanted X to hide the video for users beyond Australian borders. Musk criticized the request as an excessive overreach by an unelected official that could set a precedent for other countries to demand the removal of sensitive material. \u201cOur concern is that if ANY country is allowed to censor content for ALL countries, which is what the Australian \u2018eSafety Commissar\u2019 is demanding, then what is to stop any country from controlling the entire Internet?\u201d\u00a0Musk posted on X in April. In a statement, X welcomed the latest development as a victory for free speech. \u201cThis case has raised important questions on how legal powers can be used to threaten global censorship of speech, and we are heartened to see that freedom of speech has prevailed,\u201d it said. Joanne Gray, a lecturer in digital cultures at the University of Sydney, said the decision to drop the case was \u201crational\u201d for a public institution with limited resources.\u00a0But she added that the question of Australia\u2019s jurisdiction over online content remains unanswered. \u201c[Musk] might claim it\u2019s a victory for free speech but I don\u2019t think that is really what it is. It\u2019s more of a corporate win, and says more about the ability of platform companies to operate outside of the reach of governments,\u201d Gray said. She said the end of the legal action demonstrates the need for a global approach to online regulation, adding that \u201cit\u2019s hard for Australia to fix these issues when it\u2019s acting alone.\u201d The controversial video showed the moment Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel was stabbed, allegedly by a 16-year-old assailant, while delivering a sermon at the Christ the Good Shepherd Church in western Sydney. The incident set off a riot outside the church that authorities said was stoked by the rapid distribution of the video online. However, in court filings, lawyers for X argued that it had taken down some URLs seen by an Australian audience, but the video was readily available to view on other sites. \u201cThe Video is, and at all material times has been, widely accessible to persons in Australia other than on the X platform, including in its full form on other social media services and various websites,\u201d court documents said. Musk\u2019s lawyers also said the commissioner had failed to consider that the video was shared with the bishop\u2019s consent, not by his assailant. The\u00a0Assyrian\u00a0Orthodox cleric was quoted in court filings as supporting the distribution of the video as an exercise in free speech. \u201cNoting our God given right to freedom of speech and freedom of religion, I am not opposed to [the video] remaining on social media,\u201d the bishop said, according to court documents. In her statement Wednesday, Inman Grant defended her decision to pursue the matter, which she said had given the agency\u00a0an opportunity to test its \u201cnovel regulatory powers \u2026 to protect Australians from online harm.\u201d \u201cOur sole goal and focus in issuing our removal notice was to prevent this extremely violent footage from going viral, potentially inciting further violence and inflicting more harm on the Australian community. I stand by my investigators and the decisions eSafety made,\u201d the statement said. Inman Grant told Australia\u2019s national broadcaster, the ABC, that she\u2019d been subject to personal attacks, including death threats, from Musk\u2019s supporters. \u201cTargeting a regulator who is here to protect the citizens of Australia is really beyond the pale, but it\u2019s not surprising,\u201d she reportedly told the ABC. X, formerly known as Twitter, has faced ongoing scrutiny over the spread of controversial content on the platform, including hateful speech and conspiracy theories, since it was taken over by Musk in 2022. Last month, the platform named a new head of safety, nine months after its previous safety leader resigned following just seven months in the role.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/media/australia-esafety-drops-x-legal-action-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_business_ny-gov-hochul-delays-indefinitely-controversial-nyc-congestion-pricing-plan", "text": "New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced Wednesday she is indefinitely delaying the implementation of congestion pricing in New York City\u2019s borough of Manhattan just weeks before the plan was set to take effect, dealing a major blow to transportation advocates who have spent decades pushing for the deal and a win for several opponents of the plan who say the toll is a regressive tax on commuters. \u201cAfter careful consideration I have come to the difficult decision that implementing the planned congestion system risks too many unintended consequences for New Yorkers at this time,\u201d Hochul said during a video briefing from her office in Manhattan. A source familiar with the Governor\u2019s plan said Hochul pushed for the delay due to concerns about affordability and the potential impact to the city\u2019s post-pandemic economic recovery. New York\u2019s congestion pricing would have been the first of its kind in the United States. Similar programs have been implemented in London and Stockholm. The New York City version has been years in the making and was scheduled to begin June 30th. As part of the plan, drivers would have paid $15 to enter Manhattan south of 60th\u00a0street, with commercial vehicles and trucks paying steeper tolls. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which approved the plan in March and would have been in charge of implementation, declined to comment. John Samuelsen, international president of the Transport Workers Union which represents many of the city\u2019s transit workers accused Hochul of political malpractice, telling CNN Hochul bowed to pressure. \u201cThis was going to be a disaster for Hochul at the ballot, and the plan is bleeding into the Dem\u2019s efforts to take back the House,\u201d Samuelsen told CNN. The plan was intended to help raise revenue for critical transportation upgrades and maintenance. Over the years it would have helped improve the city\u2019s old subway system and improve other public transit options around the city and its surrounding communities. According to a second source familiar with the Governor\u2019s plan, Hochul believes the timing of the implementation is not ideal, and believes its implementation would deter commuters from returning to Manhattan\u2019s central business district. Congestion pricing has been fiercely opposed by some members in the state legislature and New York\u2019s congressional delegation, including some who represent districts outside the five boroughs and worry the toll will result in political backlash from their constituents in a crucial election year, which was part of the governor\u2019s calculus in opting for the delay, the sources said. Members of the State legislature are expected to be briefed throughout the day, according to two sources. City Councilmember Joe Borelli, a Republican who represents parts of Staten Island where the plan is deeply unpopular, said the governor\u2019s decision was blatantly political. \u201cThe political calculus has always been the same \u2013 it was going to pay off poorly for Democrats, this has always been a wildly unpopular proposal that was only supported by a very vocal minority in the city, mainly the anti-car bike bros in the city,\u201d Borelli told CNN. \u201cDemocrats are in a tailspin nationally and now Hochul is flip-flopping on a state-wide poison pill that affects places in the heart of where Democrats need to take back the house \u2013 Long Island and the Hudson Valley, where this is hugely unpopular,\u201d he said. Reaction was quick to pour in Wednesday, including from some members of New York\u2019s congressional delegation. Rep. Ritchie Torres, who represents parts of the Bronx, told CNN he was blindsided by the decision. Rep. Jerry Nadler, a Democrat who represents crucial districts in parts of Brooklyn where the plan has support, was critical of Hochul\u2019s decision. \u201cAs a longtime champion of Congestion Pricing and the Congressional Representative of a significant portion of the Central Business District (CBD), I am disappointed by reports that Governor Hochul will not implement Congestion Pricing on June 30, as previously planned,\u201d Nadler said in a statement. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who represents a congressional district that largely covers a swathe of southern Brooklyn, sought to take a middle path. \u201cFor years, Leader Hakeem Jeffries has maintained neutrality with respect to the congestion pricing policy debate. Nothing has changed in that regard,\u201d spokesperson Andy Eichar said in a statement. \u201cTo the extent immediate implementation of congestion pricing is being reconsidered, Leader Jeffries supports a temporary pause of limited duration to better understand the financial impact on working class New Yorkers who have confronted a challenging inflationary environment as a result of the pandemic. We will continue to find ways to lower costs for everyday Americans and strengthen mass transportation in New York State,\u201d Eichar added. Transportation Alternatives, one of the key advocate group which support the plan were critical of the delay. \u201cDelaying congestion pricing is a slap in the face to the millions of New Yorkers who rely on public transportation every day just to appease the program\u2019s loudest foes. Congestion pricing is a $15 billion lifeline for the MTA \u2013 critical funding that will be lost if the program is stalled,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cThe next time your train is late, your bus is trapped in traffic, your subway station is still missing an elevator, you know who to blame: Governor Kathy Hochul.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/business/ny-gov-hochul-delays-indefinitely-controversial-nyc-congestion-pricing-plan/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens.

Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions.

The company said on Wednesday that the program will be aimed at rewarding employees who stay with the company long-term, with employees able to earn up to a maximum of $1,000 for those who have been with the company 20 years or more. The company said any hourly store employee who has been with the company for a year or more is eligible for the bonus program, with those full-time employees with at least a year but less than five years getting an annual bonus of $350. The amount of the bonus then increases from there with seniority. Walmart has an outsized impact on the labor market for hourly workers, and has been grappling with finding and retaining the workers it needs in a tight labor market. It said it has raised hourly wages by around 30% over the last five years and that its average US hourly wage now is close to $18. Its starting pay ranges from $14 to $19 depending on the store and local market. A $1,000 bonus comes to just under 50 cents an hour for employees working a 40-hour week and equal to about 3% of annual pay for those full-time workers making that average hourly pay.

{"id": "2024_06_02_media_sally-buzbee-washington-post-executive-editor-leaves-hnk-intl", "text": "The Washington Post announced on Sunday that it had parted ways with its top editor, Sally Buzbee, in a seismic shakeup executed by new publisher and chief executive William Lewis just months before the high-stakes 2024 presidential election. \u201cSally is an incredible leader and a supremely talented media executive who will be sorely missed,\u201d Lewis said in a statement. \u201cI wish her all the best going forward.\u201d While Lewis praised Buzbee publicly on Sunday, she oversaw a particularly tumultuous period at the venerable newspaper. During her three-year tenure, The Post saw much of its audience dissipate. While The Post celebrated several journalism triumphs under Buzbee, winning numerous awards, her tenure was also stained by severe infighting in 2022 that spurred national headlines and embarrassed the newspaper. The Post said that Matt Murray, former editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal, will immediately replace Buzbee as executive editor. Murray will serve in that position through the 2024 presidential election. After the November election, Robert Winnett, deputy editor of The Telegraph Media Group, will take on a new role as editor of The Post, overseeing its core news offering. Murray will then transition to overseeing the formation of a new newsroom at The Post, one which focuses on service and social media journalism. Lewis said the creation of an additional newsroom division represents a \u201cdefinitive step away from the \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach and moving towards meeting our audiences where they are.\u201d The changes to leadership come as Lewis moves quickly to turn around The Post, which soared with audience growth during the chaotic Donald Trump presidency but has since struggled to find its footing. Lewis, who unveiled the main contours of his revival plan last month, disclosed to staffers that the newspaper lost $77 million last year and 50% of its audience since 2020. \u201cTo speak candidly,\u201d Lewis told staffers during a 90-minute meeting, \u201cwe are in a hole, and we have been for some time.\u201d Like Lewis, Murray previously spent much of his career inside Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire. Murray worked at The Wall Street Journal for 29 years, stepping down from the top role at the business broadsheet last year. \u201cI\u2019m deeply honored to join such a storied news institution with its long, rich history of memorable and impactful journalism and want to thank Sally for her great leadership,\u201d Murray said in the statement. \u201cI am excited by Will and Jeff\u2019s vision for The Post\u2019s next era of growth and reinvention and can\u2019t wait to get started.\u201d This story had been updated with new information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/media/sally-buzbee-washington-post-executive-editor-leaves-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}

These service issues are getting old,\u201d said one social media user. \u201cWe better be getting more than a $5 credit. Otherwise I\u2019m going back to Verizon.\u201d Though outages can affect any company, it\u2019s not normal to have two long outages in a short period of time, Mojtaba Vaezi, a professor and director of the Wireless Networking Laboratory at Villanova University, said to CNN. \u201cIf it\u2019s something that\u2019s happening with a software update dysfunctioning with some systems, usually they have back-ups and people working around the clock,\u201d Vaezi said. \u201cWhen it takes longer than 10 to 15 minutes, it is alarming.\u201d Although AT&T did not share the number of impacted customers, website Down Detector shows\u00a0a spike in reports\u00a0of issues using the service starting around 1 pm ET on Tuesday. Those numbers climbed in the hours that followed. By 6 pm ET, however, the number of reported incidents sharply declined, according to Down Detector. The site listed New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, Pittsburgh and Indianapolis as among the cities with the most reports of issues. Because of the problem connecting to other carriers,\u00a0thousands of Verizon customers\u00a0also reported a service outage on Down Detector Tuesday. In a statement Tuesday, AT&T said it had resolved the outage and that calls between AT&T customers were not impacted. In February, a massive outage knocked out service for AT&T\u2019s network for nearly\u00a012 hours. Tens of thousands of AT&T customers in America could not make phone calls, send texts, reach emergency services or access the internet. At the time, the mobile network issued a $5 credit to impacted customers. Impact on customer trust Some subscribers complained that AT&T had waited too long to alert them of the outage, leaving them scrambling to figure out what happened. \u201cIt would be great if AT&T would notify customers of this problem before each of us wastes time trying to figure out what is wrong,\u201d said one Reddit user. Karen North, a communication professor at the University of Southern California who specializes in brand management and crisis communications, said AT&T\u2019s initial lack of communication may damage customer faith in the company. \u201cSilence is almost never the right answer when users are involved. People need to know what\u2019s happening and when it\u2019s going to be fixed,\u201d North said. AT&T told CNN on Tuesday that 911 calls were going through, despite a few locations, including Camden County, Georgia, and Scranton, Pennsylvania, issuing\u00a0alerts\u00a0on social media that the outage was disrupting calls to 911. AT&T told CNN the alerts were received accidentally and the company is investigating why that happened. After two consecutive outages and a March data breach, North said AT&T needs to work to regain customer trust. \u201cThey need to put out a very clear message about why they should be trusted in the future to resolve this,\u201d North said. \u201cAnd they probably need to show empathy for the fact that this isn\u2019t just a phone. This is, professionally and personally, a lifeline for people to their families, their friends and their businesses.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/business/att-outage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}

Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing. Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive. Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year. The stock is one of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that have powered the lion\u2019s share of the market\u2019s returns this year, boosted by Wall Street\u2019s bet that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in tech.

{"id": "2024_06_05_investing_texas-stock-exchange", "text": "Texas\u2019 famous longhorns are coming for Wall Street\u2019s bulls. A new national stock exchange, based in Dallas, and backed by Wall Street heavyweights like BlackRock and Citadel, is looking to take on the world-famous New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. The newly formed TXSE Group announced its plans to file for registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission later this year. The group is backed by more than two dozen investors with $120 million in funding \u2013 that makes it the most well-capitalized exchange entrant to even file with the SEC. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to bring to fruition the long-held vision for a national stock exchange in Texas,\u201d\u00a0TXSE Group founder and CEO James Lee said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cTexas and the other states in the southeast quadrant have become economic powerhouses. Combined with the demand we are seeing from investors and corporations for expanded alternatives to trade and list equities, this is an opportune time to build a major, national stock exchange in Texas.\u201d The group said it was hoping to benefit from the more than 5,200 private equity-sponsored companies in the region that may want to go public. Lee told\u00a0The Wall Street Journal that the group hopes to officially launch its exchange in 2026. The problem with going public America has lost half its public companies since the 1990s. Back in 1996, there were 8,000 companies on US exchanges. Today that count has dropped by more than 50% to just 3,700, according to\u00a0data from\u00a0the Center for Research in Security Prices. It\u2019s not that America has half as many companies as 30 years ago \u2013 it\u2019s that companies are increasingly staying private, largely outside the scrutiny of the public eye and markets. Intensified reporting requirements, higher litigation expenses, costly regulations, overbearing board governance, shareholder activism, heightened public scrutiny and the pressure of quarterly earnings have driven companies away from public markets. There are now about five times as many private equity-backed firms in the US as there are\u00a0publicly held companies, according to economists at Wells Fargo. The trend has been growing for some time. In 1999, the average US technology firm transitioned to the public markets after four years, Wells Fargo research shows. By 2019, that figure increased to 11 years. \u201cCompanies that remain private can avoid the burden and cost of regulatory requirements and focus on long-term strategic plans,\u201d they wrote. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, expressed worry about the changes in his annual shareholder letter in April. \u201cThis trend is serious,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe really need to consider: Is this the outcome we want?\u201d The TXSE Group said in a press release on Wednesday that it hopes to help relieve some of that burden. \u201cTXSE\u2019s planned launch comes as changes in the equity markets provide an opportunity for greater alignment and more competition,\u201d they wrote. \u201cCorporate issuers and exchange-traded product sponsors are demanding more stability and predictability around listing standards and associated costs. TXSE intends to expand access to US capital markets for all investors, while providing greater access and alignment for public companies and those seeking access to public capital.\u201d While the most popular exchanges in the US are located in New York City, there are about 13 stock exchanges around the country including in Philadelphia and Miami. This exchange, said Lee, would mostly function to list businesses located in Texas and the southeast quadrant of the United States.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/investing/texas-stock-exchange/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. The summer months are usually relatively benign for markets as investors opt for sandbars in lieu of bar charts, but that\u2019s not happening this year. The US stock market is shrinking, and investors are pulling their money out at a near-record pace as storm clouds gather over the US economy. That means the titans of Wall Street may have to contend with choppy water as they cruise toward their Nantucket getaways this year. What\u2019s happening: \u201cSell in May and go away\u201d is a popular Wall Street-ism that describes the trend of investors closing up shop and sorting out their portfolios ahead of vacations. It also alludes to the historical underperformance of stocks during the summer months. But recent trading flows show that something larger is at play this year. Bank of America analysts said on Tuesday that their clients have now been large net sellers of US stocks for five weeks in a row. Just last week, they sold off $5.7 billion more in stocks than they purchased, the highest outflow since last July. Bank of America recorded the second largest sell-off of tech stocks in their history last week. And while one week does not a trend make, it does stand in stark contrast with the Magnificent Seven fervor that ensnared Wall Street mere months ago. Low volumes, eventful markets: The tides appear to have shifted and the usual summer doldrums are nowhere to be found. \u201cSummer 2024 may prove volatile, with momentum stalling amid policy uncertainty,\u201d wrote Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Chief Investment Officer Lisa Shatlett in a note this week. \u201cEconomic crosscurrents have left the [Federal Reserve] more tentative regarding rate cuts, amplifying the potential significance of each data point as debate continues over the degree of policy restriction,\u201d she said. A series of weak Treasury auctions could also roil markets, not to mention the ongoing and closely contested upcoming presidential election. Market volatility in an election year tends to pick up in October, but low trading volume and large potential catalysts could mean big swings in the weeks to come. We\u2019ve already seen whiplash-inducing moves in the Dow over the past two weeks as traders reacted to unexpected economic data. A shrinking market: The stock market isn\u2019t the economy (for the most part). And its influence over the macro environment has been fading for some time. At their peak in 1996, there were 7,300 publicly traded companies in the US. Today there are about 4,300. Nearly 90% of all firms with revenues greater than $100 million are now private, said Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. Privately-owned firms also account for nearly 80% of all US jobs openings. \u201cBottom line: Public markets are a small part of the overall economy,\u201d he said. Putting it together: A shrinking market and retreating investors indicate that the appetite for risk in the US is quickly fading. Fear is currently driving the US market, according to CNN\u2019s Fear and Greed Index. Years of elevated interest and inflation rates, a chaotic political and geopolitical environment and general economic uncertainty may be sending both executives and shareholders into retreat. What it means: That\u2019s worrisome, according to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. \u201cThe total [of public companies] should have grown dramatically, not shrunk,\u201d wrote Dimon in his annual shareholder letter earlier this spring. The number of private companies in the US backed by private equity firms, meanwhile, has grown from 1,900 to 11,200 over the last two decades, according to JPMorgan data. Dimon\u2019s company, of course, makes a huge amount of money from taking companies public, so he\u2019s not exactly an impartial observer. But Dimon said his concerns are broader than JPMorgan\u2019s bottom line: If this trend continues, our understanding of the US economy could become hazier, he argued. \u201cThis trend is serious,\u201d warned Dimon on Monday. \u201cWe really need to consider: Is this the outcome we want?\u201d CEOs are making almost 200 times what workers are CEOs raked in fat pay packages last year as the US stock market boomed, reports my colleague Matt Egan. Bosses have always made more money than workers. But the gap between CEOs and employees is growing. The median CEO in the S&P 500\u00a0was paid 196 times\u00a0as much as the median employee in 2023, according to an analysis by Equilar and The Associated Press. That\u2019s up from a ratio of 185 in 2022. The widening divide is driven by the fact that CEO pay \u2014 which is closely tied to share prices \u2014 is rising notably faster than that of employees. Many workers, in fact, are struggling to keep up with the cost of living. The jump in 2023 alone was significant. Median total compensation for S&P 500 CEOs (including stock awards) soared to $16.3 million in 2023 \u2014 a huge year-over-year increase of 12.6%, compared to just 0.9% in 2022. Workers made more money, too. But at a much slower pace. The median S&P 500 employee earned $81,467 last year, up 5.2% from 2022, the report said. To put it another way: The annual pay hike amounted to about $4,300 for workers. For CEOs, it was an extra $1.5 million. Job openings fall to new 3-year low, as the\u00a0US economy\u00a0continues to slow The number of job openings in the US shrank for the second month in a row, setting a new three-year low amid\u00a0further signals of cooling in the labor market, reports my colleague Alicia Wallace.  There were 8.06 million available jobs posted in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report released Tuesday. That\u2019s below the downwardly revised 8.36 million seen a month before and the lowest since February 2021. Economists were expecting job openings to register 8.36 million, according to FactSet estimates. As of April, there were an estimated 1.2 available jobs for every job seeker. That\u2019s the lowest ratio since June 2021, BLS data shows. A slowing of job growth could put the labor market on closer footing to pre-pandemic levels, but it also could mean a slowing in the broader economy. The Federal Reserve, in its battle against high inflation, is wanting to see demand soften and price hikes slow even further\u00a0before cutting rates.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}

At issue is the publication of an article that said Palestinians are living under a \u201cbrutally sophisticated structure of oppression\u201d by Israel. The board of directors for the Columbia Law Review said in a statement obtained by CNN that the website has been \u201ctemporarily suspended\u201d because the \u201cpiece had not been subject to the usual processes of review or selection for article.\u201d The website has been offline since Monday, with a message that it\u2019s \u201cunder maintenance\u201d when visited as of Wednesday morning. The New York Times was first to report the outage and the board\u2019s statement. The Columbia Law Review Association is an independent nonprofit organization with its own board of directors, and it is not governed by Columbia University or its law school. The board said it asked the student editors on Sunday to open up the review of the article so \u201call student editors would have an opportunity to read the piece, raise any questions or concerns, and otherwise engage.\u201d \u201cWe thought that was necessary in fairness to student editors who had not been part of the group working on the piece and were not previously aware of the piece\u2019s content or even its existence. Whatever your views of this piece, it will clearly be controversial and potentially have an impact on all associated with the Review,\u201d the statement said. The piece was published Monday, despite the board saying it had asked for a delay in publishing until June 7 pending more review. \u201cWe also would like to get the website back up as soon as possible, as having it down is now preventing access to the Review\u2019s scholarship,\u201d it said. The article that sparked the controversy was written by Rabea Eghbariah, a doctoral candidate at Harvard University. He argues that a new legal concept called Nakba is needed to describe more accurately the current condition of Palestinians. It derives from \u201cal-Nakba,\u201d which Palestinians have used to refer to the 1948 establishment of Israel, and means \u201ccatastrophe\u201d in Arabic. \u201cThe attempt to silence my legal scholarship on the Nakba by shutting down the entire Columbia Law Review website is not only reflective of a pervasive and anti-intellectual Palestine exception to academic freedom but is also a testament to a culture of Nakba denialism,\u201d Eghbariah said in a statement to CNN. Roughly 700,000 Palestinians\u00a0fled or were expelled from their homes\u00a0by armed Jewish groups seeking to establish the state of Israel during Al Nakba. More than 15,000 Palestinians\u00a0were also killed\u00a0and 531 towns and villages destroyed during al-Nakba, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, an institute of the Palestinian Authority. \u201cThe intervention by the CLR Board of Directors exposes, once again, that US academic institutions are, in fact, a very hostile environment for Palestinian voices and thought. What is so scary about Palestinians speaking their truth?\u201d It\u2019s the latest flashpoint for Columbia University that has grappled with demonstrations from pro-Palestinian protesters who put up encampments on the school\u2019s grounds protesting Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. On Tuesday, it settled a lawsuit from a Jewish student that said the school failed provide a safe environment.

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}

Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can \u201clisten\u201d to people\u2019s questions and converse in real time. \u201cShellie\u201d can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while \u201cArif\u201d is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_business_american-consumer-economic-engine", "text": "It\u2019s becoming tougher and tougher for Americans to carry on with their spending spree. Years of elevated inflation and the highest interest rates in almost a quarter century are wearing out the US consumer. Savings accumulated during the Covid-19 pandemic are drying up, borrowers continue to rack up debt and delinquencies are marching higher. Retailers say shoppers are fed up with rising prices and are changing their purchasing behavior. Americans power economic growth with their spending, and they\u2019re being buffeted from every direction. US consumers unleashed a tsunami of demand when the economy ascended from pandemic depths. That momentum persisted last year as Americans gladly opened their wallets, selling out high-profile concerts and breaking travel records, which also staved off a widely anticipated recession. Such exuberance is being kept alive by America\u2019s solid job market, with sub-4% unemployment, nearly two million job openings more than unemployed people seeking work and wages that are outpacing inflation. The job market is proving to be the US economy\u2019s saving grace, but it is unmistakable that Americans are feeling pinched. Once that shoe drops, it could cause an earthquake for the world\u2019s biggest economy. \u201cAs long as people stay employed, they\u2019ll continue to spend because it\u2019s hard to pull back dramatically without feeling like you\u2019re shortchanging yourself,\u201d Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office, told CNN. \u201cBut consumers are being very selective now, and they will cut back if they have to.\u201d A slowdown according to economic data Given the barrage of economic hurdles facing consumers, economists are paying close attention for a turning point. Sales at US retailers and restaurants were unexpectedly flat in April, missing the 0.4% gain economists projected. Retail spending, which is adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation, was also revised down for March. A second estimate of gross domestic product, released Thursday, showed that consumer spending was weaker in the first three months of the year than initially reported. Consumption, which accounts for about two-thirds of the US economy, advanced 2% in the first quarter, down from the 2.5% reflected in the first estimate. That resulted in gross domestic product overall to be revised down to a 1.3% annualized rate, compared to the 1.6% initially estimated. Economists polled by FactSet are expecting data to be released Friday to show that consumer spending slowed notably in April from March. But perhaps the most unsettling economic release that came in below economists\u2019 expectations was the employment report for April. Employers added just 175,000 jobs last month, a big miss from the 235,000 jobs economists projected in a FactSet poll. And instead of holding steady at 3.8%, as expected, the unemployment rate edged higher to 3.9%. The job market is humming along just fine for now, but for how much longer remains to be seen. It\u2019s unclear if the recent slate of disappointing figures means the economy will weaken further or rebound because one month\u2019s data \u2014 not even one quarter\u2019s \u2014 does not make a trend. Warnings from retailers Retail earnings have painted a mixed picture, but lower and middle-income customers are now pulling back. Walmart (WMT) saw customers across income brackets shop more frequently at the chain across the first three months of the year, including higher-income consumers buying groceries in a sign that consumers are squeezed. Other chains have seen similar signals. Lower-income consumers bought more private-label brands and $1 items at Dollar General during its latest quarter, that company said. Kohl\u2019s (KSS) stock plunged more than 20% Thursday after weak quarterly results, showing how middle-income customers have pulled back on non-essential clothing and discretionary merchandise at department stores. \u201cOur customers continue to be pressured by a number of economic factors, including high interest rates and inflation,\u201d Kohl\u2019s CEO Thomas Kingsbury said on a call with analysts on Thursday. \u201cOur middle income customer continues to be impacted.\u201d Target, Home Depot and Best Buy, which have been some of the strongest retailers in recent years, have taken a hit from the pullback in discretionary goods. Many retailers have slashed prices and ramped up discounts to try to boost demand.Still, there have been bright spots in the retail industry. TJX, the parent of TJ Maxx and Home Goods, has surged as consumers seek out bargains. And Abercrombie & Fitch, a 1990s mainstay, has tapped into consumer nostalgia to revitalize the brand. Economists were humbled last year when their bets that the economy would fall into a recession proved to be flat-out wrong, so the economy\u2019s resilience ought not to be underestimated. But the latest data and earnings results show that the economic landscape remains undeniably tough and it is putting Americans to the test.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/business/american-consumer-economic-engine/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_tech_palestinian-american-sues-meta-instagram", "text": "A Palestinian-American engineer has sued the social media giant Meta, accusing his former employer of discriminating against pro-Palestinian speech on its platforms and of wrongfully firing him after he investigated the issue as part of his official duties. The lawsuit by Ferras Hamad \u2014 a Meta engineer assigned to review Instagram content filters related to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine \u2014 claims Meta fired him because of his Palestinian background and for raising concerns about the company\u2019s handling of a prominent Palestinian war photographer\u2019s Instagram account. The lawsuit highlights how divisions over the conflict in Gaza have not only played out on social media but also, according to Hamad, within the companies that operate those same online platforms. \u201cThe employee was dismissed for violating Meta\u2019s data access policies, which we make clear to employees will result in immediate termination,\u201d Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement to CNN. According to the complaint filed Tuesday in California state court in Santa Clara County, the photographer\u2019s account, with more than 17 million followers, had been incorrectly labeled as pornographic. When Hamad flagged the matter late last year to colleagues within the same team, he allegedly began to receive communications from Meta employees outside of the team pressuring him to drop the investigation. While trying to understand the photographer\u2019s case, Hamad claims he \u201cfollowed the guidance provided for debugging such issues, including checking the publicly accessible posts of the user.\u201d Weeks later, following an employment investigation, Hamad was abruptly fired, the lawsuit said, with Meta allegedly claiming that Hamad had violated the company\u2019s user-data access policies despite both his manager and Meta\u2019s security team affirming that no policy violations had occurred. The firing took place against the backdrop of other examples of company bias against pro-Palestinian speech, Hamad alleges. Those examples include situations where Meta allegedly deleted employees\u2019 internal posts mentioning deaths of relatives in Gaza; mentions of Palestinian refugees from an internal group dedicated to refugee support; and an internal letter from employees to Meta executives flagging concerns about Meta\u2019s moderation of content related to Palestinians, Muslims and Arabs, according to the complaint. The lawsuit also cites a December 2023 report by Human Rights Watch\u00a0documenting claims that Meta\u00a0unreasonably suppressed peaceful\u00a0pro-Palestinian speech. Hamad \u201cwas scrutinized, interrogated, and terminated because he was of Palestinian national origin and/or Muslim investigating a SEV [severe issue] related to one of the most famous Palestinian photojournalists during the conflict in Gaza,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. As part of the suit, Hamad is accusing Meta of illegal discrimination, harassment, retaliation and wrongful termination, requesting a jury trial to determine damages he has suffered including lost income and benefits as well as lost career opportunities and undue stress.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/tech/palestinian-american-sues-meta-instagram/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_business_zero-down-mortgage-nightcap", "text": "America\u2019s gummed-up housing market is a $45 trillion mess \u2014 a big old knot of economic forces smashing into a century\u2019s worth of cultural conditioning about the value of homeownership. There are some obvious, urgent needs: We need more housing, full stop. And that housing needs to be affordable. And we should probably stop letting Wall Street firms become landlords for the sole purpose of extracting capital from renters who could otherwise build equity. Point is, policymakers aren\u2019t running out of puzzles to solve when it comes to housing. Perhaps the last thing the market needs is another shady financial product that pushes low-income Americans into homes they can\u2019t afford, under terms that could bankrupt them. And yet, here we are. The zero-down mortgage is making a comeback, my colleague Matt Egan reports. Two weeks ago, one of the nation\u2019s largest mortgage lenders rolled out a \u201cnew\u201d program (I put new in quotation marks because, well, we\u2019ve seen this movie before) that allow first-time homebuyers to secure their purchase with no money down. Zero down. Lots on the line Let\u2019s briefly get into how it works, and then we can talk about why it\u2019s a huge red flag for anyone with passing understanding of the 2008 financial crisis. So, you want to buy a home but you\u2019re not sitting on enough savings for a downpayment. (Super common, totally fine, we\u2019ve all been there.) Under the deal being peddled by United Wholesale Mortgage, you can bypass that initial cash payment. (Sounds great, right? Read on.) Instead, you borrow 3% of the home\u2019s value (up to $15,000) as an interest-free loan, and pay for 97% of the home\u2019s value with a standard mortgage. (Interest-free! Where do I sign up?) Here\u2019s the catch: That $15,000 won\u2019t accrue interest, but it will need to be paid back \u2014 in full, all at once \u2014 when you either sell the home, pay off the mortgage or refinance. That will work out great, assuming nothing bad happens to you or the economy and the value of your home keeps going up. And honestly, when has the value of the housing market ever gone anywhere but up up up up? Ohhhh right.  So let\u2019s just highlight some of the ways this $15,000 sword of Damocles could wind up stabbing you in the back. UWM is pushing back on all those concerns, noting that borrowers must still go through strict underwriting guidelines, and lending standards have gone up significantly since the financial crisis. \u201cPeople who make these claims are uneducated about the current state of the industry,\u201d Alex Elezaj, UWM\u2019s chief strategy officer, told CNN. \u201cIn today\u2019s environment, UWM is responsible for underwriting the loan, which gives us confidence that these are high quality loans.\u201d And sure, we\u2019re not exactly doling out NINJA loans \u2014 no income, no job or assets \u2014 anymore. But if there\u2019s a morsel of wisdom mortgage companies should have tattooed on their foreheads it\u2019s that lower-income people with no savings are likely to suffer more in a bad economy. \u201cOne of the lessons of the subprime crisis,\u201d said Jonathan Adams, an assistant professor at Saint Joseph\u2019s University, \u201cwas that you are\u00a0not\u00a0doing any favors to borrowers by making it too easy to borrow.\u201d Creative homebuying The resurgence of the zero-down loan underscores how sticky the housing market of 2024 has become. With low inventory and mortgage rates around 7%, sellers are unmotivated to move, and buyers lack choice, forcing some to get creative. One way for motivated buyers to hunt for a lower mortgage rate is buy someone else\u2019s. \u201cAssumable\u201d mortgages are loans that allow a homebuyer to take over a seller\u2019s existing loan \u2014 its (ideally) lower interest rate, my colleague Samantha Delouya reports. The way it works: A buyer pays out in cash the amount that the seller has in equity, while taking on the remaining mortgage balance. It\u2019s not a perfect solution for everyone, of course \u2014 that equity could be a hefty amount that the buyer may not have on hand, and only about a quarter of all mortgages is the US are assumable. But it beats waiting on the magic combination of macroeconomic forces to finally bring rates on new mortgages down. It worked for Ellen Harper, a software analyst in her mid-50s, who closed on a Fairburn, Georgia, home in April, when the average 30-year rate was just over 7%. Harper\u2019s rate? 2.49%. That\u2019s saving her thousands of dollars in monthly payments, Samantha writes. \u201cI just decided I wanted to see how low I could pay on the interest rate,\u201d Harper says. \u201cI went into it looking for the best deal I could get, and I think I did pretty good.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/business/zero-down-mortgage-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_05_business_tj-maxx-body-cameras-shoplifting", "text": "Hourly retail security workers are now wearing police-like body cameras at major stores. Retail giant TJX, the parent of TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, said it\u2019s equipping some store employees with body cameras to thwart shoplifting and keep customers and employees safe. TJX finance chief John Klinger disclosed the body-camera initiative on an earnings call last month. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a de-escalation, where people are less likely to do something when they\u2019re being videotaped,\u201d he said. TJX isn\u2019t alone. In a survey of major chains by the National Retail Federation last year, 35% of US retailers said they were researching body cameras for employees. The manufacturer of Taser devices and other security companies are now designing and marketing body cameras specifically for retail workers. Although retailers say they\u2019re looking to cut down on costly merchandise loss and keep stores safe, outfitting workers with body cameras may do little to stop shoplifting, some criminologists say. Worker advocates say improved training, better staffing levels in stores and other safety investments will go further to protect frontline workers and reduce shoplifting. One TJ Maxx retail worker in Florida said the body cameras were \u201cjust for show\u201d and their presence did not make employees feel any safer. The job of these security workers \u201cwas to just stand there with the tactical vest labeled \u2018security,\u2019 and the camera mounted on the vest,\u201d said the employee, who spoke under the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters.  \u201cIt feels like the implementation of this program with the cameras isn\u2019t meant to achieve anything, but rather just something the company can point to\u201d to say it is improving security. Loss prevention workers Over the past year, TJX has assigned its hourly unarmed security workers, known as loss prevention associates, to wear body cameras in certain stores. The TJX workers who wear the cameras undergo \u201cthorough training on how to use the cameras effectively in their roles,\u201d a TJX spokesperson said. The company only shares video footage upon law enforcement request or in response to a subpoena. \u201cBody cameras are just one of the many ways that we work to support a safe store environment,\u201d the spokesperson said. The company did not provide additional details on training or share policy on when the cameras are turned on. TJX is one of the only retailers speaking publicly about body cameras and posting job openings with specific details of the cameras in the job description. The primary responsibilities of one job at a Marshalls in Miami Beach, Florida, are to maintain a \u201cproper and professional stance\u201d at the front of the store, act as a \u201cvisual deterrent to prevent potential loss/dishonesty\u201d and wear a company-issued body camera. The description says that the camera is to record \u201cspecific events involving critical incidents for legal, safety, and training purposes.\u201d These employees, who wear a company-approved black vest, black pants and black shoes, are instructed not to stop or chase after shoplifting suspects. Growing trend The retail industry is responding to theft in stores and violence against workers. Many retailers report they have seen an uptick in organized theft, which typically involves groups of thieves who steal items at stores. About 90% of asset protection specialists surveyed last year by the National Retail Federation said the crime had become more of a risk over the prior three years and that shoplifters have become more violent. Precise national data on organized retail crime is lacking, however, and some analysts say the threat of shoplifting to retailers is overblown. Body cameras are just the latest in a slew of security measures retailers have taken, such as locking up products behind glass cases and removing self-checkout stations. Retailers are also working more closely with law enforcement and devoting more internal resources to investigating theft. In the UK, Tesco, Lidl and other grocers have issued body cameras to employees. Bakery chain Greggs gave employees body cameras after a rise in sausage roll thefts and threats from customers. Axon Enterprise, which owns Taser and primarily develops technology and products for police, launched a \u201cBody Workforce\u201d camera this year for retail and health care workers. These cameras are lighter than ones Axon develops for police offers because they don\u2019t record for as long and require as much a battery life, Axon President Joshua Isner said at an analyst conference last month. They are also a more \u201cinviting product, instead of more of like a militaristic\u201d camera worn by police, he said. \u201cWe think retail is an emerging market for body cameras,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think this is a logical extension of where our business is headed.\u201d The company told CNN that dozens of retailers are piloting Axon\u2019s body cameras, including big-box chains and specialty retailers. Axon did not share specific chains. One trial retailer saw a 53% reduction in incidents with the cameras compared to stores where employees were not wearing them, the company said. Series of concerns Over the past decade, police departments have equipped officers with body cameras to improve public accountability. John Eck, a criminologist at the University of Cincinnati, said body cameras in retail \u201ccan help sort things out\u201d when there are customer complaints over issues like racial profiling in stores or wrongful arrests for shoplifting. Despite TJX and Axon\u2019s claims, some criminologists say that body cameras are unlikely to be an added deterrent to shoplifters who already know that there are cameras throughout stores. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much this will stop someone in the act. They\u2019re already going in with the assumption they will be recorded,\u201d said Ernesto Lopez, a research specialist who has studied shoplifting trends at the Council on Criminal Justice. Body cameras could help retailers or law enforcement identify shoplifters, but that would require employees wearing them to get close to a suspect, potentially putting their safety at risk. \u201cI would be really cautious about putting underpaid, undertrained people in these positions,\u201d said Thaddeus Johnson, a senior research fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice. \u201cWe have to be really careful when we talk about body-worn cameras.\u201d Stuart Appelbaum, the president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, said, \u201cit\u2019s not enough to just slap a camera on somebody and say it\u2019s an alternative to doing more significant safety measures.\u201d The union, which does not represent TJX stores, has advocated for legislation advancing in New York that will require retail employers to adopt a violence prevention plan and train workers in de-escalation and active shooters. Large employers must install panic buttons throughout stores under the legislation. Appelbaum also expressed concerns about the information the body cameras are collecting and whether it could be used to stymie union organizing attempts. \u201cEmployees feel like they are under surveillance,\u201d he said. -CNN\u2019s Curt Devine contributed to this article.

{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_media_pro-trump-epoch-times-money-laundering-charge", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. One of\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0biggest media boosters is in serious legal jeopardy. In an\u00a0astonishing indictment\u00a0made public this week, the\u00a0Department of Justice\u00a0accused\u00a0The Epoch Times\u00a0of having \u201cbenefited\u201d from a multinational $67 million money laundering scheme staged by its chief financial officer,\u00a0Weidong Guan. Guan, according to the indictment, led efforts at the conspiratorial right-wing media outlet to \u201cknowingly purchase tens of millions of dollars in crime proceeds\u201d and then move the money into bank accounts belonging to The Epoch Times. Guan and his unnamed alleged co-conspirators at the company moved the money via \u201ctens of thousands of layered transactions\u201d that exploited stolen identities and prepaid debit cards, the Justice Department explained. The sophisticated scheme boosted revenue flowing into the coffers of The Epoch Times, the Justice Department said. In one year, revenue at the Trump-boosting outlet ballooned 410%, jumping from $15 million to about $62 million, the Justice Department added. While The Epoch Times receives little media attention in comparison to other pro-Trump outlets, such as\u00a0Fox News, its reach and support for the disgraced former president and his MAGA movement cannot be overstated.\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0referred to it\u00a0as \u201cone of the country\u2019s most powerful digital publishers\u201d and\u00a0The Atlantic\u00a0flatly called it\u00a0a \u201cpro-Trump propaganda machine.\u201d For years, the fledgling nonprofit publication was merely a niche, hardcopy newspaper that advanced the\u00a0Falun Gong, a religious movement banned in China. But shortly after the 2016 election, it underwent a significant digital transformation, which was fueled by a firehose of traffic from\u00a0Facebook. The outlet also purchased millions of dollars in advertisements on the\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg-owned platform, catapulting The Epoch Times from merely being handed out on city street corners into the feeds of millions of Americans from coast to coast. The outlet blanketed Facebook with algorithmically supercharged pro-Trump and conspiratorial content, often sending its stories viral and rocketing to the top of publishing charts, surpassing more established legacy news operations. Ultimately, Facebook banned the outlet from purchasing advertisements in 2019 after\u00a0NBC News\u00a0reported on\u00a0its \u201ceffort to obfuscate its connection to some $2 million worth of ads that promoted [Trump] and conspiracy theories about his political enemies.\u201d On its website, The Epoch Times claims to be \u201cgrounded in ethical journalism\u201d and employ reporters \u201cguided by the highest code of conduct and ethics in their reporting\u201d \u2014 a narrative punctured by the Justice Department\u2019s indictment. In a short statement, which notably was delivered into my inbox from an unnamed spokesperson via a generic \u201cmedia inquires\u201d email address, The Epoch Times said it will cooperate with federal authorities. The company added that Guan is \u201cinnocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d but that it had \u201csuspended him until this matter is resolved.\u201d Suffice to say, that statement does not answer much. For one, the indictment from the Justice Department indicated that an entire \u201cMake Money Online\u201d team at The Epoch Times \u2014\u00a0not just Guan\u00a0\u2014 was involved in the alleged conspiracy. And it strongly suggested that senior leaders at the organization should have been aware of the wrongdoing, given that a number of people and institutions had contacted The Epoch Times about the suspicious activity. But, when CNN asked for further comment on Tuesday, The Epoch Times brass chose to stay mum.\u00a0John Tang, the chief executive, and\u00a0Jasper Fakkert, the editor-in-chief, did not respond to multiple emails seeking basic information. Have any of the outlet\u2019s assets been frozen as part of the probe? The indictment said there was an entire group at The Epoch Times that took part in the alleged money laundering scheme. Have they also been suspended? Notably, Tang and Fakkert declined to answer questions about whether they were aware of the alleged scheme. But if they were not, are they conducting their own probe into the matter? They won\u2019t say. It\u2019s also unclear how companies that do business with The Epoch Times will respond.\u00a0Outfront Media, which sells billboard space across the country, did not respond to inquires about whether it will continue its relationship with the embattled outlet. And\u00a0PayPal, which facilitates online donations to the organization, declined to comment. When asked on Tuesday whether further charges could be brought in the case given the sprawling nature of the alleged scheme, a Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. But one wonders whether other leaders at the organization \u2014\u00a0or the non-profit itself\u00a0\u2014 could soon face legal trouble.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/media/pro-trump-epoch-times-money-laundering-charge/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_business_china-drone-jammers-russian-buyers-intl-hnk", "text": "A Chinese government agency established to promote trade with Russia has been trying to source drone detectors and jammers, adding to concerns that Beijing may be supplying dual-use technology to Moscow. Foreign companies were seeking \u201cunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipment,\u201d including drone detectors and jammers, according to a procurement notice posted on May 22 on the official WeChat account of the Guangdong Provincial Association for Promotion of Trade with Russia. The association, overseen by the province\u2019s Commerce Department, said buyers wanted \u201cinterference generators, drone detectors (trade names BorisTone, Assel Labs and Bulat) or other similar technology solutions, drone suppressors, and communication band jammers.\u201d Bulat drone detectors were developed by 3MX, a Russian company. They are known for being used by the Russian army during its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The procurement document has been removed from the association\u2019s WeChat social media account, but it still exists on the account of another government body in the same province. The Yunfu City\u2019s Association for the Promotion of International Trade posted the same notice on WeChat last week, asking any \u201cinterested company\u201d with the products to submit their information. Drone jammers emit signals at frequencies that drones use to operate and transmit information, overwhelming their ability to communicate. Ukraine has relied heavily on drones since the beginning of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion\u00a0and has piled resources into advancing technology and domestic manufacturing. It has been using them to target Russia\u2019s oil and gas industry, still the biggest source of cash for Moscow\u2019s war effort despite Western sanctions. The posting of the Chinese notices comes as Beijing faces significant pressure from Western governments to ensure that dual-use products with military applications are not finding their way to Russia\u2019s defense sector or its forces on Ukraine\u2019s battlefield. The United States has accused Beijing of covertly supporting Moscow\u2019s war by selling such dual-use goods. They include things like semiconductor chips, navigation equipment and jet parts. Beijing says it is neutral in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and has repeatedly said that it does not provide weapons to either side and \u201cstrictly controls\u201d the export of dual-use items. Notice removed A person who answered the phone\u00a0at the Guangdong association denied that the document was intended to secure orders for Russian customers. He told CNN\u00a0that it was removed because it was \u201cimproper.\u201d\u00a0When asked for further detail, he said that the request was made on behalf of buyers in Kazakhstan, before abruptly ending the call. CNN has also reached out to the Yunfu trade association for comment. According to its official WeChat account, the Guangdong association\u2019s main responsibilities include supporting the province\u2019s global trade work, connecting with Russian buyers or sellers, organizing exchanges, coordinating trade settlement with Russia and providing Russia-related legal consultation for Chinese traders.  China has forged deeper ties with Russia since its invasion of Ukraine and become a vital economic and diplomatic lifeline for the country. Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Beijing and met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, both men praising the close relations between their countries. Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr\u00a0Zelensky said at a\u00a0meeting of defense chiefs in Singapore that China\u2019s support to Russia would extend the\u00a0war in Ukraine, adding Ukraine\u2019s voice to concerns raised by the US and European leaders in recent months. \u201cBeijing does provide a lot of different ways of direct support to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, whether it is either the purchase of oil to help fuel its economy or helping them reconstitute the defense industrial base,\u201d said Oriana Skylar Mastro, a fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. Mastro said she is \u201cnot particularly surprised\u201d that local Chinese governments would help Russian companies seek drone equipment. But, she doesn\u2019t believe Beijing will have more \u201cdirect\u201d involvement in the war. Last week, the US warned it could act against Chinese firms and financial institutions in response to Beijing\u2019s alleged backing of Russian war efforts.

Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_business_sunak-starmer-debate-uk-election", "text": "The UK Treasury has flatly contradicted Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s claim that its impartial officials had calculated that the opposition Labour Party would \u201cput up everyone\u2019s taxes by \u00a32,000.\u201d Sunak made the claim during a televised debate Tuesday ahead of July\u2019s election, as he and Labour leader Keir Starmer clashed on issues ranging from the cost-of-living and immigration, to the state of the National Health Service. \u201cIndependent Treasury officials have costed Labour\u2019s policies and they amount to a \u00a32,000 tax rise for every working family,\u201d Sunak said. The Conservative Party leader later repeated the claim. On the eve of the debate, James Bowler, the most senior civil servant in the Treasury, said officials in his department had not been involved in producing that number. In a letter dated June 3, a copy of which was posted to X by senior Labour Party official Darren Jones, Bowler wrote that \u201ccivil servants were not involved in the production or presentation of the Conservative Party\u2019s document \u2018Labour\u2019s Tax Rises\u2019 or in the calculation of the total figure used.\u201d The Conservative Party document claims that Labour would have to find \u00a338.5 billion ($49.2 billion) to meet all of its spending commitments, either borrowing the money or raising taxes by \u201c\u00a32,094 per working household over the next four years.\u201d The document states that \u201calmost every costing contained here has been conducted by (the) Treasury.\u201d In his letter to Labour, Bowler said he had cautioned senior Conservative Party officials and advisers against suggesting that the \u00a338.5 billion figure was based on Treasury analysis. He said that \u201cany costings derived from other sources or produced by other organisations should not be presented as having been produced by the Civil Service,\u201d adding that he had \u201creminded Ministers and advisers that this should be the case.\u201d Sunak narrowly won the debate Tuesday, according to an opinion poll. A YouGov snap poll of 1,657 viewers showed 51% thought he performed better, compared to 49% for Starmer. But Bowler\u2019s letter could undermine Sunak\u2019s claim to lead with integrity \u2014 a pledge made when he became prime minister in October 2022 \u2014 as he battles a high-stakes election. Opinion\u00a0polls suggest the Conservatives are set to be booted from office, with Labour on course to win a UK election for the first time since 2005. In a statement Wednesday, Labour said Sunak had \u201clied eleven times to the British people\u201d about the party\u2019s tax plans. \u201cLabour will not raise taxes on working people. It\u2019s the Tories who have made \u00a371 billion of unfunded promises that will mean higher taxes and higher borrowing,\u201d the party wrote in an emailed campaign message. During the debate Tuesday, Starmer dismissed the \u00a32,000 ($2,560) figure as \u201cnonsense\u201d and said it was based on \u201cpretend\u201d Labour policies. A Conservative Party spokesperson said that its document on Labour\u2019s tax plans \u201cused clear Labour policies, their own costings or official (Treasury) costings using the lowest assumptions.\u201d In a statement shared with CNN, the spokesperson added: \u201cIt is now for Labour to explain which of the policies which were Labour policy no longer are Labour policy.\u201d \u2014 Luke McGee contributed reporting.

{"id": "2024_06_04_economy_general-election-issue-uk-economy", "text": "When UK voters elect a new government on July 4, the health of the world\u2019s sixth-biggest economy will likely be the main factor in deciding the outcome. The Conservative Party of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has been in office since 2010, a period that has included the twin shocks of a pandemic and war in Ukraine. But the United Kingdom has also been held back by two self-inflicted wounds \u2014 deep austerity in the wake of the global financial crisis and the 2016 decision to quit the European Union, which raised new barriers to trade. Economic growth has been anemic in recent years, squeezing living standards and starving public services of funds. In their first televised debate Tuesday, Sunak and Keir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, clashed over Britain\u2019s economic fortunes, taxes, immigration and the state of the National Health Service \u2014 key issues for voters, according to polling by YouGov. The stakes are high: opinion polls suggest the Conservatives are set to be booted from office, with Labour on course to win a UK election for the first time since Tony Blair took the party to victory in 2005.  Sunak pointed to rising wages and a strengthening economy as proof that his plan to \u201crestore economic stability\u201d is working. Starmer, meanwhile, attacked the Conservative Party for presiding over 14 years of economic decline. Several audience members highlighted that many households are still experiencing a cost-of-living crisis and are struggling to pay their bills. When they cast their ballots, voters will consider whether their lives have materially improved since 2010, when the Conservatives came to power. Here\u2019s what data shows has happened to wages, living standards, the value of the pound, house prices and waiting times for medical treatment on the NHS. Incomes have barely risen Inflation, which hit a record 11.1% just 18 months ago, has eaten into households\u2019 spending power. Although the annual pace of price rises has slowed \u2014 and wages have now grown faster than inflation for nine months in a row \u2014 real, or inflation-adjusted, pay has barely increased since 2010, which means people aren\u2019t substantially better-off. \u201cPoor income growth has been an unfortunate feature of economic life in the UK over the last 15 years. And it has been slow growth for essentially everyone: rich and poor, old and young,\u201d Tom Waters, an associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an economics research institute, said in a statement Friday. \u201cIn the long run, what is needed is rises in productivity,\u201d he added. The Resolution Foundation makes the same diagnosis. The think tank has estimated that real average weekly earnings last year were \u00a3205 ($262) below the level they would have been had they carried on growing at the same pace as before the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cWeak productivity growth has delivered an unprecedented stagnation in real wages, even before the highest inflation in four decades hit,\u201d it said in a report published in December. Living standards have disappointed Feeble growth in productivity \u2014 often measured as gross domestic product per hour worked \u2014 has hamstrung many advanced economies since at least the global financial crisis. But the United Kingdom has fared worse than many peers, resulting in a bigger hit to incomes and also hurting living standards. \u201cThe period between 2010 and 2024 has been economically remarkable,\u201d Nick Ridpath, research economist at the IFS, said in a statement Monday, citing slow earnings growth and steep public spending cuts, among other things. \u201cAt the heart of it all was a period of abysmal growth in productivity and, with it, living standards.\u201d According to the IFS, in the 12 years before 2007, the average income of Britain\u2019s working age population rose more than 40% \u2014 more than three times the growth in the United States and seven times that in Germany. By contrast, between 2007 and 2019, the typical UK income increased just 6% \u2014 half the level of the United States and almost three times less than in Germany. The pound is 14% weaker The UK currency has also taken a beating over the past 14 years \u2014 not helped by the Brexit referendum in June 2016 or the disastrous \u201cmini\u201d budget unveiled by former Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss in September 2022. Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union has haunted the pound and inward investment into the country for almost a decade. A weaker currency exacerbates inflation \u2014 which peaked at a higher level in Britain than it did in the United States and the eurozone \u2014 because it raises the cost of imported goods. \u201cBrexit led to a large and long-lasting increase in uncertainty, which analysis shows reduced investment, which will have reduced output and productivity,\u201d Clare Lombardelli, the incoming deputy governor for monetary policy at the Bank of England, said in a recent questionnaire published on the central bank\u2019s website. \u201cThe data also shows that Brexit has had a negative effect on trade, which will also weigh on productivity,\u201d she added. Home ownership is in decline While real wages have hardly grown, house prices have soared, pushing the dream of home ownership out of reach for many Brits. From a peak of \u00a3291,716 ($373,236) in September 2022 the average house price fell to \u00a3284,691 ($364,242) last December, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). But prices remain high by historic standards, particularly when compared with incomes. With affordability stretched, home ownership rates have fallen. In 2021, 62% of households in England owned their home, census data showed. That\u2019s down from 68% in 2008/2009, according to official figures, shortly before the Conservatives came to power.  Millions of Brits are stuck in rental properties, which have also become more expensive. On average, households now spend more than 29% of their after-tax income on rent, up from 24% in 2010, according to Zoopla, a property company. The NHS is overstretched One of Sunak\u2019s five promises to voters early on in his premiership was to cut NHS waiting lists. But the number of patients waiting for non-emergency treatment in England has climbed from 6.1 million in January 2023, when he made that pledge, to around 6.3 million in March this year. The treatment spans diagnostic tests and scans, procedures such as hip and knee replacements, as well as non-urgent cardiac surgery, cancer treatment and neurosurgery. Since some patients require multiple treatments, the number of outstanding appointments stood at 7.5 million in March, according to NHS England. NHS waiting lists have grown steadily since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, contributing to worker shortages in the UK. According to the ONS, ill health was the reason why more than 2.8 million people were \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d between January and March 2024. An ONS survey in February 2023 found that a third of the economically inactive were waiting for NHS treatment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/economy/general-election-issue-uk-economy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_investing_shein-ipo-london-stock-exchange", "text": "Fast fashion giant Shein, founded in China, is taking steps for going public in the United Kingdom, according to multiple media reports, in what would likely provide a shot in the arm for London\u2019s ailing main stock exchange. The online retailer is preparing to file a prospectus with the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority for approval, ahead of a potential initial public offering (IPO) that would value it at around \u00a350 billion ($64 billion), Sky News reported Sunday, citing unnamed sources in London\u2019s financial district. If Shein goes ahead with the listing, it is expected to try to raise more than \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion) from the sale of new shares, Sky News said. Bloomberg and the Financial Times have also reported that Shein is preparing a confidential filing for a London listing. A spokesperson for Shein declined to comment on the reports. The UK\u2019s Labour Party, which is widely expected to win next month\u2019s general election, said Monday that it had met with \u201ca range of companies, including Shein, that are looking to invest or list in Britain.\u201d \u201cRaising investment, productivity and (economic) growth is one of Labour\u2019s missions for government,\u201d a party spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe expect the highest regulatory standards and business practices from any company operating in the UK. We believe the best way to ensure this is to have more companies operating from and regulated by UK law,\u201d the spokesperson added. Shein, which is headquartered in Singapore, initially hoped to go public in New York, according to several media reports, but has faced political opposition in the United States over the potential implications for US national security. In an open letter to the US securities regulator in February, Republican Senator Marco Rubio urged officials to block any potential IPO by Shein in the country if it failed to make \u201cextraordinary disclosures\u201d regarding its links w\ufeffith the Chinese government. Susannah Streeter at financial services provider Hargreaves Lansdown wrote in a note Monday: \u201cWhile New York still holds immense pulling power and was the company\u2019s first choice, plans for a listing there look unlikely given the lack of a welcome by regulators.\u201d But investors in the UK are likely to have ethical concerns about Shein\u2019s business, including a lack of transparency in its supply chain and the \u201chuge volumes of cheap clothes it produces,\u201d she said. A lifeline for London? Given its high profile and potential hefty valuation, an IPO by Shein would be a much-needed coup for the London Stock Exchange. In recent years, several companies have quit the exchange for other cities or chosen New York to go public. That includes British chipmaker Arm (ARM), which notched the biggest IPO of 2023 when it listed on New York\u2019s Nasdaq in September. Fears of London\u2019s demise were fanned again in March after Wael Sawan, the CEO of Shell (SHEL), indicated in an interview with Bloomberg that the energy giant might similarly head across the pond in search of a higher stock valuation. However, Sawan then tried to stymie such speculation on a results call with analysts last month, saying that a move to Wall Street was \u201cnot a live discussion at the moment.\u201d He added that Shell was focused on buying back its shares to help juice their value. Still, even the slightest hint that Shell could ditch London will have rattled the city\u2019s financial center. The company is the second-largest constituent of London\u2019s FTSE 100 index, representing 8.2% of its market capitalization.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/investing/shein-ipo-london-stock-exchange/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}

The conference, which is widely anticipated each year as a major showcase for Apple software news, will run Monday, June 10 through Friday, June 14. Although last year\u2019s WWDC focused on the unveiling of the Vision Pro mixed reality headset, which launched in stores in February, this year is expected to turn to Apple\u2019s AI efforts.

{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_business_lululemon-is-at-a-crossroads", "text": "Lululemon, maker of the pricey yogawear sported by seemingly everyone from Pilates moms to college students to preteens in the US, is at a crossroads. For over a decade, the company has fought off competitors like Athleta and Nike to dominate the luxury athleisure market, managing to grow despite the lightning rod of controversies that followed its founder. Its soft, colorful, $98 leggings and viral beltbags have attracted an even younger demographic, a huge plus for any retailer. But, while the skin-tight look shot Lululemon to fame, it now must navigate a new, baggy pant-loving Gen Z demographic and the radical reshuffling of its own executive team. Lulu stock is down almost 40% year to date but rose more than 10% after hours on Wednesday, after slightly topping analyst revenue expectations in its first quarter 2024 earnings. Macroeconomic headwinds are hitting many peer retailers, of course. But Lulu is also coping with the addition of trendy, celebrity and influencer-backed competitors like Alo, which is known for its monochromatic, chic sets, and Vuori, which carved out a space for itself in men\u2019s athleticwear. And the company blamed its slower North American sales on its own actions: It just didn\u2019t have enough sizes and colors in stock for its youngest customers. Lulu recently announced that its chief product officer \u2013 considered by Wall Street a key engine of its success \u2013 was leaving just ahead of its first quarter earnings release Wednesday. As part of that release, Lululemon said it was raising its stock repurchase program by $1 billion, which could help calm down investors who are worried abut slowed growth. The company also maintained a brighter outlook for the year, saying it expects its net revenue to be between $10.7 billion and $10.8 billion. A departure shakes the firm Sun Choe, who had been Lululemon\u2019s creative mastermind, recently resigned to join Vans as its global brand president. The departure of the company\u2019s chief product officer adds to a \u201cwall of worry\u201d Raymond James analysts said. Choe joined Lululemon more than seven years ago and became chief product officer in 2018, according to her LinkedIn. Raymond James analysts credit Lululemon\u2019s success with strong products and marketing to Choe\u2019s role at the company. Shares fell as much as 7% on May 22 upon news of her departure. She left big shoes to fill, Wedbush analyst Tom Nikic told CNN. Under Choe, there was \u201cconstant innovation and newness, whether it\u2019s new fabrics or getting into new product categories.\u201d There\u2019s a reason Wall Street responded so negatively to Choe\u2019s departure. \u201cI think that there\u2019s a lot of people out there who believe that she was the person behind the scenes and was the most instrumental to Lululemon\u2019s success,\u201d Nikic said. Competition on both sides The fashion the company was known for has already been on the way out, Jefferies analysts warned. They \u201cbelieve the company\u2019s product assortment is falling flat.\u201d Lululemon is getting walled in by two very different types of competitors. On one end is those rapidly expanding luxury yogawear brands Alo and Vuori, who have been opening stores  near existing Lululemon locations. And then there\u2019s the culture of dupes, which claim leggings just as soft as Lulu\u2019s can be purchased for a fraction of the price. Lulu has been\u00a0\u201chyper aware\u201d of dupe culture, Nikki Neuburger, then its Chief Brand Officer, previously said in an interview with CNN Business. So much so that the brand hosted a dupe swap at the Century City Mall in Los Angeles. Bring in a knock-off pair, Lulu said, and they\u2019ll swap it out for the black Align High Rise Pant 25\u2019. That wasn\u2019t enough to quell knock-off popularity. As Americans cut back spending due to inflation and rising prices, many view a $90 pair of leggings as an unnecessary expense. And for those who can still shell out the money, Lululemon faces steep competition. Alo shot to popularity after celebrities from Hailey Bieber to Martha Stewart were photographed in the trendy brand. Vuori has a $400 million investment by Softbank and said it had bullish plans to open more than 100 stores in the US in the next five years. Time to turn it around Lululemon\u2019s demographic has shifted \u2013 originally marketed toward suburban women in their 30s and 40s, its stores are increasingly filled with younger, close to preteen-aged shoppers. In its Q4 earnings call in March, Lululemon said it had seen strong sales of its smaller sizes and colorful offerings. However, Lululemon wasn\u2019t stocked enough in these smaller sizes, which could have led these younger shoppers to competitors, Nikic said. But these are quick fixable problems, Nikic said. CEO Calvin McDonald made clear the company was still focused on pursuing\u00a0its new core customer in its last earnings call. (Lululemon has not responded to request for comment for this story in advance of their Wednesday earnings.) Lululemon also has potential for growth in its men\u2019s sector and international business. Unlike athletic brands like Nike that have a huge international footprint, Lululemon\u2019s international business represented only 21% of its business at the end of 2023. The company said in the fourth quarter that its mainland China revenue increased 78%, compared to North America\u2019s revenue increase of 9%. \u201cI certainly would not say that hope is lost with this company. This is a company that has a long track record of success,\u201d Nikic said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/business/lululemon-is-at-a-crossroads/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}

The group said in a statement it would extend a cut of 1.65 million barrels per day, announced in April 2023, until the end of 2025. That cut was due to expire at the end of this year. It is also extending a cut of 2.2 million barrels per day, announced in November, until the end of September this year, before it is \u201cgradually phased out on a monthly basis\u201d by the end of September 2025. That cut was due to expire at the end of this month, and came on top of previously agreed reductions of 3.66 million barrels per day announced in 2022 and 2023 as the group \u2014 led by Saudi Arabia and Russia \u2014 tried to counter slowing demand and rising output from the United States. The group also released its 2025 production requirements for member and nonmember countries, which were essentially the same as this year\u2019s. The United Arab Emirates\u2019 production quota increased by 300,000 barrels per day. The uptick \u201cwill be phased in gradually\u201d from January through September 2025, the group said. Sunday\u2019s decisions mean the OPEC+ group will continue to restrict supply for at least the next 18 months but gradually start drip-feeding some extra barrels back into the market later this year. Prices subdued Despite the OPEC+ cuts, in total equivalent to about 5.7% of global crude supply, and ongoing tensions in the Middle East, global oil prices have fallen by about 11% since hitting a five-month high in early April. The price of Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, ticked up 0.1% to trade at $81 a barrel by 4.30 a.m. ET on Monday. It traded at $91 in early April when a suspected Israeli airstrike on Iran\u2019s embassy in Syria sent jitters through oil markets. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, also rose 0.1% by the same time on Monday morning to trade at $77 a barrel. It is down from nearly $87 per barrel in early April. Saudi Arabia needs Brent crude to trade at around $81 a barrel in order to balance its budget, according to the International Monetary Fund. Subdued prices have partly been the result of record US oil output, which has bumped up global supply, and concerns about sluggish demand in China \u2014\u202fthe world\u2019s biggest importer of oil \u2014\u202fand other major economies. In its most recent monthly report, the International Energy Agency cut its forecast for the growth in global oil demand this year by 140,000 barrels per day to 1.1 million barrels per day, citing weak demand in developed economies, particularly in Europe. Despite the weaker growth forecast, a supply crunch could develop. The IEA expects global supply to increase by just 580,000 barrels per day this year. In March, the Paris-based agency said it expected there to be a deficit in supply in 2024 if OPEC+ extended its output cuts through the rest of the year. Sunday\u2019s OPEC+ decision coincides with Saudi Arabia selling some more shares in its oil company Aramco. The government is selling less than 1% of the Riyadh-listed company in a deal that could raise $13 billion for economic diversification projects.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/business/opec-oil-production-cuts-2025/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_business_india-economy-what-next-intl-hnk", "text": "Narendra Modi has declared victory in India\u2019s election but he\u2019ll need the support of smaller parties to govern, a shock result that could make it harder for him to pass major economic reforms. India boomed during Modi\u2019s first two terms as prime minister, leapfrogging the United Kingdom to become the world\u2019s fifth biggest economy and growing by 8.2% in the last fiscal year. But the new government will need to make more big changes to sustain that pace if India is to become an economic superpower and a manufacturing rival to China. \u201cWith a more fragmented government, we believe policy making in general is going to become more difficult going forward,\u201d said Peeyush Mittal, a portfolio manager at\u00a0Matthews Asia, a San Francisco-based investment fund. Experts have highlighted land reform as an example of policies that might now be tougher for Modi to implement. Companies face more barriers to accessing land in India than in China. It is also much harder to hire or fire workers. India will need to address those issues if it is to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington. Some of the world\u2019s biggest firms, including Apple (AAPL) supplier Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India. But while the country has emerged as a major hub for electronics manufacturing, it is still lagging behind China in sectors such as clothing, toys and furniture. Despite the surprise electoral setback for Modi\u2019s right-wing, Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party\u00a0(BJP), experts say the world\u2019s fastest growing major economy will continue to live up to its billing. \u201cThe Modi administration still has enough of a mandate to enact reforms that will keep potential growth at 6% to 7%,\u201d Shilan Shah, an economist at Capital Economics, said in a note on Tuesday. \u201cThat would leave the economy on course to more than double in size over the next decade.\u201d A shock result The BJP fell\u00a0short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on coalition partners. The party\u2019s underperformance led to a plunge on India\u2019s stock market, which had its worst day in four years Tuesday. Investors had been hoping for a strong, business-friendly government and had sent stocks to record highs Monday after weekend exit polls suggested Modi was on track for a bigger win. But analysts say that the next government will still be strong enough to ensure India becomes a global growth engine and remain an attractive destination for investors and companies. On Wednesday, stocks were up 3% The Indian economy is poised to become the world\u2019s third largest behind only the United States and China before the end of this decade. \u201cThe lack of absolute majority doesn\u2019t derail this broad economic agenda envisaged by the BJP,\u201d said Aditya Suresh,\u00a0head of India equity research at Macquarie Capital. In the long-term, he sees the government focusing on job creation, manufacturing and \u201cimproving ease of doing business.\u201d India\u2019s so-called \u201cdemographic dividend,\u201d the potential economic growth arising from a large working-age population, represents a major opportunity. Its vast consumer market and pool of affordable labor should continue to draw more attention from global brands and trading partners. Fundamentals still strong Asia\u2019s third biggest economy will also benefit from friend-shoring, a trade practice where supply chains are moved through allies, said Shah. While tensions between Beijing and the US are rising, New Delhi enjoys warm relations with Western nations. Modi\u2019s government has overseen a construction boom, spending billions building roads, railways and airports. Apart from that physical infrastructure, India has also built a range of public digital platforms, including the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), that have transformed\u00a0lives and businesses and should continue to aid with economic expansion. India is \u201cstill a strong story benefitting from democratic elections, a market-friendly government, attractive demographics, momentum out of China, and a unique digital stack, said Malcolm Dorson, head of emerging markets strategy at global investment management firm X. \u201cInvesting in India is about much more than this election. It\u2019s a 20-year story, and not one the depends on the next two weeks,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/business/india-economy-what-next-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}

India\u2019s benchmark Sensex index, which tracks 30 large companies, and the broader Nifty 50 index each ended the day at their all-time closing highs, having gained more than 3%. The surge comes after India concluded its mammoth, weeks-long election this weekend. \u201cI can say with confidence that the people of India have voted in record numbers to reelect the \u2026 government,\u201d Modi said on X on Saturday, shortly after polls closed. The 73-year-old ran on his economic record over the past 10 years, a period of robust growth for India. Results will be declared on Tuesday. In India\u2019s last election in 2019, Modi\u2019s party won 303 seats in parliament. Analysts cited multiple local exit polls that point to a much bigger Modi victory this time as the major reason for the market optimism. \u201cWith the exit polls pointing towards 370 seats mark and ahead of street expectations of 320-350 seats, markets have reacted positively,\u201d said Manish Chowdhury, head of research at brokerage\u00a0StoxBox. \u201cWe expect to see higher flows both from domestic as well as foreign investors going ahead,\u201d he added. The surge in stocks also comes after the country posted bumper economic growth numbers on Friday. The economy expanded\u00a0by more than 8% in the fiscal year that ended in March, cementing India\u2019s status as the world\u2019s fastest growing major economy. The country is comfortably placed to expand at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years, but analysts say it needs to achieve growth of\u00a08% or more\u00a0if it wants to become an economic superpower. Investors hope that if Modi wins a big majority in parliament, his government will unleash key land and labor reforms needed for the next phase of growth. Sustained expansion will push India higher up the ranks of the world\u2019s biggest economies, with some observers forecasting the country to become number three behind only the United States and China by 2027. Adani is back on top Shares in ports-to-power conglomerate Adani Group also surged on Monday. Adani Enterprises, the group\u2019s flagship firm was up over 7%, while Adani Power was up 16%. Last week, its founder Gautam Adani overtook fellow countryman Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries, to become Asia\u2019s richest man once again, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Both Ambani and Adani are considered vocal champions of Modi. Adani\u2019s rising fortunes come a year and half after his group was rocked by an unprecedented crisis when an American short-seller Hindenburg Research accused it of\u00a0engaging in fraud\u00a0over decades. Adani denounced Hindenburg\u2019s report as \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cmalicious.\u201d Since then, the tycoon has made a\u00a0remarkable comeback, with shares in some of his companies touching record highs as investors cheer his ability to adroitly bet on sectors prioritized for development by Modi. The country\u2019s stock markets have performed well during his tenure. The value of companies listed on India\u2019s exchanges surpassed $4 trillion late last year.

In the federal lawsuit filed June 2, the employees accuse the managers at the Covington plant with favoring White employees for promotions over Black workers, issuing more disciplinary actions against Black employees and a manager calling them \u201ccolored,\u201d a racist term. The lawsuit points to two White managers who \u201cformed an organization of white employees in management and human resources called the \u2018Good Ole Boys\u2019\u201d favoring White workers over their Black counterparts and going back as far as the 1980s. \u201cThe \u2018Good Ole Boys\u2019 believe that history and symbols that have been co-opted or misappropriated by the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist hate groups are useful to keep Black people \u2018in their place\u2019 and discourage Black people from speaking or taking action against the disparate treatment of Black employees at the Covington facility,\u201d according to the lawsuit.

The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}

Family Dollar has around 8,000 US stores, catering to low-income customers predominantly in cities with prices typically ranging from $1 to $10. The chain has struggled in recent years. Last year, Family Dollar announced plans to close more than 900 stores. Dollar Tree CEO Rick Dreiling said in a statement that the \u201cunique needs\u201d of the two different chains led the company to explore a split from Family Dollar. Dollar Tree typically has stores in suburban areas and focuses on middle-income consumers, unlike Family Dollar, which is located in more urban areas and caters to lower-income customers. Messy stores, high prices and over-expansion have plagued Family Dollar, analysts say. The chain has also faced steep competition from larger retailers, such as Walmart and Dollar General. And inflation in recent years has increased Family Dollar\u2019s operating costs and squeezed its lower-income customers. \u201cThe saga of Family Dollar is a long and unhappy one,\u201d Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients Wednesday. \u201cThe harsh reality is that Family Dollar is a problematic business which is a millstone around Dollar Tree\u2019s neck, dragging down overall performance.\u201d Family Dollar\u2019s sales at stores open at least one year ticked up 0.1% last quarter. Dollar Tree\u2019s (DLTR) stock fell 3% in premarket trading. Merger gone bad Family Dollar has struggled since Dollar Tree bought it in 2015\u00a0for $8.5 billion. Dollar Tree believed acquiring Family Dollar would help it compete against bigger rivals. But it misjudged the deal. The combined company hoped that by joining forces it could grow its customer base, reduce costs and fend off Dollar General, which is located primarily in rural areas. Dollar General had also bid for Family Dollar. But analysts say the match between the two different chains was a poor fit, and Dollar Tree has struggled to manage the larger Family Dollar store base. Family Dollar stores were in worse condition than Dollar Tree management expected, and early strategies to improve sales, such as selling beer, fell short. Many Family Dollar stores were located too close to each other and cannibalized each other\u2019s own sales. \u201cFamily Dollar\u2019s sales have been sputtering, hurt by neglected stores, poor product selection and unhappy workers,\u201d The Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0in 2018. Family Dollar \u201cneeds more work than the company originally thought.\u201d A year later, an activist investor pushed for a sale of the \u201cunderperforming\u201d Family Dollar business, and Family Dollar announced it would\u00a0close hundreds of stores. Even though Family Dollar has renovated thousands of stores in recent years, many are still poorly maintained, analysts say. Family Dollar was hit with a record $41.6 million fine by the Justice Department this year for violating product safety standards after selling items that were stocked in a rat-infested warehouse in West Memphis filled with live, dead and decaying rodents.

Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_business_janet-yellen-artificial-intelligence", "text": "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is expected to warn bankers and tech executives on Thursday that while artificial intelligence could open the door to vast rewards for the financial system, the technology also threatens to introduce new dangers, according to speech excerpts shared first with CNN. Yellen\u2019s speech at a\u00a0conference on financial stability\u00a0represents her most extensive remarks to date on AI. It comes as investors\u00a0scramble to get a piece of the AI boom, tech giants embark on an AI arms race and regulators worry about\u00a0what could go wrong. \u201cThe tremendous opportunities and significant risks associated with the use of AI by financial companies has moved this issue toward the top\u201d of financial regulators\u2019 agendas, Yellen plans to say in the prepared remarks to be delivered at the conference, which is being held on Thursday at the US Treasury Department and on Friday at the Brookings Institution. The event, including Yellen\u2019s remarks, are set to be live-streamed. On the opportunity side, Yellen will note how AI has already been used by investors to support forecasting and portfolio management and by banks to fight fraud and support customer service, according to the prepared remarks. Going forward, Yellen is expected to say AI\u2019s \u201crapid evolution\u201d could pave the way to make financial services cheaper and easier to access, pointing specifically to advances in natural language processing, image recognition and generative AI. AI chatbots, including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini, have captivated users with their abilities. The latest AI tools can almost instantly conjure up images, spit out song lyrics and some can even generate movie-quality videos. Yellen herself has experimented with AI chatbots, a Treasury official told CNN. \u201cI know all of you here also recognize that the use of AI by financial institutions comes with risks alongside these opportunities,\u201d Yellen said in the prepared remarks. A Treasury official told CNN that the conference is expected to include a mix of regulators, tech executives, asset managers, insurers, academics, civil society organizations and small and large banks. Last December, a team of leading US regulators led by Yellen\u00a0warned for the first time that AI poses a risk to the financial system.\u00a0The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a SWAT team of regulators formed after the 2008 financial crisis, formally designated AI as an \u201cemerging vulnerability.\u201d In her speech, Yellen plans to spell out what could go wrong in financial markets. For instance, Yellen will note that the \u201ccomplexity and opacity\u201d of AI models could cause problems. The problem is that many AI models operate as a \u201cblack box,\u201d meaning their inner workings are impenetrable to outsiders. If Wall Street firms are relying on mysterious AI models, regulators will struggle to understand how safe their systems truly are. Yellen plans to also cite \u201cinadequate risk management frameworks\u201d around AI risks and \u201cinterconnections that emerge as many market participants rely on the same data and models.\u201d In other words, if many investors are all relying on tools that produce the same outcome, it could cause crowded market positions that exacerbate market moves, both to the upside or downside. Likewise, Yellen will say there is a \u201cconcentration\u201d risk linked to the fact that there are only a few companies providing AI models. That means if one goes down, many Wall Street firms could be impacted. Another concern: AI models can at times\u00a0churn out biased results. And that could be a major problem in the real world, especially when it comes to making financial decisions like who gets a loan. \u201cInsufficient or faulty data could also perpetuate or introduce new biases in financial decision making,\u201d Yellen will say, according to the prepared remarks. One major challenge facing AI that Yellen does not address in her speech excerpts: so-called hallucinations. AI models have a history of making stuff up, often in a convincing way. Such\u00a0hallucinations have previously gotten lawyers in trouble\u00a0when they cited case law that did not exist. Yellen is expected to emphasize that regulators plan to continue to monitor AI\u2019s impact on financial stability. Given how fast AI is evolving, Yellen will say that regulators and the industry can use scenario analysis to better understand \u201cfuture vulnerabilities\u201d and what can be done to \u201cenhance resilience.\u201d A Treasury official told CNN that FSOC is working to connect the dots on how AI could pose a threat to the financial system, including by ramping up efforts to monitor how it\u2019s already being used. Of course, US officials themselves are leaning on AI to do their jobs. For instance, the IRS announced last September that it has started\u00a0deploying AI to detect tax cheats. And in February, the Treasury Department disclosed it has\u00a0quietly deployed AI to catch bad guys trying to steal from taxpayers. Treasury plans to do even more with AI in the future. \u201cWe\u2019ve engaged with the public and private sectors on using AI to detect some of the greatest risks we face, from money laundering, to terrorist financing, to sanctions evasion,\u201d Yellen plans to say.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/business/janet-yellen-artificial-intelligence/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_investing_nvidia-stock-apple-microsoft-market-value", "text": "Nvidia, Wall Street\u2019s favorite artificial intelligence darling, is continuing to swell to staggering heights. The AI chipmaker\u2019s market capitalization rose to $3.019 trillion on Wednesday, nudging slightly past Apple\u2019s also $2.99 trillion market cap and making it the second-largest publicly traded company in the US by that measure, just behind Microsoft\u2019s market cap of $3.15 trillion. Nvidia is now the third company in the US, behind Apple and Microsoft, to cross that $3 trillion mark. Shares of the Santa Clara-based chipmaker rose 5.2% to about $1,224.4 a share, while Apple shares ended the session up 0.8% at $196. Those gains also helped boost the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq indexes on Wednesday \u2013 both closed at new record highs. Nvidia (NVDA) has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI mania dominating Wall Street this year; the stock is up 147% so far this year after soaring 239% in 2023. Apple shares, meanwhile, have gained about 1.7% year-to-date. Earlier this week, Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, said that the company would roll out its most advanced AI chip platform, called Rubin, in 2026. The Rubin platform will succeed the Blackwell, which supplies chips for data centers and was announced only\u00a0in March. It was dubbed by Nvidia at the time as the \u201cworld\u2019s most powerful chip.\u201d Nvidia accounts for around 70% of AI semiconductor sales and some analysts think the stock has further to go. \u201cAs we look ahead, we think NVDA is on pace to become the most valuable company, given the plethora of ways it can monetize AI and our belief that it has the largest addressable market expansion opportunity across the Tech sector,\u201d wrote Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research in a note on Wednesday evening. Shares of the company will soon become more affordable. Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split last month, making buying shares in the red-hot semiconductor company more accessible for individual\u00a0investors. The post-split shares will begin trading at market open on June 10.
