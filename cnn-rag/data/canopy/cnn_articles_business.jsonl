But the historic conviction of former President Donald Trump is causing extreme turbulence for Truth Social owner Trump Media & Technology Group. Trump Media \u2013 a notoriously volatile stock since debuting in late March \u2013 has swung between steep losses and sharp gains since a Manhattan jury found the former president guilty on Thursday. The Truth Social owner initially plummeted as much as 15% Thursday evening as the world reacted to the conviction. The stock battled back and opened Friday 4% higher before those gains fizzled. In recent trading, Trump Media is down about 5%. \u201cTrump is the key figure here, so it\u2019s no surprise that a conviction results in extra volatility as traders reassess what that\u00a0means for the company,\u201d Matthew Kennedy, senior IPO market strategist at Renaissance Capital, told CNN in an email on Friday. The former president isn\u2019t just the chairman of Trump Media. He\u2019s the most popular user on Truth Social and the leading shareholder. Trump Media\u2019s ticker symbol is even \u201cDJT.\u201d \u201cThis stock has always represented a bet on Trump winning the 2024 election (and using Truth Social as his primary platform),\u201d Kennedy said. At current levels, Trump\u2019s dominant stake of 114.75 million shares is valued at about $6 billion on paper. That\u2019s despite the fact that Truth Social remains a tiny player in the social media space and the company generates very little revenue. Trump Media posted revenue of just $770,500 during the first quarter, the second-straight quarter of sub-$1 million revenue. The company lost $328 million in the first quarter, driven mostly by one-time losses linked to the controversial merger that brought the company public. Trump Media has been extremely volatile since going public in late March, with some analysts comparing it to a meme stock or even a \u201cmeme stock on steroids.\u201d (Meme stocks typically trade more on social media hype than on fundamentals.)

{"id": "2024_05_28_economy_us-home-prices-case-shiller-march", "text": "US home prices reached a record high in March, reflecting the housing market\u2019s persistent affordability crisis. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index, a measure of home prices across the country, jumped 6.5% in March from a year earlier to a record high. It is the sixth time the index has reached a new record high over the past year. The report showed that there\u2019s strong demand for housing in urban population centers such as San Diego, New York, Cleveland and Los Angeles. The 20-city index rose in March at a slightly faster pace than in February. \u201cThis month\u2019s report boasts another all-time high,\u201d said Brian Luke, head of commodities, real and digital assets, at S&P Dow Jones Indices. \u201cWe\u2019ve witnessed records repeatedly break in both stock and housing markets over the past year.\u201d In addition to unrelentingly high home prices, the housing market is also grappling with a chronic lack of homes on the market and elevated mortgage rates. Put together, it has resulted in a tough housing market, especially first-time buyers. Persistent challenges, but some slight improvements Housing affordability, which factors in incomes, home prices and mortgage rates, remains in the doldrums. But there have been some steps in the right direction recently. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell below 7% last week, after rates began to surge in mid-April. Still, mortgage rates are higher than anything seen in the decade leading up to 2022. Economists don\u2019t expect mortgage rates to decline meaningfully this year and could very well remain above 6%. That\u2019s because inflation got stuck earlier this year, causing the Federal Reserve to push back the timing of its interest rate cut. The Fed\u2019s key interest rate is currently at its highest level in more than two decades. The central bank doesn\u2019t directly set mortgage rates, but its actions do influence them. Mortgage rates track the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, which moves in anticipation of the Fed\u2019s policy moves. One persistent headache for buyers has been sky-high home prices. Annual home price growth is down from a record high of 20.8% in March 2022, but it has picked up steam in the past several months. Since the spring of 2022, there have only been two months in which homes prices declined. A persistent under-supply of housing is a key factor putting some upward pressure on prices, but there have been some consistent improvements this year. The National Association of Realtors reported last week that total housing inventory at the end of April was 1.21 million units, up 9% from the prior month and 16.3% higher from a year earlier. However, that is nowhere close to keeping up with demand, economists say.

{"id": "2024_05_31_economy_pce-inflation-consumer-spending-april", "text": "Inflation\u00a0in April remained at the same stubbornly high level as in March. That means costs continued to rise too fast for consumers, and the\u00a0Federal Reserve\u00a0has more work to do in its fight against rising prices. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index \u2014 a closely watched inflation gauge that the Fed uses for its 2% target \u2014 rose 0.3% from the month before, resulting in an annual rate of 2.7% that matched March\u2019s gain, according to Commerce Department data released Friday. Food prices fell for the month; however, gas prices moved higher by 1.2%. Goods and services prices inched up by 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. On an annual basis, services inflation is running at 3.9%, while goods inflation is nearly flat at 0.1%. Excluding the more volatile categories of food and energy, the core PCE price index slowed for the month, rising 0.2% as compared to a 0.3% gain in March. On an annual basis, the core PCE price index held steady at 2.8% for the third consecutive month. \u201cInflation stuck,\u201d Steven Ricchiuto, US chief economist for Mizuho Securities USA, told CNN in an interview. \u201cThe economy is declining, it\u2019s slowing to trend from above-trend, but it\u2019s still an environment where there\u2019s an exceptionally tight labor market and coming back to trend from above-trend doesn\u2019t make you feel all warm and fuzzy that inflation is going to go down quickly.\u201d Although Friday\u2019s report served as yet another reminder that slowing down inflation is a bumpy process, the results weren\u2019t a complete surprise. Economists, by and large, weren\u2019t expecting much of a meaningful shift in the inflation gauges. Forecasts called for the monthly and annual increases in the overall and core index to be unchanged from March, according to FactSet consensus estimates. \u201cCore PCE inflation fell back to a 0.2% rounded change in April for the first time since late last year, but you might want to hold the applause as the three-digit change was 0.249%, where a mere hundredth [of a percentage point] separates a good from a bad core inflation outcome,\u201d Chris Rupkey, chief economist with FwdBonds, wrote in a note issued Friday. While the overall PCE price index is technically used as the Fed\u2019s target rate, the core index has received more attention from Fed officials because it provides a clearer lens into how underlying inflation is behaving. The Biden administration on Friday released a statement noting that while the cost of living is \u201ctoo high for too many working families,\u201d the latest PCE data showed \u201ccontinued progress [in] bringing down inflation.\u201d \u201cAnnual core inflation is at its lowest level since March 2021, and overall inflation is down 60 percent from its peak,\u201d Lael Brainard, the national economic adviser, said in a statement. \u201cPresident [Joe] Biden is going to keep fighting to lower costs, while congressional Republicans fight to cut taxes for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations.\u201d Sluggish spending and income While inflation remained unchanged, that wasn\u2019t the case for how Americans earned and spent. Consumer spending also cooled for the month, rising just 0.2% as compared to the 0.7% increase recorded for March. Disposable income gains retreated as well, ticking up by 0.2% versus 0.5% in March. When taking inflation into account, both spending and disposable incomes fell for the month, dropping 0.1%. The personal saving rate (savings as a percentage of disposable income) was unchanged at 3.6%, remaining at its lowest level for the year. The PCE indexes are part of the Personal Income and Outlays report, which provides one of the most comprehensive looks at shifts in prices, including how consumers respond to them and how much consumers are spending, earning and saving. Friday\u2019s report was further confirmation that economic activity slowed in April, said Kathy Bostjanic, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist. Earlier this month, retail sales came in flat, and some of the nation\u2019s biggest retailers and restaurants signaled that they were seeing consumers pull back. That trend should continue, Bostjanic said. \u201cWe expect personal income and consumer spending to register sluggish gains in the coming months as businesses reduce the amount of net new hiring and this pinches overall income gains and causes consumers to rein in their spending,\u201d she wrote in commentary issued Friday. The weaker spending likely keeps rate cuts on the table for 2024, Michael Pearce, deputy chief US economist for Oxford Economics, noted Friday. \u201cIt will take a series of more favorable reports before the Fed feels confident enough to begin cutting interest rates,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWith four more inflation reports to go between now and the September [Fed policymaking] meeting, we still think there is a good chance the Fed will cut rates at that meeting.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/economy/pce-inflation-consumer-spending-april/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_economy_low-rate-assumable-mortgages-explained", "text": "For homebuyers struggling to afford a home amid stubbornly high mortgage rates and surging prices, there\u2019s a little-known workaround that can help turn back the clock to the days of ultra-low monthly mortgage payments. But it comes with a few caveats. Assumable mortgages are loans that allow a homebuyer to take over a seller\u2019s existing mortgage. This means that a buyer keeps the seller\u2019s repayment period, mortgage balance and, notably, the seller\u2019s lower mortgage rate. Some experts point to this type of loan as a potential way of reviving the struggling housing market. \u201cIt\u2019s a really great program for today\u2019s market,\u201d said Ted Tozer, the former president of Ginnie Mae \u2014 a government-owned corporation within the Department of Housing and Urban Development \u2014 and a non-resident fellow at the Urban Institute. About 12.2 million US mortgages are assumable, according to data from Intercontinental Exchange. That amounts to 23% of all US mortgages. But while assumable loans could benefit both sides of a homebuying transaction, there are some drawbacks, including a longer approval process, Tozer said. \u201cThe sellers should be able to get an extra 1% or 2% for their home to compensate them for the value they are transferring,\u201d he said. \u201cThe buyers\u2019 advantage is that they can have a lower mortgage payment over the life of the loan than they would have gotten with a new mortgage.\u201d A little-used benefit of government loans Ellen Harper, a software analyst in her mid-50s, closed on a Fairburn, Georgia, home with a 2.49% mortgage rate in April after first learning about assumable mortgages in the fall. Securing that ultra-low mortgage rate means that Harper will save thousands of dollars in monthly payments. In mid-April, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7.10%, reaching the highest level since November. \u201cI just decided I wanted to see how low I could pay on the interest rate,\u201d Harper said. \u201cI went into it looking for the best deal I could get, and I think I did pretty good.\u201d Not all home loans can be passed to a homebuyer, but most government-backed loans, such as those from the Federal Housing Administration and the US Department of Veterans Affairs, are assumable. The number of FHA-backed loans assumed grew 111% between 2021 and 2023, while the number of VA-backed loans assumed grew 713% in that same time period, according to government data provided to CNN. Still, in the American real estate market, mortgage assumptions are relatively rare. There have been just 2,973 FHA-backed mortgage assumptions so far this year, according to the agency. How does an assumable mortgage work? The process of assuming an existing mortgage is a bit different from getting approved for a new home loan. For example, suppose a seller with an assumable loan chooses to list their home at $500,000 and their current mortgage balance is $300,000. In that case, that home seller currently has $200,000 in equity (the difference between $500,000 and $300,000). To take over that seller\u2019s mortgage, a buyer would have to make a cash payment of $200,000 to the seller to compensate for their equity stake. Then, the buyer would take over the sellers\u2019 existing monthly payments on their mortgage. For buyers, $200,000 may be a lot of money to pay upfront. Some take out a second mortgage to cover the equity payment, Tozer said. And while the mortgage rate on the second loan may be high, the total monthly payment could still be lower \u2014 if the assumed mortgage rate is low enough. Generally, an assumable loan must be approved by the seller\u2019s lender and the VA, FHA, or other government agency backing the loan. That means not only are there more layers to get through, but a homebuyer must also meet specific credit and income standards before getting approval. Is there a catch? Snagging a low mortgage rate like Harper\u2019s in today\u2019s high interest rate environment may seem like a dream come true to some prospective homebuyers, but the process is not always smooth sailing. Tozer said lenders often delay approving mortgage assumptions because the VA and FHA cap the amount of money the lenders can make processing these applications. \u201cPeople have complained that the assumptions are taking substantially long periods of time to close and because of that, sellers are getting frustrated and the Realtors want their money,\u201d Tozer said. Another potential downside for holders of VA-guaranteed loans: According to the department, passing your mortgage along to a civilian may slow down your ability to get approved for another VA loan. Even so, assumable mortgages may hold an appeal for homebuyers who missed the boat on lower interest rates. Finding an assumable mortgage with a willing seller may be akin to \u201cunicorn hunting,\u201d said one commenter on social media. The relative rarity of these mortgages also means some folks may have misconceptions about how they work. For example, Harper said her seller was initially skeptical about her taking over their home loan, erroneously believing he\u2019d be on the hook if Harper missed mortgage payments after taking over the mortgage. \u201cWe put in an offer a couple of times in the beginning and he wasn\u2019t comfortable, so the offer expired without him accepting it,\u201d she said of her homeseller. Harper used Roam, one of a growing group of real estate start-ups focused on helping buyers find homes that allow mortgage assumptions. For now, Roam is only available in Georgia, Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Florida, but Roam\u2019s CEO, Raunaq Singh, told CNN he plans to launch nationwide later this year. Harper said the company helped educate her home\u2019s seller about assumable mortgages, reassuring him that he would no longer be responsible for the loan once it was taken over by Harper. Harper\u2019s persistence paid off. \u201cAfter that, he did sign the offer,\u201d she said.

{"id": "2024_05_31_business_india-gdp-q4-growth-intl-hnk", "text": "India\u2019s economy grew\u00a0by more than 8% in the fiscal year that ended in March, according to data published Friday that gives a boost to Prime Minister Narendra Modi just hours before the country concludes its mammoth, weeks-long national election. Gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 8.2%, according to the Statistics Ministry, cementing India\u2019s status as the world\u2019s fastest growing major economy. The rate of growth was higher than the Modi government\u2019s forecast of 7.6%. For the final quarter of the fiscal year, GDP expanded at a faster-than-expected rate of 7.8%, compared with the same period in 2023. GDP\u00a0had risen by 8.6% in the October-December period. \u201cWe expect economic activity to moderate a bit further over the coming quarters, but India will remain a global outperformer,\u201d said Ankita Amajuri, assistant economist at Capital Economics. There\u2019s less than 24 hours to go before polls close in the election. Modi is running on his economic record over the past 10 years, a period of robust growth for India. The country went from the ninth largest economy in the world to the fifth largest during that time. It also experienced the largest percentage growth in GDP over the decade compared to other major economies. Results will be declared on June 4. If Modi wins a third term, \u201cany deceleration (in the economy) will be mild,\u201d added Amajuri. Sustained expansion will push India higher up the ranks of the world\u2019s biggest economies, with some observers forecasting the country to become number three behind only the US and China by 2027. India is widely seen as an alternative to China for countries and companies looking to diversify their supply chains, particularly as the relationship between Washington and Beijing sours. Some of the world\u2019s biggest companies, including Apple (AAPL) supplier Foxconn, are already expanding their operations there. \u201cAfter China, India is the only economy that can achieve economies of scale, due to its large market,\u201d wrote Nomura economists in a report earlier this week. \u201cIndia is one of the few economies that is garnering investor interest across a variety of sectors,\u201d they added. Despite the euphoria surrounding the growth figures, economists say there are enormous challenges facing the Indian economy in the next decade. The new government will have to create hundreds of millions of jobs for a population that remains largely impoverished. With an average age of 29 years, India\u2019s population is one of the youngest globally, but the country is not yet able to reap the potential economic benefits from its youthful demographics. According to a recent report by the International Labour Organization, educated Indians between the ages of 15 and 29 are more likely to be unemployed than those without any schooling, which reflects \u201ca mismatch with their aspirations and available jobs.\u201d Youth unemployment rates in India are now higher than global levels, it said. Analysts fear that if Modi\u2019s party underperforms in the polls, it may put key land and labor reforms on the backburner. But one of the biggest long-term threats facing the Indian economy is climate change. The country is particularly vulnerable to extreme heat and some places there are pushing the limits of human survivability, experts say. Earlier this week, India\u2019s capital territory of Delhi recorded its highest-ever temperature of 49.9 degrees Celsius (121.8 degrees Fahrenheit), and the oppressive heat wave forced authorities to impose water rationing. Rising mercury levels in India risks reversing progress on poverty alleviation, health and economic growth, experts say. The country is\u00a0\u201cexpected to lose about 5.8% of daily working hours due\u00a0to heat stress in 2030,\u201d said a\u00a0United Nations\u2019\u00a0Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific\u00a0(ESCAP) report in April. \u201cThe problem is most\u00a0severe for outdoor workers, particularly those employed in agriculture and construction, but also relevant for indoor\u00a0factory workers,\u201d it added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/business/india-gdp-q4-growth-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products.

{"id": "2024_05_31_media_fox-news-trump-conviction", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s media allies are demanding retribution in the wake of his conviction. Following\u00a0weeks of\u00a0attacks targeting the historic hush money case against the former president, prominent right-wing media figures immediately flooded the public discourse Thursday with extreme and disturbing rhetoric after Trump was found guilty on 34 felony counts. On\u00a0Fox News\u00a0and other right-wing outlets, pro-Trump media personalities erupted in anger, blaming everyone from\u00a0Judge\u00a0Juan Merchan\u00a0and Manhattan District Attorney\u00a0Alvin Bragg\u00a0to\u00a0President Joe Biden\u00a0and the entire U.S. justice system for the \u201cdisgraceful\u201d conviction. While not surprising, the furious bluster reverberating across right-wing media still carried its intended effect, burning away public trust in America\u2019s core institutions and leaving a lasting impact on the legitimacy of the rule of law in the United States. The toxic commentary is also enflaming desires of retribution held by Trump supporters, with popular right-wing media figures openly declaring their hope that the GOP candidate to nakedly seek revenge against his critics, should he emerge victorious in November and return to the Oval Office. Indeed, it is not only that\u00a0MAGA Media\u00a0personalities are assailing the guilty verdict returned by a jury of 12 New Yorkers, calling it unfair and rigged. Some of the right\u2019s most popular talking heads are openly calling for the weaponization of government to seek retribution against Trump\u2019s political opponents. The Daily Wire\u2019s Matt Walsh, who commands a following of millions of subscribers on\u00a0YouTube\u00a0and social media, said after the verdict that Trump \u201cshould make and publish a list of ten high ranking Democrat criminals who he will have arrested when he takes office.\u201d\u00a0The Federalist\u00a0chief executive\u00a0Sean Davis\u00a0said he wants \u201cto see lists of which Democrat officials are going to be put in prison.\u201d And\u00a0Fox News\u2019 Jesse Watters\u00a0declared, \u201cWe\u2019re going to vanquish the evil forces that are destroying this republic.\u201d Suffice to say, that unhinged, reckless, and dangerous rhetoric is not normal. And it even exceeds some of the highly charged rhetoric that played out during Trump\u2019s administration when then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u00a0probed the then-president over his ties to Russia. But as the legal walls\u00a0actually\u00a0begin to close in on Trump, the commentary in right-wing media is getting angrier, more menacing, and taking a markedly darker tone. In the hours after the verdict was handed down Thursday, talk of the United States having transformed into a third-world dictatorship was the\u00a0norm\u00a0in pro-Trump media, with the term \u201cbanana republic\u201d regularly tossed around. In fact, there was little room for disagreement with the radical and warped viewpoint. \u201cImport the Third World, become the Third World. That\u2019s what we just saw,\u201d right-wing extremist\u00a0Tucker Carlson\u00a0declared on\u00a0X. \u201cThis won\u2019t stop Trump. He\u2019ll win the election if he\u2019s not killed first. But it does mark the end of the fairest justice system in the world. Anyone who defends this verdict is a danger to you and your family.\u201d As has become the new normal, Fox News also promoted a parade of dishonest right-wing talking points to its sizable audience.\u00a0Laura Ingraham\u00a0declared that \u201cthe Democrats are showing [the country] what real power is \u2026 the type of power we usually see dictators exercise in China and Cuba and North Korea.\u201d\u00a0Sean Hannity\u00a0complained that \u201cthe foundation of our constitutional republic\u201d is \u201cliterally dying before your eyes.\u201d That rhetoric is, obviously, detached from reality. The United States is not a third world country. Trump got his day in court and was treated by the judge, by all accounts, quite fairly.\u00a0Biden did not direct so-called deep state forces to engage in \u201clawfare\u201d against Trump. But the endless streams of poison flooding into the public discourse comes with consequences. It not only offers a preview of just how ugly the 2024 race will soon become, it sets the stage for Trump, if he manages to make his way back into the White House, to abuse power and deform the federal institutions to serve his purposes. Perversely, it has primed a swath of Americans into believing that such behavior would not only be warranted, but\u00a0necessary.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/media/fox-news-trump-conviction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_tech_threats-doxxing-trump-jurors", "text": "On online forums that have previously been linked to mass shootings,\u00a0people are threatening\u00a0violence and attempting to publicly identify the 12 New York jurors who on Thursday decided to convict former President Donald Trump. The calls for retribution began immediately after the verdict was announced. Experts who track online extremism told CNN the volume of violent rhetoric in the last 24 hours is\u00a0as high as it was after the FBI\u2019s search\u00a0of Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago property in August 2022. \u201cHope these jurors face some street justice,\u201d one anonymous user on a pro-Trump forum wrote. Another suggestively asked, \u201cWouldn\u2019t [it] be interesting if just one person from Trump\u2019s legal team anonymously leaked the names of the jurors?\u201d Anonymity is supposed to add a layer of protection for jurors doing their civic duty. Once reserved only for cases involving violent criminal enterprises, the practice is becoming more common. The judge in the Trump New York trial\u00a0issued an order in March\u00a0agreeing with prosecutors that most information about the jurors would be sealed. Trump\u2019s lawyers did not disagree, according to the order. Overnight, however, anonymous internet users on sites that are known havens of hate and harassment began\u00a0sharing names, home addresses and other personal information belonging to people they say might have been members of the jury,\u00a0a practice known as doxxing. This form of amateur online sleuthing can lead to real-life security issues. For example, a commonly used tactic called \u201cswatting\u201d involves a caller making a bogus crime report intended to trigger a massive law enforcement response to a target\u2019s residence. In the past, people whose personal information have been shared online in this way have been misidentified and sometimes have nothing at all to do with the issue at hand. \u201cUnfortunately, social media has given rise to a whole generation of amateur sleuthing that lacks journalism standards and ethics, leading to countless examples of mistaken identities and wrongful accusations,\u201d Ben Decker, the CEO of Memetica, a threat analysis company, told CNN Friday. \u201cWhile the sleuthers themselves face few, if any, consequences, the victims of these accusations become the targets of violent threats both on and offline,\u201d he added. Violent rhetoric targeting other people involved in the case, including the presiding judge, the district attorney and journalists who reported on the case, was identified by researchers at Advance Democracy, a nonprofit organization that conducts public-interest research, the group\u2019s president, Daniel Jones, told CNN Friday. Last summer, purported names, photographs and home addresses of grand jurors in Fulton County, Georgia, circulated on the far-right internet after the grand jury voted to indict Trump. Similarly, after the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago in 2022, a Florida court removed information, including the office address, of a federal magistrate judge from its website, after internet users began targeting the judge, claiming the judge had signed off on the search warrant. The volume of violent online rhetoric seen on anti-government and extremists forums in the 24 hours since Trump\u2019s conviction is as high as it was in the wake of the FBI\u2019s\u00a0search\u00a0of Mar-a-Lago property in August 2022, according to John Cohen, former acting undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at the Department of Homeland Security. The Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a nonprofit that tracks extremism, released data Friday showing that about 9,300 online postings mentioned civil unrest within a day of the Trump conviction, compared to 9,900 unrest-related posts after the Mar-a-Lago search. In September 2019, after House Democrats announced Trump\u2019s first impeachment inquiry and Trump quoted a pastor on Twitter warning of a \u201cCivil War-like fracture\u201d in the country if Trump was removed from office, unrest-related online posts numbered nearly 20,000, according to ISD. \u201c[F]alse and misleading narratives surrounding the verdict [have] the potential to serve as a catalyst for individual acts of violence and other illegal activity, while also continuing to increase distrust in our democratic institutions,\u201d ISD analysts wrote. Days after the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago in August 2022, an armed man who had directed increasingly violent online rhetoric at the FBI\u00a0tried to breach\u00a0the bureau\u2019s Cincinnati office and was killed in an armed standoff with FBI agents. Some of the violent language in the last 24 hours is \u201ca direct illustration of what concerns law enforcement as we get closer and closer to the election,\u201d Cohen said, calling it \u201ca harbinger of what\u2019s to come.\u201d Foreign intelligence services and terrorist groups will likely try to amplify the online vitriol in the coming days and weeks, he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/tech/threats-doxxing-trump-jurors/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Inflation appears to be coming down after signs of sticking early this year. Americans aren\u2019t convinced it will continue to cool. A slew of big-box retailers have lowered prices on items in recent weeks, citing moderating inflation and frugal customers. Walmart rolled back prices on nearly 7,000 items in its stores. Target slashed prices on more than 1,500 items, ranging from laundry detergent to cat food to sunscreen, with thousands more price cuts expected over the summer. Amazon Fresh is discounting thousands of grocery items. Ikea and Aldi have also reduced prices. Recent economic data has also suggested that inflation is cooling, after data earlier this year spurred fears that progress had stalled. The latest Consumer Price Index report showed prices rose 3.4% for the 12 months ended in April, easing from 3.5% the prior month. Core CPI, which strips out the more volatile food and energy categories, slowed to 3.6%, its lowest rate since April 2021. But Americans seem unsure that inflation\u2019s downward trajectory will last. The Conference Board\u2019s latest Consumer Confidence Index released Tuesday revealed that average 12-month inflation projections rose to 5.4%, and the share of consumers that expect higher interest rates in the year ahead climbed to 56.2%. There\u2019s long been a divergence between the way the economy looks on paper and the way it feels for everyday Americans. Stocks have notched repeated record highs, and corporate earnings are robust. The unemployment rate is at a historic low. Yet Americans don\u2019t seem convinced that inflation is moderating or that the economy is as healthy as indicators suggest. And it\u2019s no wonder: US home prices hit a record high in March, underscoring the affordability crisis slamming prospective buyers. Mortgage rates have declined in recent weeks but remain near 7%. Grocery prices began easing last month but only slightly. Menu prices are still high, particularly at fast food chains. Even high-income consumers, who have helped power the economy as rates remain elevated and lower-income Americans tighten their purse strings, are pulling back. Inflation concerns have also jumped among everyday investors. The share of respondents in Charles Schwab\u2019s second-quarter sentiment survey reporting inflation as a primary concern around investing climbed to 19%, more than doubling from the prior year. \u201cTraders began the year feeling pretty confident that the economy was improving and Fed rate cuts would be quick to follow,\u201d said James Kostulias, head of trading services at Charles Schwab, in a release. \u201cBut inflation concerns have jumped significantly.\u201d Wall Street will get its next look at the state of inflation when the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the Federal Reserve\u2019s favorite inflation gauge, is posted Friday morning. Some Fed officials have said they are no longer worried about reaccelerating inflation after the April CPI report broke a streak of warm inflation data released during the first quarter. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said following the central bank\u2019s May policy meeting that while inflation is still too high to begin lowering rates, \u201clonger-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored.\u201d While Powell also ruled out another rate hike, not all Fed officials are on the same page. Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari said Tuesday that he believes all options to tamp down inflation are still on the table and that he wants to see \u201cmany more months\u201d of cooling inflation data before lowering rates. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing the need to hurry and do rate cuts. I think we should take our time and get it right,\u201d he told CNBC. Schumer and Senate Democrats call for Justice Department to probe Big Oil for alleged collusion Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and nearly two dozen Democrats pressed the Justice Department on Thursday to launch an industry-wide investigation into Big Oil for alleged collusion and price fixing. In a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland, Schumer and his colleagues expressed \u201cserious concern\u201d about \u201calarming\u201d allegations from federal regulators that a\u00a0Texas oil tycoon tried to conspire with OPEC\u00a0to inflate oil and gasoline prices. \u201cThe federal government must use every tool to prevent and prosecute collusion and price fixing that may have increased gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil and jet fuel costs in a way that has materially harmed virtually every American household and business,\u201d the letter from Senate Democrats said. The lawmakers urged the DOJ to investigate the oil industry, \u201chold accountable any liable actors\u201d and halt illegal activity. The letter, led by Schumer, was signed by 22 other senators, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders and Dick Durbin. The letter shows how Democrats are\u00a0stepping up pressure on Big Oil\u00a0following bombshell accusations earlier this month by the Federal Trade Commission against Scott Sheffield, the longtime CEO of a leading Texas oil producer.

Zero-down mortgages are making a comeback Many Americans would love to buy a home, but they don\u2019t have tens of thousands of dollars to cover a down payment, reports my colleague Matt Egan. That massive roadblock is being removed by a\u00a0new zero-percent down mortgage program\u00a0launched two weeks ago by one of the nation\u2019s largest mortgage lenders. However, the new program, offered by United Wholesale Mortgage, is making some experts nervous about how these loans could backfire on homeowners \u2014 especially if home prices stop going to the moon. And for some, it\u2019s bringing back bad memories of the\u00a0subprime mortgage meltdown\u00a0that fueled the 2008 financial crisis. UWM, led by\u00a0Mat Ishbia, the billionaire owner of the Phoenix Suns NBA team, said homebuyers who qualify won\u2019t need to put down an upfront down payment. Instead, the program will allow buyers to pay for 97% of the home\u2019s value with a first mortgage and then provide the remaining 3% (up to $15,000) in the form of a second mortgage. That second mortgage won\u2019t accrue interest, but it will need to be paid back \u2014 in full as a balloon payment \u2014 when the home is sold, the mortgage is paid off or if the owner refinances.

Rosenthal\u00a0\u2014\u00a0reveals\u00a0a tiny badge with the words \u201cAI.\u201d\u00a0These are not real bylines. In fact,\u00a0the\u00a0names don\u2019t even belong to real humans. The\u00a0articles were written with\u00a0the use of\u00a0artificial\u00a0intelligence. The outlet,\u00a0Hoodline,\u00a0is not the first or only\u00a0news site\u00a0to\u00a0harness\u00a0AI. News organizations across the world are grappling with how to take advantage of the\u00a0rapidly developing technology, while also not being overrun by it. But experts warn that relying too heavily on AI could wreck\u00a0the\u00a0credibility\u00a0of news organizations and potentially supercharge the spread of misinformation if not kept in close check. Media companies integrating AI in news publishing have also seen it backfire, resulting in public embarrassments. Tech outlet CNET\u2019s AI-generated articles made embarrassing factual errors. The nation\u2019s largest newspaper chain owner, Gannett, pulled back on an AI experiment reporting on high school sports games after public mockery. Sports Illustrated deleted several articles from its website after they were found to have been published under fake author names. Hoodline,\u00a0founded in 2014 as a San Francisco-based hyper-local news outlet\u00a0with a mission\u00a0\u201cto cover the\u00a0news deserts\u00a0that no one else is covering,\u201d\u00a0once employed a newsroom full of\u00a0human journalists.\u00a0The outlet has since expanded into a national network of local websites, covering news and events in major cities across the country and drawing millions of readers each month, the company said. But last year, Hoodline began filling its site with AI-generated articles. A disclaimer page linked at the bottom of its pages notes to readers,\u00a0\u201cWhile AI may assist in the background, the essence of our journalism \u2014 from conception to publication \u2014 is driven by real human insight and discretion.\u201d Zachary Chen,\u00a0chief executive of\u00a0Hoodline parent company Impress3, which\u00a0acquired the site in 2020, defended the\u00a0site\u2019s\u00a0use of AI and its\u00a0transparency with readers, telling CNN the\u00a0outlet\u00a0provides valuable reporting in\u00a0news deserts\u00a0around the country\u00a0and is generating revenue to hire more\u00a0human\u00a0journalists\u00a0in the future. Hoodline\u2019s staff includes \u201cdozens of editors, as well as dozens of journalist researchers, full time,\u201d Chen said. The outlet also employs a \u201cgrowing number of on-the-ground journalists who research and write original stories about their neighborhood beats,\u201d\u00a0he added, referencing\u00a0recent articles about restaurants,\u00a0retail\u00a0stores and events\u00a0in the\u00a0San Francisco\u00a0area. Bios for bots But until recently, the site had further blurred the line between reality and illusion. Screenshots captured last year by\u00a0the Internet Archive and local outlet Gazetteer\u00a0showed Hoodline had\u00a0further embellished its AI author bylines with\u00a0what appeared to be AI-generated headshots resembling real people and fake biographical information. \u201cNina is a long-time writer and a Bay Area Native who writes about good food & delicious drink, tantalizing tech & bustling business,\u201d one biography claimed. The\u00a0fake headshots and biographies\u00a0have since\u00a0been removed from the\u00a0site,\u00a0replaced with a small \u201cAI\u201d badge next to\u00a0each\u00a0machine-assisted\u00a0article\u2019s byline, though they still carry\u00a0human\u00a0names. The archived screenshots have also been wiped from much of the internet. Wayback Machine director Mark Graham told CNN\u00a0that archived pages of Hoodline\u2019s AI writers were removed last month \u201cat the request of the rights holder of the site.\u201d Chen acknowledged the company requested that the archive\u2019s screenshots of the site be removed from the internet, saying\u00a0\u201csome websites have taken outdated screenshots from months or even years ago to mischaracterize our present-day practices.\u201d \u201cAn empty gesture toward transparency\u201d But experts expressed alarm over Hoodline\u2019s practices, warning that\u00a0it\u00a0exemplifies the potential pitfalls and perils of using AI in journalism, threatening to diminish public trust in news. The way the site uses and discloses AI purposely tricks readers by \u201cmimicking\u201d the look and feel of a \u201cstandards-based local news organization with real journalists,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Peter Adams, a senior vice president of the News Literacy Project, which aims to\u00a0educate the public on identifying credible information. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of flagrantly opaque way to dupe people into thinking that they\u2019re reading actual reporting by an actual journalist who has a concern for being fair, for being accurate, for being transparent,\u201d Adams\u00a0told CNN. The small \u201cAI\u201d badge\u00a0that now appears\u00a0next to fake\u00a0author personas on the site is \u201can empty gesture toward transparency rather than actually exercising transparency,\u201d Adams\u00a0added. Chen\u00a0would\u00a0not disclose what AI system Hoodline\u00a0is employing, only calling it \u201cour own proprietary and custom-built software, combined with the most cutting-edge AI partners to craft publish-ready, fact-based article.\u201d Each article, Chen said, is overseen by editors before it is published. Gazetteer previously reported that at least two\u00a0Hoodline\u00a0employees said\u00a0on LinkedIn\u00a0that they\u00a0were based in the Philippines,\u00a0far from the US cities that the outlet purports to cover.\u00a0Chen\u00a0did not respond to CNN\u2019s\u00a0question\u00a0about its staff or where they are located. The\u00a0News/Media\u00a0Alliance, which represents more than 2,200 US publishers, has supported\u00a0news organizations\u00a0taking legal action against AI developers who are harvesting\u00a0news\u00a0content without permission.\u00a0Danielle Coffey,\u00a0the\u00a0group\u2019s chief executive, told CNN that Hoodline\u2019s content \u201cis likely a violation of copyright law.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s another example of stealing our content without permission and without compensation to then turn around and compete with the original work,\u201d Coffey said. \u201cWithout quality news in the first place, this type of content among other practices will become unsustainable over time, as quality news will simply disappear.\u201d Chen told CNN he takes copyright\u00a0law\u00a0very seriously and that\u00a0the outlet has\u00a0\u201cgreatly refined processes with heavy guardrails.\u201d\u00a0The site\u2019s readers, he asserted,\u00a0\u201cappreciate the unbiased nature of our AI-assisted news,\u201d and claimed Hoodline\u2019s visitor traffic has soared twentyfold since the publication was acquired. (Chen did not specify their traffic numbers.) That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t a place for AI in a newsroom. It can\u00a0assist journalists\u00a0in research and data processing and\u00a0reduce costs\u00a0in an industry\u00a0struggling\u00a0with tighter budgets.\u00a0Some news organizations, like News Corp., are increasingly inking lucrative partnerships with AI developers like OpenAI\u00a0to help bolster its large language models\u2019 knowledge base. But Hoodline\u2019s use of\u00a0machine-written articles under seemingly human names is not the way to do it, said Felix Simon,\u00a0a\u00a0research fellow in AI and digital news at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford. \u201cEmploying AI to help local journalists save time so they can focus on doing more in-depth investigations is qualitatively different from churning out a high amount of low-quality stories that do nothing to provide people with timely and relevant information about what is happening in their community, or that provides\u00a0them with a better understanding of how the things happening around them will end up affecting them,\u201d Simon told CNN. Research conducted by Simon\u00a0and\u00a0Benjamin Toff, a journalism professor at the University of Minnesota, has also found that the public has not embraced the use of AI in news reporting. \u201cWe found that people are somewhat less trusting of news labelled as AI, and there is reason to believe that people won\u2019t be as willing to pay for news generated purely with AI,\u201d he said. Keeping local news alive On\u00a0Hoodline\u2019s\u00a0network of local news sites, it is difficult to find an article not written by the software.\u00a0Much of the\u00a0site\u2019s content\u00a0appears to be\u00a0rewritten\u00a0directly from press releases,\u00a0social media postings\u00a0or aggregated from\u00a0other news organizations.\u00a0Chen\u00a0said the outlet aims to\u00a0\u201calways provide proper attribution\u201d and follow \u201cfair use\u201d practices. \u201cLocal news has been on a terrible downward trend for two decades, and as we expand, Hoodline is able to bring local stories that provide insight into what\u2019s going on at a hyper-local level, even in so-called \u2018news deserts,\u2019\u201d Chen said. The outlet, which is profitable,\u00a0Chen said, plans to hire more human journalists as the company looks\u00a0to\u00a0evolve\u00a0its\u00a0current AI personas into \u201cAI news anchors delivering stories in short-form videos.\u201d The plan will make use of the fake bylines published on the site, eventually turning them into AI news readers, he said. \u201cIt would not make sense for an AI news anchor to be named \u2018Hoodline San Francisco\u2019 or \u2018Researched by Person A & Edited by Persona B.\u2019 This is what we are building toward,\u201d Chen said. Nuala Bishari,\u00a0a former Hoodline reporter,\u00a0wrote in\u00a0a recent column\u00a0for the San Francisco Chronicle that seeing her old job replaced by AI is \u201csurreal.\u201d \u201cOld-fashioned shoe-leather reporting has been replaced by fake people who\u2019ve never set foot in any of the neighborhoods they write about \u2014 because they don\u2019t have feet,\u201d Bishari wrote. But the transformation at Hoodline shows that bigger solutions are needed to keep vital local news reporting alive. \u201cWithout a big shift, journalism as we know it will continue to sputter out,\u201d she wrote.\u201cAnd it isn\u2019t just tiny outlets like Hoodline that are in danger of going extinct or being zombified by AI.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/media/ai-bylines-local-news-hoodline/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_business_uk-royal-mail-sale", "text": "The owner of Royal Mail has accepted a \u00a33.57 billion ($4.6 billion) takeover bid from Czech billionaire Daniel K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd, paving the way for the sale of one of Britain\u2019s oldest and most iconic institutions to a foreign owner for the first time. International Distribution Services, which owns the loss-making postal service, said Wednesday that it had accepted a \u00a33.70-per-share ($4.69) takeover offer from K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd\u2019s EP Group. The deal has consequences for thousands of workers and has sparked anxiety about the future of a key piece of national infrastructure, which delivers a vital public service. EP Group has made several commitments to address these concerns, including upholding Royal Mail\u2019s \u201cuniversal service obligation,\u201d which requires it to deliver letters six days a week everywhere in the United Kingdom for the same flat fee. It has also promised to maintain employee benefits and pensions, and keep Royal Mail\u2019s headquarters and tax base in the UK. \u201cThe EP group has the utmost respect for Royal Mail\u2019s history and tradition, and I know that owning this business will come with enormous responsibility \u2014 not just to the employees but to the citizens who rely on its services every day,\u201d K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd said in a statement. He added that IDS has the potential \u201cto become one of the largest postal logistics groups in Europe,\u201d but that its \u201cmarket is evolving quickly\u201d and it must modernize to keep up with rival delivery services. K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd\u2019s Vesa Equity Investment, a private equity firm, is already the largest shareholder in IDS, with a 27.6% stake. Politically sensitive The deal follows a torrid few years for Royal Mail, which was privatized in 2013. It has suffered a sharp drop in demand for its services and recorded a loss of \u00a3348 million ($445 million) for the year that ended on March 31 \u2014 a slightly better result than the previous year when it lost \u00a3419 million ($536 million). \u201cThe IDS Board believes that the offer from EP is fair and reasonable given that there are uncertainties ahead and allows investors to realise value at a significant premium,\u201d IDS chairman Keith Williams said in the statement. Not everyone is convinced, however. Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, which represents about 110,000 Royal Mail workers, said the takeover was \u201ca direct result of a failed and ideological privatisation over a decade ago mixed with the blatant mismanagement of the company in recent years.\u201d Workers wanted further commitments from EP Group on the future of the company, he said. \u201cWe do welcome some of the commitments that have been made but the reality is postal workers across the UK have lost all faith in the senior management of Royal Mail and the service has been deliberately run down,\u201d he added in a statement. K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd\u2019s move comes at a sensitive moment politically as the United Kingdom gears up for a general election on July 4. The proposed takeover will be subject to a national security review, possibly by a new government. Opinion polls suggest the Labour Party will win its first election since 2005 and replace the incumbent Conservative administration. Labour has already taken a keen interest in the deal. \u201cRoyal Mail is as British as it gets, and Labour will take the necessary steps to safeguard its undeniable identity and place in public life,\u201d Jonathan Reynolds, the party\u2019s business spokesperson, wrote in a letter to K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd earlier this month. A low-profile Czech national, K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd made his fortune through a sprawling empire of European energy companies, retailers and football clubs. He is worth an estimated $7.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and owns a 27% stake in West Ham United Football Club.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/business/uk-royal-mail-sale/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

And as insurance companies struggle to stay afloat, battered by elevated inflation and the growing frequency of catastrophic storms made worse by climate change, it\u2019s become even tougher for homeowners to find affordable insurance options. Just last year, rates jumped 11.3% nationwide, according to S&P Global, and experts don\u2019t expect a reprieve this year. And while there are ways to try and save money on insurance costs, moving to a state with minimal hurricane risk isn\u2019t going to be enough anymore. States like Arizona, Illinois and Utah, which aren\u2019t generally considered at risk from hurricane damage, have seen increases that far outpaced the national average last year. What\u2019s behind insurance price hikes? For decades, homeowners insurance was considered a very stable line of business for insurance companies, said Chuck Nyce, a professor of risk management and insurance at Florida State University. Most claims involved events affecting a single home, like an electrical fire or a washing machine leak. But more recently, there has been an uptick in catastrophic hurricanes, wildfires\u00a0and convective storms \u2013 like severe thunderstorms and tornadoes,\u00a0Nyce said. \u201cThese storms don\u2019t only affect one property at a time. They affect a large number of properties,\u201d he said. \u201cThat changes the dynamic for an insurance company.\u201d And unlike hurricanes and wildfires, severe convective storms are hitting states that were once considered relatively \u201csafe\u201d from most natural disasters, driving up insurance costs. Last year was the worst year for the homeowners insurance industry in over a decade, according to a May report from S&P Global. \u201cInflationary pressures, a devastating wildfire in Hawaii and a record-breaking number of billion-dollar loss events from convective storms weighed on the industry\u2019s results in 2023,\u201d the report said. The US homeowners insurance industry saw net losses jump to $101.29 billion in 2023, according to the report. Only two of the 20 largest US homeowners\u2019 insurance companies were profitable last year. And today\u2019s elevated inflaton means that when property gets damaged, it costs insurance companies significantly more to make repairs compared to a few years ago, said Lynne McChristian, the director of the office of risk management and insurance research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \u201cThe thing that many people don\u2019t realize is what you pay for property insurance is based on the rebuilding cost of your home, not the real estate value,\u201d she said. \u201cUnderstand that the price you pay for insurance is sending you a signal.\u201d The higher the premiums, the more likely the area you live in is at risk, she said. What happens if I can\u2019t get insurance? As insurance companies struggle to make a profit, policyholders lose out, as well. Some are subject to rate increases, while others are losing their coverage altogether. Florida and California have been hit particularly hard by this phenomenon. Many national insurers have withdrawn property coverage from those states due to elevated risks of hurricanes and wildfires, respectively. But the issue is spreading: states like Louisiana, North Carolina and Texas are seeing insurers head for the exits, as well. While property insurance is not mandated by law, most lenders require it for mortgage holders. That can leave many homeowners carrying mortgages scrambling if they are unexpectedly dropped from their insurance. Most states have something called an \u201cinsurer of last resort,\u201d which is a state government-backed insurance provider designed to fill coverage gaps in the private insurance market. These state-backed insurance plans vary by state, but they can be costly or provide less coverage, said Nyce. Still, these government-backed insurance companies have ballooned in popularity as some homeowners run out of options. Last year, Florida\u2019s state-backed Citizens Property Insurance Corp. became the 10th largest homeowners\u2019 insurer in the US, S&P Global said. How to lower insurance costs For those who still have insurance options in their area but are worried about increased costs, there are some simple ways to lower your insurance costs. Nyce said it\u2019s important to shop around every couple of years to see if other companies are offering more competitive rates. \u201cSome insurance companies may be looking to add business in your area. They may be willing to sell something at a lower rate to gain market share,\u201d he said. Raising your deductible, the amount of money a person must pay before your insurance kicks in, could also help lower premiums, if you can afford it, Nyce said. But another way to protect yourself is to shell out money now to \u201charden\u201d your home in order to avoid high insurance costs when the next disaster strikes. That can mean investing in ways to fortify your home\u2019s structure, like metal straps that attach your roof to a home\u2019s walls and wind-resistant garage doors, said Aris Papadopoulos, who works at Florida International University\u2019s Extreme Events Institute. \u201cWe all love to have a pretty kitchen, pretty closets and bathrooms, but before you do any of that, make sure your house is strong,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/economy/homeowners-insurance-cost-hurricane-weather/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_tech_china-apple-sales-rebound-price-cuts-intl-hnk", "text": "A rebound in Apple\u2019s iPhone sales in China is gaining momentum, after the company aggressively cut prices in its largest overseas market to lure back consumers actively hunting bargains in a weak economy. Shipments of foreign-branded cell phones in China, the vast majority of which are iPhones, surged 52% in April to 3.489 million units, according to CNN calculations based on data released Tuesday by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT). The academy is a research firm under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, a regulatory body. The increase is a major acceleration from the 12% growth logged in March by foreign-branded smartphones, according to previous data from CAICT. The Global Times, a state-owned tabloid known for its patriotic views and promoting Chinese companies, has described the rebound as \u201cimpressive.\u201d Apple (AAPL) had a tough start to 2024 in China. In the first quarter, it lost the top spot in the country\u2019s smartphone market as shipments tumbled 19%, according to a report by Counterpoint Research. Apple took a hit from growing competition with local brands including Huawei, which saw sales increase nearly 70% in the same period because of the successful launch of its Mate 60 series. An economic slump, including worsening job and income prospects, has prompted Chinese consumers to tighten their belts and seek discounts on everything from food to cars. But iPhone sales started to bounce back in March after Apple and its retail partners slashed prices, according to CAICT data. The price-cutting intensified recently. Last week, Apple said it would slash prices on some of its smartphones on Tmall, an Amazon-like site owned by Alibaba (BABA), by as much as 23% until May 28. Similar reductions were made on JD.com, another major e-commerce site. The unprecedented discounts were part of a campaign launched during the annual \u201c618\u201d shopping festival, China\u2019s second-biggest online shopping bonanza of the year, which usually runs from late May to mid-June. After the discounts, the iPhone 15 is now in the same price range as smartphones made by Xiaomi and Huawei. The hefty reductions are \u201cthe only way\u201d for Apple to defend its market share in China, Jefferies analysts said earlier this week. \u201cWe believe Apple has created significant pricing pressure on the local brands,\u201d especially Huawei\u2019s flagship models, they said. That will help Apple regain its lost market share but is also likely to put pressure on its competitors to cut prices further. \u201cThe discounts on high-end models could extend into the third quarter of 2024, pressuring all smartphone (makers\u2019) margins,\u201d they added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/tech/china-apple-sales-rebound-price-cuts-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

The company said the\u00a0Oreo\u00a0cookies and other chocolates produced at the Ukrainian factory are not being exported to neighboring Russia. Mondelez has three factories in Russia and sells its cookies and snacks there despite\u00a0boycotts\u00a0and calls for it to stop from\u00a0employees, activists and investors.

{"id": "2024_05_28_tech_ai-iphone", "text": "Imagine asking Apple\u2019s Siri to show you an old photo taken from a child\u2019s second birthday, or summarizing lengthy emails and writing drafts. Then consider Siri learning your schedule, preferences, even your personality, so it can better communicate with you throughout the day. Generative AI, artificial intelligence that can provide thoughtful and thorough responses to questions and prompts, could potentially breathe new life into Apple\u2019s iPhone lineup at a time when competitors are threatening to leave the company behind in the race to shape what could be a world-changing technology. The company is widely expected to partner with ChatGPT maker OpenAI ahead of its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June, where it will likely show off its first batch of AI tools coming to the iOS software. Although artificial intelligence has powered some of the iPhone\u2019s experiences for years, such as Live Text and improved autocorrect, generative AI could unlock new levels of interaction and personalization. All this during a time when the company is under pressure to catch up to rivals such as Google and Samsung, which are already using the technology in its smartphones. \u201cWe see generative AI as a key opportunity across our products and believe we have advantages that set us apart there,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the company\u2019s most recent earnings call in early May, noting there would be news announced in the \u201cweeks ahead.\u201d Apple is not always first to adopt to emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect them for years before including them in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the most cutting-edge technology. The debut of an AI iPhone could also entice consumers to upgrade at a time when they\u2019ve been holding onto older models longer. Apple reported first-quarter revenue of $90.8 billion, down 4% year over year, as the tech giant continues to struggle with growth challenges, particularly in China, amid an uncertain economic environment. Now all eyes shift to Apple for its take on generative AI. Here\u2019s how that could play out on the iPhone: A much smarter assissant Although it\u2019s unclear what exactly an iPhone in the generative AI world would look like, experts largely believe the biggest entrypoint is through Siri, the company\u2019s virtual assistant with a hit-or-miss track record. Integration with OpenAI\u2019s latest ChatGPT-4o model could catapult Siri years forward, essentially turning the feature into an iPhone chatbot. This would enable Siri to perform specific tasks such as recalling a picture taken years ago on the device or answering detailed questions about the weather, the news or trivia. Over time, it could learn the user\u2019s preferences and even personality, and respond accordingly. Looking at how competitors have already introduced generative tools, the iPhone will also likely assist users with other tasks, such as offering to summarize and draft emails, or starting an online purchase return process. Samsung\u2019s \u201ccircle to search\u201d feature, which allows users to quickly search for information on a device\u2019s screen with a finger gesture, has received a lot of attention and is featured in marketing campaigns. Multimodal features \u2013 which refers to an AI system that can interpret and generate different types of data, such as text and images at the same time \u2014 like analysis of video footage and in-call spam detection could also form part of the tools, according to Paul Schell, industry analyst at tech intelligence firm ABI Research. \u201cSomething similar would likely be included in an Apple offering, given its relative simplicity and appeal that goes beyond simple image search,\u201d Schell said. \u201cBut verbal interactions with a bot like Siri will be much more natural and fluent, and its capabilities will go far beyond the previous, narrow domains, like news and weather updates.\u201d An AI iPhone could also adapt automatically and seamlessly to users, based on voice, audio and natural language, along with images and contextual cues. \u201cGenerative AI will allow the next generations of iPhones to become a sixth sense, empowering us to scan and interact with the world around us,\u201d said Thomas Husson, an analyst with market research firm Forrester. Generative AI will also likely change Apple\u2019s whole ecosystem by embedding it through its own apps, such as Apple Maps, iMovie and iPhoto, and release tools for developers for brands to develop new experiences through their own apps. Expediting AI Behind the scenes, Apple reportedly has been working on its on-device generative AI capabilities and acquiring companies for awhile, such as Canadian startup DarwinAI. It also has a machine learning research division dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence.  But after the launch of ChatGPT ignited an AI arms race in late 2022, followed by companies such as Google, Microsoft and Meta heavily pouring resources into developing related tools, Apple has remained relatively quiet about its visions for an AI-powered future. Nabila Popal, a senior research director at market research firm IDC, said the pressure to be part of the conversation likely moved up the company\u2019s timeline. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported Apple was closing in on a deal with OpenAI to use its ChatGPT technology on iPhones, after holding similar talks with Google. \u201cApple normally takes their time and doesn\u2019t let the Android race rush [impact its moves], be it with foldables or 5G or even augmented and virtual reality,\u201d Popal said. \u201cAnd Apple then comes out and does it better than anyone else.\u201d \u201cHowever this time, with AI, it is different,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like Apple is being forced to show its hand early.\u201d She said consumers are considering AI capabilities of greater importance than any other feature when choosing their premium device, especially in China, where Apple is losing its marketshare. \u201cIt\u2019s not just because of the resurgence of Huawei but also because of \u2018lack of AI\u2019 in their devices,\u201d she said. \u201cChinese consumers want more from their premium phones.\u201d During its most recent iPad event, Apple reminded onlookers that it\u2019s been using artificial intelligence in its products for years, including a neural processing engine to support its A11 bionic chip. But now it needs to show it\u2019s going all in on artificial intelligence to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving industry. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a question about whether or not Apple will announce something around generative AI, but Apple has to if they want to achieve growth in this highly competitive and innovative smartphone market, especially in China. \u2026 AI is one train Apple can\u2019t afford to miss.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/tech/ai-iphone/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

The complaint alleges all three companies were responsible for employing the child. Hyundai owns a majority of SMART\u2019s parent company, according to the complaint.

Annual consumer price inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro rose to 2.6% in May from 2.4% in April, according to preliminary estimates published by the European Union\u2019s statistics office on Friday. That came in slightly above the 2.5% uptick expected by analysts polled by Reuters. The jump was driven by a rise in services inflation to 4.1% in May, up from 3.7% in April, and its highest level since October. Core inflation,\u00a0which strips out volatile products such as energy and food,\u00a0rose to 2.9% in May from 2.7% the month prior, the preliminary data showed. The European Central Bank began hiking rates in July 2022 to curb runaway inflation sparked by the reopening of the world\u2019s economies following the pandemic as well as Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It is still widely expected to start reducing the record cost of borrowing at its meeting on June 6, but Friday\u2019s numbers \u2014 which show inflation still tracking above the central bank\u2019s 2% target \u2014 has cast doubt among some analysts about what happens thereafter. \u201cMay\u2019s increases (in inflation) won\u2019t stop the ECB from cutting interest rates next week.

The Georgia man, Mark Andrews,\u00a0said in his 2022 lawsuit\u00a0that\u00a0\u201c2000 Mules,\u201d a film and book by far-right activist\u00a0Dinesh D\u2019Souza contained a string of bogus claims about the 2020 election, leading to\u00a0threats of violence against him and his family. Andrews said the film, which\u00a0has been repeatedly\u00a0promoted by Donald Trump and widely circulated in right-wing media as\u00a0supposed proof that the 2020 election was stolen,\u00a0had severely damaged his reputation. \u201cIt was never our intent that the publication of the 2000 Mules film and book would harm Mr. Andrews,\u201d Salem said in a\u00a0Friday statement. \u201cWe apologize for the hurt the inclusion of Mr. Andrews\u2019 image in the movie, book, and promotional materials have caused Mr. Andrews and his family.\u201d \u201cWe have removed the film from Salem\u2019s platforms, and there will be no future distribution of the film or the book by Salem,\u201d the right-wing company added. The apology from Salem came as part of a larger settlement to the lawsuit filed by Andrews. A representative for Protect Democracy, a nonprofit group that sued Salem on behalf of Andrews, did not comment on the terms of the settlement. Neither did a representative for Salem. Salem operates a national talk radio\u00a0network,\u00a0distributing the\u00a0programs\u00a0of several prominent pro-Trump personalities such as Charlie Kirk and Sebastian Gorka, to\u00a0more than 2,700 affiliates.\u00a0It also\u00a0owns dozens of Christian-format radio stations\u00a0and the right-wing political website\u00a0Townhall. In the \u201c2000 Mules\u201d film,\u00a0Andrews was featured\u00a0on video\u00a0with his face blurred\u00a0depositing\u00a0his ballot, along with those belonging to his family, into a drop box in what the film purported was a so-called \u201cmule\u201d operation. \u201cWhat you are seeing is a crime,\u201d a voiceover from D\u2019Souza\u00a0declared. \u201cThese are fraudulent votes.\u201d Salem said in its Friday statement that it \u201crelied on representations\u201d that D\u2019Souza\u00a0had\u00a0made. \u201cWe have learned that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation has cleared Mr. Andrews of illegal voting activity in connection with the event depicted in 2000 Mules,\u201d the company said. In the aftermath of the 2020 election, Trump\u2019s media allies promoted false claims that the election had been stolen by then-candidate Joe Biden. While the claims were false, polls have indicated that the lies were effective, convincing the majority of the Republican Party that Biden\u2019s election was illegitimate. Those election lies, however, have\u00a0led to legal consequences for outlets that promoted the claims,\u00a0with right-wing media companies\u00a0facing\u00a0a slew of costly lawsuits stemming from their coverage of the 2020 election.\u00a0Last month,\u00a0the pro-Trump network One America News\u00a0settled a lawsuit\u00a0brought by voting technology company Smartmatic over the outlet\u2019s promotion of lies about the 2020 election.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_business_cracker-barrel-relevant-early-bird", "text": "Cracker Barrel CEO Julie Felss Masino recently gave a devastatingly frank assessment of the brand: \u201cWe\u2019re just not as relevant as we once were.\u201d Masino, who became CEO in July, laid out the diagnosis \u2014 and the remedies \u2014 in a May presentation to analysts. And it raises questions for those accustomed to the brand\u2019s biscuits and gravy, wooden tables and chairs, brain puzzler games and front porch rocking chairs. \u201cThe way we communicate, the things on the menu, the way the stores look and feel \u2026 all of these things came up time and time again in our research as opportunities for us to really regain relevancy,\u201d she said. The revamped Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (the brand\u2019s full name) could include remodeled restaurants with bookcases instead of lattice dividers and brand new banquette seating. New Cracker Barrels might be smaller restaurants altogether, with menus that include new items like green chili cornbread and banana pudding. Customers may see brighter interiors with simpler decor, a move away from the typical cozy clutter. Those changes are still just being tested. One new thing happening now? Discounted dinner from 4 to 6 p.m. Why would Cracker Barrel, so desperate for relevancy, lean into a tactic typically used to attract senior citizens? Partially because many people are eating early these days. And partially because it\u2019s looking for a quick fix. We\u2019re all early birds now Cracker Barrel, which first opened in 1969, has long billed itself as a roadside place where weary travelers can stop for a hearty meal in a homey dining room, and also pick from a large selection of knick knacks at its country store. That pitch, which has in the past largely appealed to Baby Boomers, hasn\u2019t resonated very well since the pandemic. Last year, when other diners returned to restaurants after the early pandemic years, Cracker Barrel\u2019s older clientele remained cautious, visiting the chain less often. Now, its retail stores are taking a hit as consumers pull back on spending. Those same dynamics are playing out in its restaurants. In the three months ended on April 26, Cracker Barrel\u2019s total revenue fell 1.9% compared to the year before, the company reported Thursday. Retail sales at stores open at least 18 months fell 3.8%, while restaurant sales fell 1.5%. Wall Street has not been impressed: The company\u2019s stock has declined nearly 37% this year, and has plunged about 70% over the past five years. The Tennessee-based chain owns its roughly 660 locations, which can be found throughout the country. These new early-bird deals, which launched in February, are available Monday through Friday from 4 to 6 pm. They start at $8.99 and include reduced portions of Cracker Barrel\u2019s signature country comfort food, like meatloaf and chicken.  Masino didn\u2019t explicitly mention the specials during the discussion about the long-term strategy for Cracker Barrel. But she did point to the offering during the company\u2019s earnings call on Thursday. It \u201cis a big piece of our overall pricing strategy,\u201d Masino said. In some ways, an early bird special is a perfect solution \u2014\u00a0it may appeal to both Covid-cautious seniors on a budget and younger consumers who are eating earlier. \u201cSix o\u2019clock is the new eight o\u2019clock,\u201d said Lisa W. Miller, a consumer strategist who has consulted for large restaurant chains through her company, Lisa W. Miller & Associates. \u201cThat four to six time period \u2026 can attract a younger family, as well.\u201d The Wall Street Journal declared over the summer that \u201cAmerica is becoming a nation of early birds.\u201d And in recent years, late night dining options have dwindled. Fewer people visited Cracker Barrel before 9 AM and after 6 PM in the first quarter this year compared to that period in 2019, according to data from Placer.ai, which uses location data from mobile devices to estimate visits to specific restaurants and retail locations. Instead, the chain has \u201cseen an increase in late morning and lunch visits,\u201d said RJ Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai. It\u2019s also seen an increase in the late afternoon, but a smaller one. The discrepancy \u201cmay explain the emphasis on early-bird specials,\u201d he said. Enticing younger consumers during that earlier period will depend somewhat on how the company advertises the deal, noted Miller. \u201cIt\u2019s all going to depend \u2026 on the creative executions \u2014 how are they going after it?\u201d Masino said Thursday that Cracker Barrel was so eager to rush out the promotion that it only recently started advertising the special. But breaking the association between early dinners and senior citizens will be hard, said John A. Gordon, founder and CEO of Pacific Management Consulting Group, a restaurant consultancy. \u201cIt\u2019s so well known in this country that seniors go out to eat earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough that\u2019s changing \u2026 it is  burned into people\u2019s psyche, that that is designated for seniors.\u201d Deals, deals, deals The company expects it to take years to revamp its brand, operations and restaurant models. But it needs to start improving sales sooner. And right now, consumers want deals. Fast food companies are once again battling over dollars and cents, with many rolling out $5 bundles. Casual dining restaurants like Chili\u2019s and Applebee\u2019s are vying for customers with their own specials.

{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

In a\u00a0blog post, OpenAI said the new committee would be led by CEO Sam Altman as well as Bret Taylor, the company\u2019s board chair, and board member Nicole Seligman. The announcement follows\u00a0the high-profile exit\u00a0this month of an OpenAI executive focused on safety, Jan Leike. Leike resigned from OpenAI leveling criticisms that the company had underinvested in AI safety work and that tensions with OpenAI\u2019s leadership had \u201creached a breaking point.\u201d It also comes after the departure of Ilya Sutskever, another leader of OpenAI\u2019s so-called \u201csuperalignment\u201d team focused on ensuring that AI development serves human needs and priorities. Sutskever played a key role in Altman\u2019s\u00a0surprise ouster\u00a0as CEO last year, only to reverse course and later throw his support behind Altman\u2019s return. Earlier this month, an OpenAI spokesperson told CNN that dismantling the superalignment team and reassigning those employees across the company would help it better achieve its superalignment goals.

{"id": "2024_05_31_tech_fcc-affordable-connectivity-program-acp-close", "text": "The Affordable Connectivity Program, which helped low-income Americans get online, is no more. On Friday, the US government announced the final closure of the broadly popular federal program, which has helped tens of millions of households afford internet service, after Republicans in Congress ignored calls by consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers to approve more funding this spring. The program\u2019s lapse threatens to throw nearly 60 million Americans into financial distress,\u00a0CNN has reported. The program officially ends on June 1, said the Federal Communications Commission, which administered the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) to approximately 1 in 5 households\u00a0across the country and\u00a0on tribal reservations. The 2.5-year-old ACP provided eligible low-income Americans with a monthly credit off their internet bills, worth up to $30 per month and as much as $75 per month for households on tribal lands. The pandemic-era program was a hit with members of both political parties and served tens of millions of seniors, veterans and rural and urban Americans alike. Program participants received\u00a0only partial benefits\u00a0in May ahead of the ACP\u2019s expected collapse. \u201cThe Affordable Connectivity Program filled an important gap that provider low-income programs, state and local affordability programs, and the Lifeline program cannot fully address,\u201d said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel in a statement, referring to the name of another, similar FCC program that subsidizes wireless and home internet service. \u201cThe Commission is available to provide any assistance Congress may need to support funding the ACP in the future and stands ready to resume the program if additional funding is provided.\u201d Some US lawmakers proposed bipartisan legislation to extend the ACP in the months leading up to the deadline. But the bills languished in the face of inaction by Republican leaders who showed little interest in engaging with the issue. President Joe Biden and Democratic lawmakers have\u00a0publicly blamed\u00a0GOP leadership for allowing the ACP to end. A spokesperson for House Speaker Mike Johnson didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. On Friday, Biden reiterated his calls for Congress to pass legislation extending the ACP. He also announced a series of voluntary commitments by a handful of internet providers to offer \u2014 or continue offering \u2014 their own proprietary low-income internet plans.The list includes AT&T, Comcast, Cox, Charter\u2019s Spectrum and Verizon, among others. Those providers will continue to offer qualifying ACP households a broadband plan for $30 or less, the White House said, and together the companies are expected to cover roughly 10 million of the 23 million households relying on the ACP. The ACP was initially funded by Congress with a one-time budget of $14 billion. Biden has asked for $6 billion to continue the program and one bipartisan bill proposed renewing the ACP with $7 billion in additional funding. Kathryn de Wit, director of the Pew Charitable Trust\u2019s broadband access initiative, said reaching the deadline without a solution from Congress was a \u201cdisheartening\u201d outcome. \u201cWithout intervention, households participating in the program will immediately see their internet bills go up,\u201d de Wit said. \u201cWe know cost is a key barrier to connecting low-income families to the internet, so without ACP we can expect most participating households to either downgrade or drop their plans altogether.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/tech/fcc-affordable-connectivity-program-acp-close/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

It was Millerchip\u2019s first earnings call with analysts since taking over for Richard Galanti, Costco\u2019s colorful finance chief of nearly four decades and the longest-serving CFO of a major US public company. With Costco\u2019s leadership change \u2014 and other longtime deals like Trader Joe\u2019s 19-cent bananas and Planet Fitness\u2019 $10 membership ending amid rising inflation \u2014 some had speculated about the future of Costco\u2019s $1.50 hot dog. The price has remained the same since 1985. If Costco\u2019s hot dog deal kept pace with inflation, it would be three times as expensive today \u2014 nearly $4.50. But Costco\u2019s $1.50 combo is a strategic decision, known as a loss-leader: The company is willing to lose money selling the hot dogs at that price as long as it helps Costco draw in and retain customers. It\u2019d be an odd time to raise prices, anyway. Other companies, such as Walmart and Target, have been cutting prices on thousands of items to draw in shoppers who are increasingly fed up with rising costs. The $1.50 hot dog is a powerful marketing tool for Costco and is synonymous with Costco\u2019s brand. \u201cI know it sounds crazy making a big deal about a hot dog, but we spend a lot of time on it,\u201d Costco co-founder Jim Sinegal told the\u00a0Seattle Times\u00a0in 2009. \u201cWe\u2019re known for that hot dog.

Figure it out,\u201d according to former CEO Craig Jelinek. Costco offsets hot dog losses by increasing prices of pizzas and other items at its food courts and cutting costs. It also recently added chocolate chip cookies to its food court menu. The $2.49 double chocolate chunk cookie has been a \u201ccontinued success,\u201d Millerchip said Thursday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/food/costco-hot-dog-price/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing.

{"id": "2024_05_29_media_buzzfeed-vivek-ramaswamy-trolling", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Vivek Ramaswamy\u00a0is waging an expensive trolling campaign on\u00a0BuzzFeed Former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy \u2014 who has an extensive history promoting lies and conspiracy theories, including around the January 6 insurrection, the Sept. 11 attacks, and legitimacy of the 2020 vote \u2014 outlined his plan on Tuesday to revive the once high-flying progressive media company, which he disclosed earlier this month he had taken an activist stake in. In a letter to BuzzFeed\u2019s board, a copy of which Ramaswamy posted online, the MAGA hardliner and former Republican presidential candidate recommended laying off large swaths of the company\u2019s existing staff. He encouraged BuzzFeed\u2019s board to transform the outlet into a creator-driven platform, suggesting it hire personalities akin to fellow radicals\u00a0Candace Owens\u00a0and\u00a0Tucker Carlson. He requested that the board add three unnamed directors to its ranks to increase \u201cdiversity of thought.\u201d And, finally, Ramaswamy implored BuzzFeed to issue a public apology to the country for having supposedly lied about\u00a0Donald Trump, Covid-19 and various other issues. \u201cAddress your audience directly and candidly admit: We failed in our obligation to tell you the truth,\u201d Ramaswamy encouraged BuzzFeed. \u201cBy both omission and commission, we repeatedly lied on issues of national importance, and so did the rest of the media.\u201d Needless to say, Ramaswamy\u2019s proposal is not a serious one. He obviously knows that BuzzFeed is not going be issuing any apologies for supposedly lying to the public. And it goes without saying that BuzzFeed co-founder and boss\u00a0Jonah Peretti\u00a0is not going to adopt a business plan that would deform his company and remold it into a\u00a0Rumble-like platform that would disseminate MAGA disinformation for profit. \u201cWhat few business ideas he presents in his letter are distinctly un-original and reflects media truisms and conventional platitudes, none of which could possibly be new to BuzzFeed or any experienced media leaders,\u201d\u00a0Jeffrey A Sonnenfeld, the renowned professor and senior associate dean for leadership studies at the\u00a0Yale School of Management, told me Tuesday. \u201cHe praises his three nominees for the board and pressures BuzzFeed into accepting them without publicly identifying who they are and whether they are qualified beyond their loyalty to Vivek. He is, in short, trying to hijack BuzzFeed and turn it into a pliable Vivek Ramaswamy in-house news organ \u2014 VivekNews so to speak.\u201d While BuzzFeed was once the upstart darling of the digital media era, soaring with massive audience scale on the back of social media referrals and quirky quizzes, changes to\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and other platforms\u2019 algorithms took the wind out of the outlet\u2019s sails. Since BuzzFeed went public in 2021 via a SPAC, shares in the company have plunged 92%, trading at $3 on Tuesday. Though the company has fallen on hard times, most notably shuttering its award-winning news division and selling off\u00a0Complex, it continues to operate\u00a0The Huffington Post,\u00a0Tasty,\u00a0First We Feast\u00a0and other major internet brands. Peretti, in his emailed response to Ramaswamy, was more cordial than Sonnenfeld. But it was apparent that he does not view the right-wing entrepreneur\u2019s ideas for the future of BuzzFeed as compelling. \u201cBased on your letter, you have some fundamental misunderstandings about the drivers of our business, the values of our audience, and the mission of the company,\u201d Peretti wrote. \u201cI\u2019m very skeptical it makes business sense to turn BuzzFeed into a creator platform for inflammatory political pundits. And we\u2019re definitely not going to issue an apology for our\u00a0Pulitzer Prize-winning journalism.\u201d Peretti said he does \u201cwelcome outside perspectives from shareholders\u201d and would meet with Ramaswamy. Though in doing so, Peretti made it clear Ramaswamy does not call the shots at the company and would have to consult with Peretti\u2019s executive assistant to \u201cschedule a time to meet.\u201d Indeed, while Ramaswamy disclosed that he has taken an 8.3% stake in BuzzFeed\u2019s class A shares, a position he said he continues to increase, he has little actual power over the direction of the company. That is because Peretti owns 96% of class B shares, which each come with 50 votes compared to the single vote a class A share offers. As it currently stands, Peretti has 64% voting power compared to Ramaswamy\u2019s paltry 2.6%. In other words, Peretti remains \u2014\u00a0by far\u00a0\u2014 the actual boss at BuzzFeed. Ramaswamy\u2019s antics might generate noise, but that\u2019s all it ultimately is. So what does Ramaswamy really want from this affair? Occam\u2019s razor would suggest the noise and attention it brings, which has been the apparent motivating factor behind the various moves he has made in recent years, including running for president. As Sonnenfeld derived from his letter, Ramaswamy\u2019s proposal \u201coozes with self-promotion and seemingly reflects an ideological crusade much more than a serious business turnaround plan.\u201d Asked how Peretti and the BuzzFeed board should address Ramaswamy\u2019s activist stake, Sonnenfeld was not subtle: \u201cRamaswamy has little credibility amongst the investors who comprise BuzzFeed\u2019s shareholder base, less credibility with their subscribers, and BuzzFeed\u2019s board should not allow him to hijack the company with such a minor stake and turn BuzzFeed into the Vivek Ramaswamy in-house news organ.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/media/buzzfeed-vivek-ramaswamy-trolling/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_cars_hybrid-porsche-911-revealed", "text": "Porsche unveiled the first hybrid version of its most famous sports car, the 911, on Tuesday, a move that could help electric motors become more accepted even in performance cars. The move also marks a major step in the evolution of one of the most recognizable cars in the world. Given their generally greater fuel efficiency without the sacrifice of power, hybrids have become commonplace in many types of vehicles. They have become increasingly popular in the United States even as sales of purely electric models have started to slow. The German automaker Porsche, a division of Volkswagen AG, already sells plug-in hybrid models like the Cayenne e-Hybrid SUV and Panamera e-Hybrid four-door car, but a hybrid 911 is another matter. Initially, hybrid power will be available in only one version of the car, the high performance 911 Carrera GTS. With an electric motor integrated into the car\u2019s eight-speed transmission assisting the car\u2019s six-cylinder gas engine, the new 911 model will produce up to 532 horsepower, 59 more than the current Carrera GTS model. Few cars are as defined by a gasoline engine as the 911, and few automakers are as defined by one model as Porsche is by the 911. While Porsche sells far more SUVs than sports cars these days, the 911 remains the automaker\u2019s\u00a0core model.\u00a0Even the Porsche Macan and Cayenne SUVs, with their rounded edges and sloped hoods, have nods in their designs to the 911. In another major change for Porsche, this car will not be a plug-in hybrid, as other Porsche hybrid models have been. The Porsche Cayenne e-Hybrid and Panamera e-Hybrid are plug-in hybrids with batteries that can be charged from an EV charger as well as by the vehicles\u2019 own engine. Those models can also drive some distance on only electric power after the battery has been fully charged. The 911 Carrera GTS will be a fully self-contained hybrid, charged only by power from the engine and from braking. It will not be able to drive significant distances on electric power alone. Besides hybrids, Porsche also sells fully electric cars, the Taycan and the new Macan Electric SUV. But executives have said the\u00a0911 would be the last Porsche to become all-electric, because its engineering is so unique and quintessential to its brand. By taking away the engine in the back, which gave the car the distinctive shape and rear-weighted driving feel, what makes it a 911? This new hybrid model, which still has its gas engine mounted in the back, will be the closest Porsche can get to an electric 911 without raising those sorts of questions. Although electric vehicle sales in the US continue to rise, the rate of growth has slowed sharply in recent months. Meanwhile, sales of hybrids are growing faster. Blame for slowing EV sales has been placed on relatively high prices of the models currently for sale and a lack of reliable public EV chargers. Hybrids are generally cheaper and don\u2019t require a charger. This particular hybrid will not be cheap, though. Prices for the 2025 Porsche 911 Carrera GTS will start at around $165,000. A Porsche test driver drove the hybrid around Germany\u2019s famed\u00a0N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife racetrack in 7 minutes and 17 seconds \u2014 8.7 seconds faster than a comparable current-generation 911 Carrra GTS. The N\u00fcrburgring is a twisty, challenging track, so the faster time also indicates the car\u2019s handling isn\u2019t hindered by the added weight of batteries and electric motors. The unveiling of the new hybrid version comes about 60 years after Porsche launched the 911. The first 911 was unveiled in 1963 but didn\u2019t go into production until 1964. It was a larger and more powerful addition to Porsche\u2019s original model \u2014 the 356. Both models, which were produced together for only a few years, had small back seats and engines mounted behind the rear wheels. The layout was similar to the\u00a0Volkswagen Beetle, a car designed by Ferdinand Porsche Sr., the father of Ferdinand \u201cFerry\u201d Porsche, who created the 356. Ferry\u2019s son, Ferdinand \u201cButzi\u201d Porsche, worked on the design of the 911, modeled after the 356\u2019s teardrop shape. Its form, including the increasingly cramped back seats, has remained fundamentally the same since the original model.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/cars/hybrid-porsche-911-revealed/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength.

A classic refrain is \u201cWe can tell you really want to change the world, but we\u2019ve gone for more qualified candidates,\u201d she said. \u201cThey always add an environmental quip.\u201d After applying to over 100 jobs at environmental consulting firms, law firms, nonprofit organizations and think tanks since last fall, Savidge hasn\u2019t received a single full-time offer. But she is relieved to have at least secured a summer internship at an environmental science publication. On paper, the job market looks like it\u2019s hardly ever been better. The unemployment rate has stayed under 4% for more than two years, the longest stretch of time since the early 1960s. And there are more than 8 million jobs, which exceeds the number of openings before the pandemic. But zooming in on the job market for recent college graduates paints the economy in a much less rosy light. The unemployment rate for bachelor\u2019s degree recipients aged 20 to 29 is above 12%, an almost four percentage point increase from a year ago, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. That essentially means applicants like Savidge are competing with more people for the same position compared to a year, said Kory Kantenga, LinkedIn\u2019s head of economics for the Americas. \u201cWhile securing that first job tends to be challenging, it is especially hard now given the slowdown in the labor market over the last two years,\u201d he said. Kantenga sees the job market for college grads as \u201can acute barometer for the temperature of the overall market for workers with college degrees.\u201d When college grads are having more difficulty getting jobs compared to prior years, that could signal there\u2019s a greater slowdown happening in the economy. Since employers tend to value workers with more experience, college grads could be getting passed over by people who were laid off from prior jobs, he said. \u2018What are you going to do for your job search today?\u2019 Angela Mangione said she receives a text almost every day from her father saying something like, \u201cGood morning! What are you gonna do for your job search today?\u201d Mangione, who graduated from Colgate University with a major in international relations, said many of her classmates have already signed leases for new places for jobs they\u2019re about to start. But she\u2019s living back home in Buffalo, New York, doing just about everything she can to get a job. \u201cI just don\u2019t hear back [from jobs] until months later when I\u2019ve basically forgotten about it telling me I was rejected,\u201d she told CNN. Initially, she applied for jobs in management consulting but said a lot of positions have been frozen amid an industry-wide hiring slowdown. She\u2019s now focusing her efforts on campaign jobs, particularly on the Biden campaign, and having more conversations with alumni to continue to build her network. A bit of luck goes a long way Although Moises Brito had a high GPA and led Chapman University\u2019s Accounting Society chapter, among other extracurricular activities, he\u2019s not discounting the role luck played in his career. The internship he got with Deloitte two summers ago came through a cold apply. Not long after he applied, a Deloitte recruiter happened to show up at an Accounting Society networking event. \u201cI assume that he really enjoyed talking to me because I got an interview shortly after,\u201d said Brito, who double majored in business administration and accounting. Originally he was offered the internship for the summer of 2023. But because of a change of plans, a recruiter offered him the position a year earlier, going into his junior year. The next summer he returned to Deloitte for another internship, and at the end was offered a full-time position in the audit department. That position, however, doesn\u2019t start until September. To cover his expenses until then, he applied for summer internships at other accounting firms in Orange County, California, where he is based. But he encountered what Savidge and\u00a0Mangione have been experiencing: lots and lots of ghosting. In the end, luck struck again and he managed to secure a six-week internship at a local firm.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/economy/job-market-for-college-grads/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_business_fast-food-deals-back-mcdonalds", "text": "For years, restaurant executives had a confident message for investors: We\u2019re raising prices, and customers don\u2019t care. Well, now diners do \u2014\u00a0and fast food chains, especially, are rapidly changing course. Frustrated diners are complaining online about how expensive fast food has become. Low-income consumers in particular are dining out less often, and spending less when they do. For some fast food restaurants, that means slowing sales and less foot traffic. To win people back, these chains are returning to a strategy they tried to leave behind: Discounts. KFC recently introduced a value menu with meals starting at $4.99. Burger King is bringing back a $5 meal. Even McDonald\u2019s, which had been adept at raising prices without losing sales, is asking its franchise operators to embrace a $5 meal. Taco Bell, Jack in the Box, Wendy\u2019s and others have been highlighting their own budget items in recent months, and adding more. Restaurant chains in recent years have highlighted their value, making the case to customers that they\u2019re getting a deal, even when prices go up. But it\u2019s been a long time since they used discounted meals as a strategy to drive traffic, noted Peter Saleh, restaurant analyst at BTIG. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had discounting, or promotions, really since pre-pandemic,\u201d he said, marking \u201cthe longest period, I think, we\u2019ve ever gone \u2026 without this type of level of promotions.\u201d Price promotions are a gamble (or, as one analyst described them during a recent Wendy\u2019s earnings call, akin to \u201ca street fight.\u201d) Discounts eat into margins, and are only effective if they significantly boost customer traffic. That\u2019s not so easy to do, especially when competitors are also dropping prices and vying for a shrinking customer base. \u201cThere is a battle to try and hang on to market share,\u201d Saleh said. So, restaurants are going all in on deals \u2014 for now. A business imperative During an April 30 analyst call, McDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski laid out the stakes for the burger chain: \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that we continue to keep affordability at the forefront for our customers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe literally wrote the playbook on value, and we are committed to upholding our leadership within the industry.\u201d However, McDonald\u2019s had already fallen behind. Wendy\u2019s, which has a $5 menu, has been periodically offering $3 breakfast deals since at least last year. KFC launched its value menu earlier that month. Burger King\u2019s franchisees had in April already agreed to bring back the chain\u2019s $5 Your Way Meal, though it is not yet available. Kempczinski told analysts that while competitors had nationwide meal bundles, McDonald\u2019s did not. \u201cThe opportunity for us in the US, I think, is to get more aligned as a system around a strong national value proposition,\u201d he said. A few weeks after that call, The Wall Street Journal reported that McDonald\u2019s was planning to run a $5 meal promotion for about a month starting at the end of June. A May statement from the National Owners Association, a group for McDonald\u2019s franchise operators, indicated that operators were deciding whether to adopt the promotion, which would include chicken nuggets, fries, a soft drink and either a McDouble hamburger or McChicken sandwich for $5. An NOA representative declined this week to comment on the status of the vote. A tipping point Restaurants are being careful to limit their promotions to a set period of time \u2014\u00a0nobody wants an endless-shrimp-style debacle. But even so, the price wars could get ugly. \u201cWe believe this represents a tipping point in the [quick service restaurant] industry\u2019s intensified push on value that we worry will extend beyond the promotion\u2019s scheduled run as competitors look to protect share,\u201d Cowen analyst Andrew Charles wrote in a note, referencing the McDonald\u2019s deal. Indeed, Burger King is rushing out its meal deal before McDonald\u2019s, according to Bloomberg. Burger King\u2019s $5 meal will include a sandwich plus nuggets, fries and a drink, and the promotion will last for several months, Bloomberg reported. A Burger King spokesperson confirmed to CNN that it plans to offer a $5 meal, without sharing more details. The move by McDonald\u2019s \u201creminds us of McDonald\u2019s 2018 experience when a national value menu was last the center of attention,\u201d Charles added in his note. That year, McDonald\u2019s launched a revamped version of its dollar menu, with $1, $2 and $3 items. That offering \u201cwas not successful,\u201d in boosting traffic or grabbing market share, he said. A race to the bottom is \u201calways the danger,\u201d when it comes to cutting prices, said David Henkes, a senior principal at Technomic, a food industry research and consulting firm. \u201cMargin and profitability is going to be the challenge for 2024,\u201d he added. \u201cThese value meals in the short term are only going to exacerbate that.\u201d So, executives are proceeding with caution. Burger King \u201cwant[s] to avoid some of the deeper discounting\u201d that took place in the past, said Josh Kobza, CEO of Burger King parent company Restaurant Brands International, during an April analyst call. Companies can limit the financial impact of these deals by letting them expire after a few months, Henkes said. They can also make them available through digital channels, which at least give restaurants valuable data about their customers. And more deals don\u2019t mean that menu prices are dropping, or even staying the same.\u201cI think we\u2019re back to an environment of more normal price increases,\u201d of roughly 2-3% said BTIG\u2019s Saleh. \u201cThe actual menu price will not be coming down.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/business/fast-food-deals-back-mcdonalds/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens.

Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_success_buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage", "text": "Moving somewhere new when you retire isn\u2019t uncommon. But deciding whether to take out a new mortgage to buy a home is a big deal. Much of your financial life is changing as you transition from a steady paycheck to a mix of fixed and variable income and a new lifestyle. So adding a large debt to the picture isn\u2019t an easy call. That\u2019s especially true now that mortgage rates hover around 7% and home prices keep rising. \u201cAny time you take on debt, you increase risk in your situation,\u201d said Illinois-based certified financial planner Jim Stork. More than a third (35%) of homebuyers last year were between the ages of 59 and 98, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Within that group, a majority financed their purchases. Whether taking out a new mortgage makes sense for you depends on a lot of factors, including how to prove to a lender that you\u2019re a good credit risk, plus your feelings about the debt and the ongoing cost of maintaining a home. To get a mortgage, your age won\u2019t be a factor, but your income will be If you\u2019re concerned that you may be less attractive to a mortgage banker because you\u2019ve hit retirement age, know that it is illegal to discriminate against anyone applying for a mortgage based on their age. Lenders\u2019 chief focus will be on your ability to repay your mortgage with your various sources of non-paycheck income. \u201cWhen you qualify for a mortgage, it\u2019s all based on your income,\u201d said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage. That, and of course any debt you have that will soak up your income, but we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. The income sources that lenders consider, absent a regular paycheck, include: Social Security benefits, pension or annuity income, spousal benefits, disability payments, interest and dividends and your 401(k) or IRA. If a portion of your income is not subject to tax, the lender may treat it as worth 25% more. Fannie Mae offers this example: Say 15% of a $1,500 monthly Social Security benefit is tax free. That means $225 of it will not be subject to tax ($1,500 x 15%). And 25% of that amount comes to $56 ($225 x 25%). So that $56 can be added to a person\u2019s qualifying Social Security income amount ($1,500 + $56 = $1,556). If you want to use your nest egg, different methods can be used to calculate how much income it would provide. There is the asset depletion method in which your eligible assets are divided by your loan term. In the case of a 30-year mortgage, that would be 360 months. If your IRA is worth $700,000, that translates into $1,944 per month ($700,000/360). \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to take the money out \u2014 but you can use your assets [to qualify for a mortgage] as if you were going to take the distribution,\u201d Cohn said. Another option: If you are at least 59-1/2, you can start taking monthly distributions from an IRA without penalty \u2014 or a 401(k) if your plan rules permit \u2014 and the lender will count that as income so long as you show that you have sufficient funds in the account to keep taking that same monthly distribution for three years. Once you close on your home, Cohn said, you can reduce or stop taking distributions if you choose. That assumes you are not yet in your 70s when the IRS requires you to start taking minimum distributions, said Mark Luscombe, a principal analyst at Wolters, Kluwer Tax & Accounting. Burdened by debt? Lenders will also assess your debt-to-income ratio, because no matter how much income you have, the big question is how much of it will be consumed by your debts. The debt portion is composed of your expected mortgage payment plus any credit card, student loan, car loan or other outstanding debt you may have. Generally speaking, for conventional loans your DTI ratio can be up to 50%, Cohen said. That ratio falls to between 43% and 45% if you\u2019re taking out a jumbo loan, she added. A jumbo loan exceeds the conforming loan limits in the area you want to buy. But ideally your debt level will fall well below these top limits, both for the lender\u2019s sake and yours. And, of course, the higher your credit score, the better the interest rate you can get on a mortgage. What you should consider before taking out a mortgage Even before seeking a mortgage, get a good grasp on your expected monthly income and expenses in retirement. Compared to pre-retirement earnings, \u201cMost (new retirees) see a decrease in income,\u201d said certified financial planner Lori Trawinski, director of finance and employment at AARP. While some expenses may also decline \u2014 e.g., work-related costs like commuting \u2014 others may increase over time, Trawinski said, like medical costs, property taxes, home insurance and utilities. Of course, you can downsize and move to a lower-cost area. But if you stay near where you lived during your career, your expenses are likely to rise over time. Also, Trawinski noted, if you\u2019re married, consider what will happen to your household income when one spouse dies. This will help you assess your future comfort level in carrying a mortgage. \u201cPeople often fail to plan for the death of a spouse. You can take a big hit to your income when that happens,\u201d she said. If you do move to a new state or region, weigh renting first. You can get a better sense of the cost of living in the area and decide whether it\u2019s a good fit for you. As Stork put it, \u201cFlorida in August is not as fun as Florida in January.\u201d How much are you really willing to take on? All the usual financial decisions that go into homebuying apply no matter your age. But, in retirement especially, you don\u2019t want to take on more debt than necessary, since the cost of a mortgage is fixed, but the returns on your investments, the housing market and your health needs are variable. At the very least, Stork said, consider whether you can put enough money down \u2014 at least 20% \u2014 to avoid having to pay private mortgage insurance. Beyond that, consider whether you feel comfortable keeping up \u2014 and paying for \u2014 maintenance on a home. Maintenance might amount to 2% a year of your home\u2019s value, Stork said. That amounts to $10,000 a year on a $500,000 home. Maintenance is essential in preserving the value of your house should you ever decide to sell. How would your mortgage interest rate compare to a reasonable rate of return on your investments? The decision to get a mortgage was a lot easier for retirees when rates were historically low \u2014 roughly 3% \u2014 and their nest eggs were earning a lot more. \u201cBut at today\u2019s rates it\u2019s a much harder calculation,\u201d Stork said. This is especially the case if you\u2019re a very conservative investor. \u201cIf your CDs are earning 4% and a mortgage would cost you 7%, you will lose money every day on that decision,\u201d Stork explained. To get the truest reading on what makes financial sense, compare mortgage expenses to your investment returns on an after-tax basis, Stork noted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/success/buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
