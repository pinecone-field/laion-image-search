{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "business_retailers-crackdown-organized-crime-invs", "text": "When SWAT officers swarmed a house in a sleepy San Jose, California neighborhood last month, they found what could best be described as a make-shift hardware store inside: Shelves lined with boxes of brand-new tools, bathroom fixtures and spools of industrial wiring. It resembled a mini Home Depot. And in some ways, it was. Much of the cache of products\u2014worth about $150,000\u2014had been stolen from real Home Depot stores.\u00a0The retail chain\u2019s internal security force spent months investigating the thefts, scanning security camera footage, tracking license plates and surveilling suspects. They connected dots of the criminal network allegedly responsible and shared their findings with the Santa Clara County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which executed search warrants and arrested the suspects. Increasingly, this is how it goes today for retailers trying to battle theft and fraud by organized crime rings. A CNN review of court records and interviews with more than two dozen retail and law enforcement officials shows that persistent problems with sophisticated organized crime networks have led many private-sector companies to not only assist law enforcement but to often deliver the bulk of the evidence that leads to criminal prosecutions. Anyone who has shopped at retail stores in recent years has encountered everyday products like laundry detergent, medication and beauty supplies locked up behind metal gates or plexiglass. Retailers say those in-store security measures are emblematic of the ongoing threat of organized retail crime, which typically involves groups of low-level thieves who steal items for middlemen who in turn sell to unsuspecting customers hunting for deals on marketplaces such as Amazon or eBay. Efforts to counter this crime, however, have come with some costs. Security investments can translate into higher prices for consumers, and civil liberties advocates argue the surveillance technology used by retailers can infringe on individuals\u2019 privacy. While retailers have long partnered with law enforcement, the industry has bolstered its role in recent years, devoting more staff and financial resources to thwarting theft. Some retailers are researching body-worn cameras for employees. Others, including Home Depot, have invested in police-like investigation centers to sift through data and pinpoint theft-group members. \u201cA lot of times, local and state resources don\u2019t have the capacity to investigate these crimes at that scale,\u201d said Sean Browne, senior manager of asset protection for Home Depot. Browne said Home Depot, which has nearly tripled its investigative team since 2016,  has started using license-plate readers in some store parking lots. \u201cWe try to full-service the investigations and ensure we cut off the head of the snake.\u201d Where law enforcement agencies sometimes face jurisdictional limits to their investigations, retailers can track cases across state and county lines with increasingly sophisticated tools \u2013 such as artificial intelligence that identifies patterns \u2013 and choose agencies with which to share cases. \u201cRetailers themselves are really taking the ball and running with it and then partnering with law enforcement at all levels,\u201d said David Johnston, vice president of asset protection for the National Retail Federation (NRF), a top lobbying group for the retail industry. NRF surveys of retailers\u00a0last year found that more than half reported budget increases to combat organized retail crime. Precise national data on organized retail crime is lacking. Last year, NRF even retracted a claim in one of its reports related to the scale of the crime, which led critics to charge that the industry had exaggerated the issue to achieve policy goals or justify store closures caused by underperformance. Still, most retailers insist they have seen an uptick in organized theft. About 90% of asset-protection professionals surveyed last year by NRF said the crime had become more of a risk over the prior three years. \u201cThese investments wouldn\u2019t be made for no reason,\u201d said Browne of Home Depot, which has also added security to stores like locks, gates, cameras and other tech to deter theft. \u201cUnfortunately, this creates an environment for our customers that isn\u2019t very friendly,\u201d he said. A complex crime The industry\u2019s push to crack down on organized retail crime comes amidst differing policies and law enforcement priorities across the nation. Some states have focused on tackling such theft, with more than a dozen launching organized retail crime taskforces, which collaborate with private companies and police. Investigators for the attorney general of Washington state, which created an organized retail crime unit last year, specifically credited businesses Target and Ulta Beauty for gathering much of the evidence\u00a0behind two felony cases, according to probable-cause affidavits. That material included loss prevention reports, security footage and photographs. In the case involving Ulta Beauty, a company investigator identified the defendant and accomplices who\u00a0allegedly stole products across six counties, according to an affidavit. \u201cWe can\u2019t bring the cases without them,\u201d Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said when asked by CNN about the role of retailers. \u201cEverything you\u2019re seeing in those probable-cause statements is what you would see in case after case after case as we go forward with this work.\u201d Ferguson said organized retail crime cases are inherently complex to investigate and prosecute, especially for local agencies with limited resources, so public-private partnerships are a necessity. That was evident in the case of Linda Ann Been, an Oklahoma woman sentenced to more than five years in prison earlier this month for managing an organized theft ring that federal prosecutors say stole about $9 million in property from retailers. The case largely began with an investigator for CVS\u00a0who noticed a trend of thefts at his company\u2019s stores in the Tulsa area, according to a state affidavit. He then used records to link low-level thieves who physically robbed the stores with Been and shared his findings with a local detective. The investigation later revealed how Been had provided the thieves with lists of items to steal from businesses across multiple states. The items were organized at a warehouse and boutique clothing shop in a suburb of Tulsa and sold by Been to other sellers \u2013 known as \u201cfences\u201d \u2013 outside of Oklahoma who in turn sold the products through websites, including eBay and Amazon, to customers, documents show. In a brief interview with CNN prior to her sentencing, Been questioned why those higher-level fences to whom she sold products appear not to have faced consequences. \u201cHow come \u2026 nothing happened to those people?\u201d she asked. In her guilty plea in 2022, Been specifically named one such fence to whom she \u201cfrequently sent stolen inventory\u201d as a man named Baruch \u201cButch\u201d Treff. Treff, in an interview with CNN, acknowledged buying products from Been, whom he said other vendors had recommended, but insisted he had no idea she had traded in stolen goods. \u201cIf I knew I would never have bought from her. I don\u2019t deal with stolen goods,\u201d Treff said. An attorney for Treff, Yosef Jacobovitch, added that his client did due diligence and met with Been to try to ensure she was a legitimate vendor. \u201cShe fooled him and others,\u201d Jacobovitch said. A government investigator familiar with the case, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said one of the challenges of such cases is determining whether higher-level fences knowingly purchased stolen goods for resale. The case against Been\u2019s organization\u00a0involved a range of state and federal authorities including Homeland Security Investigations and the IRS, but during a news conference, a federal prosecutor credited retail-industry investigators for contributing and called such collaborations a \u201cforce multiplier.\u201d Aside from supplying evidence, retailers sometimes identify broader trends of groups moving from city to city before law enforcement, said Sgt. Patrick Flynn of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department\u2019s organized retail crime unit, which launched last year. Patrick Walsh, an organized-retail-crime manager for grocery chain Kroger, said his company has heavily invested not only in its investigative capacity but also visual deterrents. For example, the company purchased an old police car to drive around parking lots to ward off would-be criminals. Some companies\u2019 efforts have backfired. In December, drugstore chain Rite Aid agreed to a five-year ban on facial recognition technology after the Federal Trade Commission found\u00a0that the company\u2019s use of the tech led to false shoplifting allegations against customers \u2013 especially people of color\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who appeared to match entries in a company watchlist. A Rite Aid spokesperson said the company is enhancing its information-security practices and policies. The way retailers have collected evidence for police with such tech has alarmed privacy-rights advocates. \u201cPolice are public entities. You can send them a public records request. You can elect a mayor who may want to change the police department. You cannot do that with a giant corporation. You have very little control over what technology they deploy, how they deploy it and then what they do with that data,\u201d said Matthew Guariglia, a senior policy analyst with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. Calls for more federal action The threat of organized retail crime and pressure from the industry has led some officials to call on the federal government to do more. Over the last year much of that push has centered on a federal bill, the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act, that would create an intelligence-sharing hub at the Department of Homeland Security and broaden the scope of applicable criminal conduct. San Diego County\u00a0District Attorney Summer Stephan, a Republican-turned-independent who expressed support for those changes at a congressional hearing in December, referred to limited coordination between law enforcement and retailers\u00a0and laws that apply relatively light penalties for habitual thieves as \u201ckey challenges\u201d in policing the issue. The bill has received\u00a0criticism. A coalition of civil rights groups that included the ACLU and NAACP argued in a letter in March that the legislation promotes punitive policies that would disproportionately affect marginalized communities and exacerbate poverty by pushing more crime into the federal system. \u201cThis enforcement-first response, we don\u2019t think that leads to crime deterrence,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 White, an attorney with one of those groups, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, told CNN. The bill has garnered support from a bipartisan group of lawmakers, but it has not advanced. \u201cEverything is stalled in Congress,\u201d said Rep. Dina Titus, a Nevada Democrat who helped introduce the legislation. Reacting to the way private retailers have been growing their internal investigative efforts, Titus said, \u201cThat\u2019s the reason we need to do something at the federal level\u2026 I\u2019m not trying to put down local law enforcement. I think they are doing the best they can with the resources they have.\u201d Congress has taken some steps to help the retail industry. A law that took effect last year requires online marketplaces to verify and disclose information on large, third-party sellers, such as bank account numbers. The law in effect makes it harder to sell stolen products through the internet with impunity. But industry sources argue online platforms could do more to police organized retail crime on their sites. Specifically, those marketplaces should more proactively question high-volume sellers of discounted goods and \u201cask for proof that these goods have been acquired lawfully,\u201d said Khris Hamlin, vice president of asset protection for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. Major online marketplaces say they have taken steps to combat such crime. Amazon touts a program that applies unique codes to certain products that can be used to detect and track stolen items. Mike Carson, eBay\u2019s senior director of global policy, said eBay has safeguards including automated processes that flag irregularities among items for sale, which can prompt further investigation. Browne of Home Depot said he welcomes more assistance from online marketplaces and the federal government. \u201cCrimes like drugs, human trafficking, they have major organizations going after this and rightfully so. Retail crimes have not gotten that same attention over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s expanded beyond the bandwidth of local and sometimes even state law enforcement.\u201d CNN\u2019s Nelli Black and Yahya Abou-Ghazala contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/retailers-crackdown-organized-crime-invs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_business_boeing-faa-plan-airplane-quality-problems", "text": "Boeing is expected to release a plan this week to fix its endless string of safety issues that have been under federal investigation following a midflight fuselage blowout in January. The report is a critical step for Boeing to rebuild confidence among the public, airlines, and its regulator that it can build safe airplanes after its reputation has been severely damaged by accidents, probes and whistleblower claims of shortcuts and retaliation. The plans may also reveal what Federal Aviation Administration inspectors found when auditing Boeing and key supplier Spirit AeroSystems factories earlier this year.\u00a0The FAA said it shared the findings with the two companies, but it has refused to make the report public so far. In late February, the FAA gave the planemaker and its outgoing chief executive 90 days to develop the plan and said it would not approve any Boeing request to expand Max production in the meantime. Since then, the FAA and Boeing have met multiple times about the company\u2019s progress and the plan\u2019s scope.\u00a0FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said last week he sees the plan as only the \u201cbeginning\u201d of a process for Boeing. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long road to get back to where they need to be making safe airplanes,\u201d Whitaker said in an ABC News interview. Years of safety issues This latest generation of Boeing\u2019s 737 first came under scrutiny when two Max planes crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people.\u00a0Multiple international and US investigations focused on a stabilization system called MCAS that pilots were not properly informed of. Boeing later agreed to financial penalties and a deferred prosecution agreement to settle a criminal charge of defrauding US regulators. Since then, successive issues with the Max and other aircraft \u2013 including the 787 Dreamliner, the 777 and the future Air Force One jet \u2013 have cost the company billions. The latest wave of reviews began in January, when a door plug blew out of a 737 Max 9 in-flight. Video shot by passengers on Alaska Airlines flight 1282 showed a gaping hole in the side of the aircraft as it urgently returned to the Portland, Oregon airport. The door plug later turned up in the brush of a schoolteacher\u2019s backyard. The FAA grounded Max 9s for three weeks and required each door plug undergo inspection.\u00a0National Transportation Safety Board investigators believe the plane left Boeing\u2019s factory last fall without critical bolts to hold the wall piece in place. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun admitted to a \u201cquality escape\u201d and later said he would join several other top officials by stepping down from the company this year. So significant have been the company\u2019s ongoing safety problems that the Department of Justice earlier this month said that Boeing had breached the terms of its deferred prosecution agreement over the 737 Max charge, meaning the company could be prosecuted over those incidents after all. The FAA also deployed auditors to the Wichita, Kansas, Spirit AeroSystems factory that builds the Max fuselage and the Renton, Washington, facility that finishes assembling the aircraft.\u00a0The inspection found \u201cmultiple instances where the companies allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements.\u201d But precisely what those failures are remains unclear. Whitaker, the FAA administrator, said in March the shortcomings reflect processes that are \u201creally important in a factory.\u201d The agency has told CNN they cannot make the report public because it is \u201cpart of an ongoing investigation.\u201d Then came the findings of an expert panel commissioned prior to the blowout that found gaps in Boeing\u2019s safety culture.\u00a0Employees feared retaliation for raising concerns and did not understand their role in producing safe airplanes, the panel of FAA officials and outside experts found. When the company stopped production for a day and polled its workers for potential safety improvements, ideas flooded in.\u00a0Boeing said the internal tip line received 500 percent more reports in the first few months of this year compared to last year. In the meantime, Boeing said it has made immediate changes to improve quality.\u00a0The company has cracked down on out-of-order assembly line work, improved production line instructions, purchased additional tools for workstations and ordered Spirit AeroSystems to wait until fuselages are complete before sending them to Boeing. \u201cOnce they get to our factory, rework is lower, flow time is better, traveled work is less,\u201d Boeing Chief Financial Officer Brian West said at an industry conference last week.\u201cWe\u2019re not declaring victory, but we know this was the right move, and we\u2019ll begin to reap the benefits.\u201d While investigations into the door plug incident continue, and while the prospect of a criminal trial hangs over Boeing, the company will have a new plan for improvements.\u00a0Its marching orders for the plan include addressing the audit and expert panel findings and explaining how it will integrate safety and quality assurance policies into practice.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/business/boeing-faa-plan-airplane-quality-problems/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}

In a letter to BuzzFeed\u2019s board, a copy of which Ramaswamy posted online, the MAGA hardliner and former Republican presidential candidate recommended laying off large swaths of the company\u2019s existing staff. He encouraged BuzzFeed\u2019s board to transform the outlet into a creator-driven platform, suggesting it hire personalities akin to fellow radicals\u00a0Candace Owens\u00a0and\u00a0Tucker Carlson. He requested that the board add three unnamed directors to its ranks to increase \u201cdiversity of thought.\u201d And, finally, Ramaswamy implored BuzzFeed to issue a public apology to the country for having supposedly lied about\u00a0Donald Trump, Covid-19 and various other issues. \u201cAddress your audience directly and candidly admit: We failed in our obligation to tell you the truth,\u201d Ramaswamy encouraged BuzzFeed. \u201cBy both omission and commission, we repeatedly lied on issues of national importance, and so did the rest of the media.\u201d Needless to say, Ramaswamy\u2019s proposal is not a serious one. He obviously knows that BuzzFeed is not going be issuing any apologies for supposedly lying to the public. And it goes without saying that BuzzFeed co-founder and boss\u00a0Jonah Peretti\u00a0is not going to adopt a business plan that would deform his company and remold it into a\u00a0Rumble-like platform that would disseminate MAGA disinformation for profit. \u201cWhat few business ideas he presents in his letter are distinctly un-original and reflects media truisms and conventional platitudes, none of which could possibly be new to BuzzFeed or any experienced media leaders,\u201d\u00a0Jeffrey A Sonnenfeld, the renowned professor and senior associate dean for leadership studies at the\u00a0Yale School of Management, told me Tuesday. \u201cHe praises his three nominees for the board and pressures BuzzFeed into accepting them without publicly identifying who they are and whether they are qualified beyond their loyalty to Vivek. He is, in short, trying to hijack BuzzFeed and turn it into a pliable Vivek Ramaswamy in-house news organ \u2014 VivekNews so to speak.\u201d While BuzzFeed was once the upstart darling of the digital media era, soaring with massive audience scale on the back of social media referrals and quirky quizzes, changes to\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and other platforms\u2019 algorithms took the wind out of the outlet\u2019s sails. Since BuzzFeed went public in 2021 via a SPAC, shares in the company have plunged 92%, trading at $3 on Tuesday. Though the company has fallen on hard times, most notably shuttering its award-winning news division and selling off\u00a0Complex, it continues to operate\u00a0The Huffington Post,\u00a0Tasty,\u00a0First We Feast\u00a0and other major internet brands. Peretti, in his emailed response to Ramaswamy, was more cordial than Sonnenfeld. But it was apparent that he does not view the right-wing entrepreneur\u2019s ideas for the future of BuzzFeed as compelling. \u201cBased on your letter, you have some fundamental misunderstandings about the drivers of our business, the values of our audience, and the mission of the company,\u201d Peretti wrote. \u201cI\u2019m very skeptical it makes business sense to turn BuzzFeed into a creator platform for inflammatory political pundits. And we\u2019re definitely not going to issue an apology for our\u00a0Pulitzer Prize-winning journalism.\u201d Peretti said he does \u201cwelcome outside perspectives from shareholders\u201d and would meet with Ramaswamy. Though in doing so, Peretti made it clear Ramaswamy does not call the shots at the company and would have to consult with Peretti\u2019s executive assistant to \u201cschedule a time to meet.\u201d Indeed, while Ramaswamy disclosed that he has taken an 8.3% stake in BuzzFeed\u2019s class A shares, a position he said he continues to increase, he has little actual power over the direction of the company. That is because Peretti owns 96% of class B shares, which each come with 50 votes compared to the single vote a class A share offers. As it currently stands, Peretti has 64% voting power compared to Ramaswamy\u2019s paltry 2.6%. In other words, Peretti remains \u2014\u00a0by far\u00a0\u2014 the actual boss at BuzzFeed. Ramaswamy\u2019s antics might generate noise, but that\u2019s all it ultimately is. So what does Ramaswamy really want from this affair? Occam\u2019s razor would suggest the noise and attention it brings, which has been the apparent motivating factor behind the various moves he has made in recent years, including running for president. As Sonnenfeld derived from his letter, Ramaswamy\u2019s proposal \u201coozes with self-promotion and seemingly reflects an ideological crusade much more than a serious business turnaround plan.\u201d Asked how Peretti and the BuzzFeed board should address Ramaswamy\u2019s activist stake, Sonnenfeld was not subtle: \u201cRamaswamy has little credibility amongst the investors who comprise BuzzFeed\u2019s shareholder base, less credibility with their subscribers, and BuzzFeed\u2019s board should not allow him to hijack the company with such a minor stake and turn BuzzFeed into the Vivek Ramaswamy in-house news organ.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/media/buzzfeed-vivek-ramaswamy-trolling/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}

Earnings season is winding down, and a strange confluence of events is occurring \u2014 the economy is softening, but corporate profits are accelerating. Some analysts think that means good news for stocks in the second half of the year.  What\u2019s happening: Last week proved that investors are on edge and scrambling for clues about what comes next \u2014 even relatively insignificant economic indicators are capturing outsized attention on Wall Street. The Dow plunged by more than 600 points, notching its worst day of the year so far, on Thursday after the Purchasing Managers Index for May, expected to fall slightly, came in 3.5 percentage points higher month-over-month. That, in turn, suggested to investors that the Federal Reserve won\u2019t be cutting interest rates anytime soon, sparking the selloff. PMIs provide early insights into the economic health of the manufacturing and services sectors by surveying purchasing managers on their business conditions. It\u2019s a useful tool, but doesn\u2019t typically get a lot of attention on Wall Street. Other data, like Institute for Supply Management reports, are generally considered more comprehensive and influential. Last weeks wild reaction to the PMI highlights the market\u2019s current sensitivity to economic data as investors fret over Fed interest rate decisions. Even secondary economic indicators are shaping market sentiment and influencing investment decisions as Wall Street worries that a more robust economic environment can mean higher-for-longer interest rates. Yes, but: There\u2019s an interesting dynamic at play as investors worry about corporate profits and a stronger economy at the same time, wrote Bank of America analysts in a note on Tuesday. Higher interest rates can increase borrowing costs and reduce corporate profits, leading to a sell-off in equities as investors adjust their expectations for future growth and profitability \u2014 that\u2019s where the worry comes from. But that hasn\u2019t really happened. At least not yet. About 97% of S&P 500 companies have reported their first quarter earnings at this point. And so far, they\u2019ve beat consensus earnings-per-share estimates by about 3%, according to Bank of America. Earnings are up by 7% since this time last year, and all 11 S&P 500 sectors, with the exception of healthcare, beat estimates. There were some concerns about companies lowering their outlook for the rest of the year, but, overall, estimates for the remainder of 2024 have slightly risen this quarter. \u201cThe equity cycle feels different than the macro cycle today. While [gross domestic product] and the labor market seem to be slowing, earnings are accelerating,\u201d wrote the Bank of America analysts. Historically, a slowing economy and accelerating earnings backdrop has been the best environment for stocks, they wrote. This could point to a strong second half of the year for markets. Yes, but, but: That also means that there could be a lot of sensitivity and extreme market swings when economic data comes in stronger than expected, which we saw last week. Still, the Fed is only part of the equation. Goods and manufacturing represent about half of earnings for the S&P 500, the BofA analysts wrote. But they make up less than 20% of the US economy. That means an improving manufacturing cycle but slowing services can lead to a divergence between market performance and economic performance. Coming up next: All eyes, meanwhile, are on the release of the US Personal Consumption Expenditures index for April on Friday \u2014 that\u2019s the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge. There are also some notable earnings reports coming in this week \u2014 including Salesforce, Dell and Marvell. In consumer sectors, the list includes Dollar General and Costco. US home prices hit another record high in March US home prices reached a record high in March, reflecting the housing market\u2019s persistent affordability crisis. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index, a measure of home prices across the country, jumped 6.5% in March from a year earlier to a record high. It is the sixth time the index has reached a new record high over the past year. The report showed that there\u2019s strong demand for housing in urban population centers such as San Diego, New York, Cleveland and Los Angeles. The 20-city index rose in March at a slightly faster pace than in February. \u201cThis month\u2019s report boasts another all-time high,\u201d said Brian Luke, head of commodities, real and digital assets, at S&P Dow Jones Indices. \u201cWe\u2019ve witnessed records repeatedly break in both stock and housing markets over the past year.\u201d In addition to unrelentingly high home prices, the housing market is also grappling with a chronic lack of homes on the market and elevated mortgage rates. Put together, it has resulted in a tough housing market, especially first-time buyers. Read more here. Here\u2019s how new AI tech could change the iPhone Imagine asking Apple\u2019s\u00a0Siri to show\u00a0you\u00a0an old photo taken from a child\u2019s second birthday, or summarizing lengthy emails and writing drafts. Then consider Siri learning your schedule, preferences, even your personality, so it can better communicate with you throughout the day. Generative AI, artificial intelligence that can provide thoughtful and thorough responses to questions and prompts, could potentially breathe new life into Apple\u2019s iPhone lineup at a time when competitors are threatening to leave the company behind in the race to shape what could be a world-changing technology, reports my colleague Samantha Murphy Kelly. The company is widely\u00a0expected\u00a0to partner with ChatGPT maker OpenAI ahead of its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June, where it will likely show off its first batch of AI tools coming to the iOS software. Although artificial intelligence has powered some of the iPhone\u2019s experiences for years, such as\u00a0Live Text\u00a0and improved autocorrect, generative AI could unlock new levels of interaction and personalization. All this during a time when the company is under pressure to catch up to rivals such as Google and Samsung,\u00a0which are already using the technology in its smartphones. \u201cWe see generative AI as a key opportunity across our products and believe we have advantages that set us apart there,\u201d\u00a0Apple CEO Tim Cook said\u00a0on the company\u2019s most recent earnings call in early May, noting there would be news announced in the \u201cweeks ahead.\u201d Read more here.

Gemini, the exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, said Wednesday that it has secured a 232% recovery for customers who participated in its lending program, Earn, a partnership with a third party that halted withdrawals as turmoil gripped crypto markets in November 2022. More than 230,000 Gemini customers lost access to approximately $940 million worth of digital assets. In the year and a half since then, crypto has staged a comeback, bringing the value of the frozen funds to $2.18 billion. \u201cWe are thrilled that we have been able to achieve this recovery for our customers. We recognize the hardship caused by this lengthy process and appreciate our customers\u2019 continued support and patience throughout,\u201d Cameron Winklevoss, Gemini\u2019s president, said in a statement. Gemini agreed in February to return at least $1.1 billion to customers of the lending program and pay a $37 million fine for unsafe and unsound practices as part of a settlement with the New York Department of Financial Services. Wednesday\u2019s announcement accounts for the appreciation of value in crypto, adding more than $1 billion to the total. If, for example, a customer had lent one bitcoin in the Earn program, they can now expect to receive one bitcoin back. At the time FTX imploded, causing chaos in crypto markets, bitcoin sank precipitously to around $17,500. A year and a half later, one bitcoin fetches just under $70,000. Earn customers can expect to receive their remaining asset balance within the next 12 months, Gemini said. Customers of FTX, once the second-largest crypto exchange on the planet, are also expected to be made whole, with interest, thanks in part to the rising value of FTX\u2019s crypto holdings and smart bets on artificial intelligence that it was able to liquidate.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/business/gemini-crypto-bankruptcy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}

It is discounting thousands of grocery items in a bid to entice price-conscious shoppers to add a little bit more to their shopping carts. The online grocery delivery service, which also operates a handful of physical stores, said its shoppers in the United States will see discounts every day of up to 30% on 4,000 items in-store and online, and those markdowns will rotate weekly. A number of big retailers in recent weeks, including Target and Walmart, have lowered their prices as they strive to pull consumers into stores and online to spend more freely on both essential purchases such as food and more discretionary purchases like new clothes, decorative items for the home, arts and\u00a0crafts or hobby kits. Retailers are feeling jittery after they jacked up prices as inflation spiked in recent years. But now, households aren\u2019t shopping like they used to, and high prices are forcing Americans to choose between wants and needs. In the game of chicken between stores and shoppers, it\u2019s the stores that finally appear to be yielding. That\u2019s a problem not just for individual shoppers or even big retail chains but for the whole American economy, of which about two-thirds comes from consumer spending. Shoppers have pulled back for a year now as costs have risen 20% to 30% higher than they were three years ago and as incomes failed to keep up, said Sarah Wyeth, managing director, retail and consumer with S&P Global Ratings. This is making consumers across income levels look for deals. \u201cThere\u2019s just less dollars for consumers to spend,\u201d Wyeth said. The challenge for retailers now is to shake consumers out of that frugal mindset, she added. What\u2019s getting cheaper on Amazon Fresh The price cuts include meat, seafood, frozen food, dairy and cheese, beverages, snacks and pastas, the retailer told CNN Friday. The discounted food items will include national brands and Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) private label products. \u201cIncreasing our weekly deals across thousands of items and expanding the reach of Prime Savings at Amazon Fresh is just one way that we\u2019re continuing to invest in competitive pricing and savings for all of our customers \u2013 both in-store and online,\u201d Claire Peters, worldwide vice president with Amazon Fresh, said in a statement. For Prime members, Amazon Fresh is stacking more savings by offering a 10% discount on hundreds of online grocery items. Competitors are cutting, too Target\u00a0this week slashed prices on more than 1,500 popular items, ranging from butter to laundry detergent, in its attempt to pull in more shoppers. It said Target (TGT) shoppers can expect \u201cthousands more price cuts\u201d \u2014 amounting to 5,000 items \u2014 being reduced over the summer and that its lower prices aim \u201ccollectively save consumers millions of dollars\u201d on household staples and everyday items such as milk, fresh fruit, diapers and even pet food.

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can \u201clisten\u201d to people\u2019s questions and converse in real time. \u201cShellie\u201d can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while \u201cArif\u201d is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}

Users must have owned those models between September 16, 2016, and January 3, 2023, and either complained to Apple regarding an issue, such as FaceTime, the loudspeaker, Siri or the voice memo app not working or paid for a related repair. Apple denied the devices had these issues and all allegations of wrongdoing, according to the Settlement Administration website. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The issue stemmed from the audio chip, which manages how sound comes out of the speakers or through headphones.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_economy_new-cleveland-fed-president-beth-hammack", "text": "The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland announced Wednesday that Beth M. Hammack will be its next president and chief executive officer after current president Loretta Mester retires at the end of June. Hammack, 52, joins the Cleveland Fed after three decades at Goldman Sachs. She is slated to vote on monetary policy decisions as of August 21, when her term officially starts. For the July meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee will be voting in place of the Cleveland Fed. At every Fed meeting, 12 Fed officials vote, seven of whom are from the Fed\u2019s board of governors. Aside from New York Fed President John Williams, the remaining votes are from an annually rotating panel of regional Fed presidents. Goolsbee is currently an alternate voter and otherwise would not have voted until 2025. Goolsbee has been a bit more optimistic than some of his colleagues regarding the progress he expects on getting inflation back down to the Fed\u2019s 2% target. However, it\u2019s unclear where Hammack stands on monetary policy. The central bank is currently mulling when to begin cutting interest rates after raising them to a two-decade high last summer. Inflation stalled earlier this year, which prompted the Fed to delay the timing of its first rate cut, but weaker-than-expected figures on employment and spending thrust rate cuts back into the conversation. Who is Hammack? Through her three-decade career at the Wall Street bank, Hammack has developed experience working with policymakers and serving on advisory boards, according to a release from the Cleveland Fed. She was chair of the federal government\u2019s Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee and a member of the Financial Research Advisory Committee and the Treasury Market Practices Group. She\u2019s also currently the chair of the board of the nonprofit organization Math for America. Hammack earned a bachelor of arts degree in quantitative economics and history from Stanford University. \u201cBeth has a deep understanding of financial markets and the monetary policy transmission process, expertise in leading complex business lines, and a proven commitment to mission-focused work,\u201d said Heidi Gartland, chair of the presidential search committee and the Cleveland Fed\u2019s board of directors, in a release. Mester, who has been president of the Cleveland Fed since 2014, has typically had so-called \u201chawkish\u201d views, or pronounced concerns about inflation. She recently said monetary policy is currently in a good place, and that there is no rush to cut rates at the moment. A pivotal moment for the Fed Hammack is joining the Fed as officials deal with the difficult task of figuring out when to begin cutting rates. It\u2019s a consequential decision that carries risks if central bankers cut too soon and if they cut too late. The Fed\u2019s September meeting will be the first opportunity for Hammack to vote on US monetary policy. She joins the central bank at a critical juncture, as more Fed officials could start to vote differently from one another, which hasn\u2019t been the case for years. Currently, investors are split as to whether the Fed will keep rates at current levels or lower rates in September. The Fed\u2019s main tool is its key interest rate, which influences borrowing costs across the US economy. The Fed is tasked by Congress to stabilize prices and maximize employment, so, broadly speaking, when inflation is too high, the Fed jacks up borrowing costs; when unemployment is too high, it lowers interest rates. If the Fed were to introduce its first rate cut of this cycle too soon, inflation could resurge as the economy reheats. If it cuts too late, the economy could cool too much and slip into a recession. Hammack is yet another fresh face at the Fed\u2019s main policymaking body, after the appointment of Alberto Musalem to helm the St. Louis Fed earlier this year. Last year, Jeffery Schmid became the president of the Kansas City Fed. Also, Adriana Kugler was confirmed for a role as Fed governor and Philip Jefferson was elevated as Fed vice chair. Lisa Cook was confirmed for another term.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/economy/new-cleveland-fed-president-beth-hammack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}

This is inaccurate,\u201d Joe Erlinger,\u00a0president of McDonald\u2019s USA, wrote in an open letter posted to the company\u2019s website on Wednesday. \u201cThe average price of a Big Mac in the U.S. was $4.39 in 2019,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite a global pandemic and historic rises in supply chain costs, wages and other inflationary pressures in the years that followed, the average cost is now $5.29. That\u2019s an increase of 21% (not 100%).\u201d What Erlinger wants customers to know is not that high-priced McDonald\u2019s burgers don\u2019t exist at all. He just wants them to know that the burgers that have been cited as proof of radically higher prices are not the norm. \u201cIt frustrates and worries me, and many of our franchisees, when I hear about an $18 Big Mac meal being sold \u2014 even if it was at one location in the U.S. out of more than 13,700,\u201d he said. \u201cMore worrying, though, is when people believe that this is the rule and not the exception, or when folks start to suggest that the prices of a Big Mac have risen 100% since 2019.\u201d Online, people have been airing their fast food price grievances. But they\u2019re not just griping: Customers are pulling back on spending, too. Diners, frustrated by higher prices, are not going out to eat as often and spending less when they do, causing fast food sales to slow and traffic to dip. Erlinger is fighting back because McDonald\u2019s pricey burgers have become something of a symbol of elevated fast food prices. And being seen as overpriced could hamper sales and reputation, especially at McDonald\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that we continue to keep affordability at the forefront for our customers,\u201d McDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski said during an April 30 analyst call. \u201cWe literally wrote the playbook on value, and we are committed to upholding our leadership within the industry.\u201d To win back consumers, the burger chain is also reportedly considering adding a $5 value meal to the menu for a limited time. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported\u00a0that McDonald\u2019s is planning to start running its $5 meal promotion at the end of June. A recent statement from the National Owner\u2019s Association, a group for McDonald\u2019s franchise operators, indicated that operators were still deciding whether to adopt the promotion, which would include chicken nuggets, fries, a soft drink and either a McDouble or McChicken sandwich for $5. A NOA representative declined to comment on the status of the vote. Erlinger nodded to the possibility of a national $5 value meal in his letter. \u201cI fully expect the prices at your local McDonald\u2019s to be an area of conversation and focus in the coming months,\u201d he said. \u201cAs it does, I hope you\u2019ll see the programs we\u2019re launching nationally and locally as meaningful to you.\u201d \u2014 CNN\u2019s Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/business/mcdonalds-burger-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_24_business_tesla-shanghai-battery-factory-trade-tariffs", "text": "Tesla broke ground on a new manufacturing plant in Shanghai on Thursday, just weeks after CEO Elon Musk made a surprise visit to China in a bid to shore up the carmaker\u2019s slumping sales. The factory, which was announced in April last year, aims to begin production in the first quarter of 2025. It will be able to make 10,000 Megapacks \u2014 very large batteries used to store huge amounts of electricity \u2014 each year, according to a statement by Lingang Group, the government-owned developer of the area housing the plant. The battery facility will be close to Tesla\u2019s Shanghai Gigafactory, which is the company\u2019s largest plant outside the United States, producing almost one million cars a year. Megapacks are meant to be used to help stabilize energy grids. Each unit can store enough energy on average to power 3,600 homes for one hour, the company says. They are designed to be deployed by utilities and power stations. The $200 million project comes as tensions between Beijing and Washington are rising over geopolitics and trade barriers, and underscores the US carmaker\u2019s commitment to China, the world\u2019s largest EV market and Tesla\u2019s primary vehicle export hub. \u201cFor Tesla, it\u2019s an important milestone,\u201d Tom Zhu, senior vice president of Tesla, was quoted as saying in an article posted on the Shanghai government website on Friday. Rising tensions While most Western companies are face rising barriers to doing business in China, things have been smoother for Tesla. Shanghai said Friday it had taken both sides only a month to negotiate and conclude a deal to build the factory on the land near Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory. The company was able to move similarly quickly when it built that first factory in 2019. Wu Xiaohua, a Shanghai government official, said at the commencement ceremony Thursday that the city would assist Tesla in finishing the construction and putting the factory into operation \u201cas soon as this year.\u201d Musk met with Chinese premier Li Qiang during his visit late last month. Li praised Tesla as a \u201csuccessful model\u201d for US-China collaboration. Beijing has been ramping up efforts to accelerate EV production to counter a property-induced economic slowdown and promote a low carbon economy. But as domestic demand weakens, Beijing is also encouraging manufacturers to seek new growth opportunities in overseas markets. That puts the industry at the heart of growing trade tensions with the US and Europe. Earlier this month, President Joe Biden said that\u00a0tariffs on $18 billion\u00a0worth of imports of Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) and an array of other products would soar over the next two years. EVs imported from China will see their tariffs nearly quadruple from 27.5% to 100%, a policy lever meant to challenge Beijing\u2019s practice of encouraging aggressively low pricing by domestic EV manufacturers while levying a 40% tariff on US car imports. The White House said the measures were designed to protect American workers and businesses in the face of China\u2019s unfair trade practices, including \u201cflooding global markets with artificially low-priced exports.\u201d Speaking in January, Musk said Chinese EV makers could put many of their rivals out of business unless tariffs were raised. \u201cFrankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world,\u201d Musk told analysts on an earnings call. At a tech conference in Paris this week, he struck a different tone, saying he was opposed to measures that distorted the market. \u201cNeither Tesla nor I asked for these tariffs, in fact I was surprised when they were announced,\u201d\u00a0Musk\u00a0told VivaTech 2024 via video link, according to Reuters. \u201cTesla competes quite well in the market in China with no tariffs and no deferential support.

But just days after the launch, the company is already walking back some factually incorrect results. Google earlier this month introduced an AI-generated search results overview tool, which summarizes search results so that users don\u2019t have to click through multiple links to get quick answers to their questions. But the feature came under fire this week after it provided false or misleading information to some users\u2019 questions. For example, several users posted on X that Google\u2019s AI summary said that former President Barack Obama is a Muslim, a common misconception. In fact, Obama is a Christian. Another user posted that a Google AI summary said that \u201cnone of Africa\u2019s 54 recognized countries start with the letter \u2018K\u2019\u201d \u2014 clearly forgetting Kenya. Google confirmed to CNN on Friday that the AI overviews for both queries had been removed for violating the company\u2019s policies. \u201cThe vast majority of AI Overviews provide high quality information, with links to dig deeper on the web,\u201d Google spokesperson Colette Garcia said in a statement, adding that some other viral examples of Google AI flubs appear to have been manipulated images. \u201cWe conducted extensive testing before launching this new experience, and as with other features we\u2019ve launched in Search, we appreciate the feedback. We\u2019re taking swift action where appropriate under our content policies.\u201d The bottom of each Google AI search overview acknowledges that \u201cgenerative AI is experimental.\u201d And the company says it conducts testing designed to imitate potential bad actors in an effort to prevent false or low-quality results from showing up in AI summaries. Google\u2019s search overviews are part of the company\u2019s larger push to incorporate its Gemini AI technology across all of its products as it attempts to keep up in the AI arms race with rivals like OpenAI and Meta. But this week\u2019s debacle shows the risk that adding AI \u2013 which has a tendency to confidently state false information \u2013 could undermine Google\u2019s reputation as the trusted source to search for information online. Even on less serious searches, Google\u2019s AI overview appears to sometimes provide wrong or confusing information. In one test, CNN asked Google, \u201chow much sodium is in pickle juice.\u201d The AI overview responded that an 8 fluid ounce-serving of pickle juice contains 342 milligrams of sodium but that a serving less than half the size (3 fluid ounces) contained more than double the sodium (690 milligrams). (Best Maid pickle juice, for sale at Walmart, lists 250 milligrams of sodium in just 1 ounce.) CNN also searched: \u201cdata used for google ai training.\u201d In its response, the AI overview acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s unclear if Google prevents copyrighted materials from being included\u201d in the online data scraped to train its AI models, referencing a major concern about how AI firms operate. It\u2019s not the first time Google has had to walk back the capabilities of its AI tools over an embarrassing flub.

{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_business_uk-royal-mail-sale", "text": "The owner of Royal Mail has accepted a \u00a33.57 billion ($4.6 billion) takeover bid from Czech billionaire Daniel K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd, paving the way for the sale of one of Britain\u2019s oldest and most iconic institutions to a foreign owner for the first time. International Distribution Services, which owns the loss-making postal service, said Wednesday that it had accepted a \u00a33.70-per-share ($4.69) takeover offer from K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd\u2019s EP Group. The deal has consequences for thousands of workers and has sparked anxiety about the future of a key piece of national infrastructure, which delivers a vital public service. EP Group has made several commitments to address these concerns, including upholding Royal Mail\u2019s \u201cuniversal service obligation,\u201d which requires it to deliver letters six days a week everywhere in the United Kingdom for the same flat fee. It has also promised to maintain employee benefits and pensions, and keep Royal Mail\u2019s headquarters and tax base in the UK. \u201cThe EP group has the utmost respect for Royal Mail\u2019s history and tradition, and I know that owning this business will come with enormous responsibility \u2014 not just to the employees but to the citizens who rely on its services every day,\u201d K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd said in a statement. He added that IDS has the potential \u201cto become one of the largest postal logistics groups in Europe,\u201d but that its \u201cmarket is evolving quickly\u201d and it must modernize to keep up with rival delivery services. K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd\u2019s Vesa Equity Investment, a private equity firm, is already the largest shareholder in IDS, with a 27.6% stake. Politically sensitive The deal follows a torrid few years for Royal Mail, which was privatized in 2013. It has suffered a sharp drop in demand for its services and recorded a loss of \u00a3348 million ($445 million) for the year that ended on March 31 \u2014 a slightly better result than the previous year when it lost \u00a3419 million ($536 million). \u201cThe IDS Board believes that the offer from EP is fair and reasonable given that there are uncertainties ahead and allows investors to realise value at a significant premium,\u201d IDS chairman Keith Williams said in the statement. Not everyone is convinced, however. Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, which represents about 110,000 Royal Mail workers, said the takeover was \u201ca direct result of a failed and ideological privatisation over a decade ago mixed with the blatant mismanagement of the company in recent years.\u201d Workers wanted further commitments from EP Group on the future of the company, he said. \u201cWe do welcome some of the commitments that have been made but the reality is postal workers across the UK have lost all faith in the senior management of Royal Mail and the service has been deliberately run down,\u201d he added in a statement. K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd\u2019s move comes at a sensitive moment politically as the United Kingdom gears up for a general election on July 4. The proposed takeover will be subject to a national security review, possibly by a new government. Opinion polls suggest the Labour Party will win its first election since 2005 and replace the incumbent Conservative administration. Labour has already taken a keen interest in the deal. \u201cRoyal Mail is as British as it gets, and Labour will take the necessary steps to safeguard its undeniable identity and place in public life,\u201d Jonathan Reynolds, the party\u2019s business spokesperson, wrote in a letter to K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd earlier this month. A low-profile Czech national, K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd made his fortune through a sprawling empire of European energy companies, retailers and football clubs. He is worth an estimated $7.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and owns a 27% stake in West Ham United Football Club.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/business/uk-royal-mail-sale/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_tech_prisoners-virtual-reality-mechanic-job-training", "text": "In her first week of job training, Tiffany Joseph Busch learned how to do an oil change. \u201cIf I had known it was this easy then I wouldn\u2019t have been paying for oil changes,\u201d she said she told her instructor. But Busch never interacted with an actual car during the training. Instead, she learned in a virtual garage, using a Meta Quest virtual reality headset. Busch, 36, is incarcerated at the Maryland Correctional Institution for Women and is part of an early group of trainees learning skills in virtual reality that will prepare them to pursue jobs as auto technicians upon their release. For Busch, who expects to be released in June after being incarcerated on-and-off since age 19, the program will give her a crucial head start in rebuilding her life outside of prison. \u201cIt\u2019s dire that we get some type of training,\u201d Busch told CNN in an interview at the prison last month. \u201cI\u2019m excited to be able to go home and use what we have (learned) here.\u201d Although virtual reality technology has been around for more than a decade, it\u2019s still often thought of as a relatively niche technology used largely by gamers. But MCIW \u2014 in partnership with Baltimore-based nonprofit Vehicles for Change, which developed the program \u2014 is exploring whether VR headsets could make career training opportunities more accessible inside prisons. The ultimate goal is to reduce recidivism rates by ensuring incarcerated people have a clear path to good-paying jobs once they\u2019re released. Across the United States, auto technicians are in strong demand; trade groups say the industry sees tens of thousands of jobs go unfilled each year. And in Maryland, such positions often pay above the state\u2019s $15 per hour minimum wage. \u201cThis isn\u2019t rocket science. It\u2019s a matter of getting people a job that leads to a career, and we can keep people out of prison,\u201d said Vehicles for Change President Martin Schwartz. \u201cIf they can get a job that\u2019s going to pay $16 to $20 an hour, we can change the trajectory of that recidivism rate.\u201d Auto mechanic training goes virtual Vehicles for Change was founded in 1999 to provide low-income families with affordable cars. In 2016, the nonprofit developed an in-person auto technician training program for formerly incarcerated people, where participants would receive paid job training while repairing cars to go to the organization\u2019s clients. The organization has relationships with employers such as Napa Auto Parts and AAA, representatives of which sit on its board, to help graduates secure full-time work after completing the program. But during the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of trainees that Vehicles for Change could safely allow into its garages dipped, so Schwartz began exploring alternate ways of delivering the training. He was eventually connected to software company HTX Labs, which had built virtual reality training programs for the US Air Force and later designed the auto mechanic training program for Vehicles for Change. In addition to MCIW, the nonprofit is also piloting the VR auto technician training program in correctional facilities in Texas and Virginia. For leaders in Maryland\u2019s correctional department, the VR program provided a way to expand job training for a field in need of workers to the Women\u2019s Correctional Institute quickly and easily. The corrections department works \u201cvery closely with (the state\u2019s) Department of Labor to determine what the industry needs are, where the vacancies are,\u201d according to Carolyn Scruggs, Maryland\u2019s secretary of public safety and correctional services. Several of the state\u2019s other prisons have hands-on mechanic training programs, but building a new garage means having to find the space and bringing in expensive equipment \u2014 processes further complicated by the strict security measures prisons must maintain. Although the headsets cost nearly $500 each, they\u2019re still more affordable than providing conventional, hands-on training programs. \u201cBringing in VR, it eliminates all that needed space or funding that we would need to build an entire classroom,\u201d said Danielle Cox, director of education at the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, who oversees the correctional department\u2019s 26 different job training programs. \u201cAlso, it gets them something within a couple of weeks that would take a longer time if they were doing hands-on within the classroom,\u201d Cox said. \u201cSo we can have some women \u2026 take this opportunity and actually get out and get a job as soon as they are released.\u201d Now on its third cohort, the program at MCIW has graduated 15 women since it began last year. \u2018There is something outside of here\u2019 The women at MCIW come to the facility\u2019s gymnasium, reminiscent of a high school gym, for the training. When they put the headsets on, they\u2019re transported to a virtual auto repair garage, where they can operate the car lift and use various tools. By the time they complete the program, trainees are prepared for jobs as tire lube technicians \u2014 roles available at places like Jiffy Lube or Mr. Tire \u2014 and for the Automotive Service Excellence exam, the nationally recognized certification for auto mechanics. \u201cI think the best part about it, for incarcerated people, is you get to escape from this place, and it reminds you that there is something outside of here,\u201d said Meagan Carpenter, another one of the MCIW trainees. \u201cI want to be able to show my children, especially my daughter, that anything a man can do, we can do better or the same,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I want to be a good representative for this program \u2026 sometimes we just need that one program to have faith in us and give us an opportunity.\u201d But is it really possible to learn how to fix a car in virtual reality without ever interacting with a real vehicle? Carpenter said she feels \u201c100% confident in my abilities.\u201d And Schwartz said he\u2019s certain about the potential for VR training, too. He added that given the need for auto workers, employers are often happy to show trainees how to take what they\u2019ve learned in the digital world to operate safely in a real garage. \u201cVirtual reality is number one going to be the way we train the skill trades in five years across the board,\u201d he said. \u201cThis technology is going to change, certainly (in-prison) training, but it\u2019s going to make a huge difference for the marginalized populations that we have in this country that can\u2019t afford to go to a community college to get an automotive degree or a trade school \u2026 We\u2019re not only going to fill the gap for trades, but we\u2019re going to change poverty in this country by using virtual reality.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/tech/prisoners-virtual-reality-mechanic-job-training/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Buying or selling a stock is about to get a lot snappier starting next Tuesday. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll get smoother, at least right away \u2014 and some financial firms are preparing to handle any possible bumpiness. The current standard settlement cycle for broker-dealer transactions is \u201cT+2.\u201d That means that it takes two business days from when you buy a stock to when that transaction \u201csettles,\u201d or when the stock is officially transferred to the buyer\u2019s account and cash is delivered to the seller\u2019s account. That\u2019s been the norm since 2017. Starting May 28, that cycle will take just one business day, or \u201cT+1.\u201d \u201cFor everyday investors who sell their stock on a Monday, shortening the settlement cycle will allow them to get their money on Tuesday,\u201d Gary Gensler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a press release. \u201cIt will make our market plumbing more resilient, timely and orderly.\u201d These new rules will apply to stocks, bonds, municipal securities, exchange-traded funds, some mutual funds and limited partnerships that trade on an exchange. Broker-dealers and registered investment advisors will also have to follow new recordkeeping rules. Some investors say that a shorter cycle should help free up more liquidity in the market and reduce volatility in margins \u2014 the collateral traders have to show \u2014 since it reduces the chance of default before the transaction goes through. Clearinghouses, which sit between buyers and sellers, collect margins from traders as evidence that they can afford to make the transaction. \u201cAssuming everything goes well and we don\u2019t see any hiccups, the move towards T+1 will be an overall benefit to our ecosystem, institutional investors and retail [investors],\u201d said Rich Lee, head of program trading and execution strategy at Baird. Baird has had a T+1 committee in place since last summer to ensure such hiccups don\u2019t happen, Lee said. Employees have been in discussions with clients about how to assist them through the process. The company has also staffed up to handle their part in clearing trades with a shorter time frame. The shortened settlement cycle is partly in response to the 2021 meme stock frenzy, when investors on Reddit sent shares of GameStop and AMC Entertainment soaring to eye-popping heights in a short span of time. (Meme stocks typically trade less on fundamentals and more on social media frenzy.)  Robinhood and other brokerages in 2021 temporarily suspended buying of GameStop, AMC and other stocks on its platform, blaming in part the T+2 rule that pushed up collateral requirements imposed on brokers like Robinhood. Investors were left waiting for their trades and brokers with their cash locked up until the settlement, unable to allow more purchasing to ensure they had enough funds to cover the trades. \u201cThe existing two-day period to settle trades exposes investors and the industry to unnecessary risk and is ripe for change,\u201d Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said in a February 2021 release. \u201cThere is no reason why the greatest financial system the world has ever seen cannot settle trades in real time.\u201d Boeing on track to meet FAA deadline to present quality control fixes Boeing will present its plan to fix quality problems with its assembly line to US regulators next week, the company said Thursday. The plan was ordered up by the Federal Aviation Administration in late February after a hole blew open in the side of an airborne 737 Max a month earlier, reports my colleague Gregory Wallace. The FAA said it audited the production line at Boeing and its key 737 Max supplier and found \u201cmultiple instances where the companies allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements.\u201d It gave Boeing 90 days to present a plan \u2014 and that deadline is next week. Boeing chief financial officer Brian West said Thursday that Boeing and the FAA have had \u201clots of dialogue\u201d including two check-ins during the preparation of the plan. \u201cThe engagement is constructive,\u201d he said at a conference organized by Wolfe Research on Thursday. \u201cI expect next week we\u2019re going to get some good feedback.\u201d FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said separately on Thursday that the plan is \u201cnot the end of the process, it\u2019s the beginning.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long road to get back to where they need to be making safe airplanes,\u201d Whitaker said in an interview on ABC News.

Meta created an AI advisory council that\u2019s composed entirely of White men Meta this week appointed a group of outside advisors to provide guidance on its artificial intelligence strategy. The four-person advisory group is composed entirely of White men, reports my colleague Clare Duffy. The tech giant said the group, which includes tech entrepreneurs and investors, will periodically consult with Meta\u2019s management \u201con strategic opportunities related to our technology and product roadmap.\u201d The move comes as Meta plans to invest tens of billions of dollars this year in AI infrastructure, research and product development. The council includes Patrick Collison, the co-founder and chief executive of financial technology company Stripe; Nat Friedman, the tech investor and former CEO of GitHub; Tobi L\u00fctke, the founder and CEO of online shopping firm Shopify; and Charlie Songhurst, the tech investor who formerly led corporate strategy and drove several key acquisitions at Microsoft. A Meta spokesperson confirmed the group will not be paid. Despite the group\u2019s significant combined experience, Meta is already taking heat for failing to include women or people of color \u2014 or anyone else outside of the wealthy, White, male, Silicon Valley mold \u2014 in a group advising one of the world\u2019s most powerful tech companies on a revolutionary new technology. The members of the group are also all in their 30s or 40s. The situation mirrors an incident last year at OpenAI when, in the wake of a leadership shakeup, it came under fire for appointing a board composed entirely of White men. Months later, OpenAI added three women directors to the board.

{"id": "2024_05_29_investing_graceland-scam", "text": "In yet another twist in the bizarre story of the dubious foreclosure threat against Elvis Presley\u2019s iconic Memphis home, a person purporting to be involved in a scheme to steal Graceland responded to an email from CNN, claiming responsibility for the scam. \u201cI didn\u2019t win this one. I\u2019ve stole (sic) many identities and received monies, we don\u2019t win all,\u201d wrote the self-proclaimed scammer in a mixture of English and Luganda, a language spoken by more than 5 million people primarily in Uganda, according to the United Nations. As with all scammers, it\u2019s unclear whether the person who emailed CNN is actually behind the scheme. But they responded to a CNN request for comment sent to an email address associated with Naussany Investments and Private Lending, a company that tried to foreclose on the famous mansion last week. Graceland was set to go up for auction under the pretext that the late singer\u2019s daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, who died in 2023, failed to pay back a $3.8 million loan she\u2019d secured from\u00a0 Naussany Investments before her passing, and had used Graceland as collateral, according to court documents. But actress Riley Keough, Elvis\u2019 granddaughter and heir, sued to protect the estate from the auction block, alleging fraud and saying Naussany didn\u2019t exist and had no rights to the property. The foreclosure sale was ultimately blocked, and Naussany Investments dropped its foreclosure efforts. A self-proclaimed scam artist CNN reached out to the email address listed as the company representative in Keough\u2019s lawsuit for comment. That person said his company had no claims against anyone affiliated with Graceland and directed CNN to a different email address \u2013 gregoryenaussanyniplflorida@hotmail.com \u2013 supposedly belonging to a person named Gregory Naussany, who responded when contacted by CNN. Other news outlets, including the New York Times, which first reported on the alleged scammer\u2019s admission Tuesday, received similar messages from the same email address. A Luganda-speaking native translated and reviewed the email for CNN. When asked whether the self-proclaimed scammer appeared to be a native speaker or was perhaps using a tool like Google Translate to pose as one, the translator found that while the apparent scammer knew the language, their writing style showed they were not entirely fluent. CNN has been unable to find any evidence to prove the company actually exists. The phone number listed in court documents was not in service. The business was listed in a court document as being located in Kimberling City, Missouri. But the secretary of state had no record of a business by that name when contacted by CNN. The Shelby County Registrar told CNN in an email that \u201cNaussany Investments & Private Lending, LLC, does not have any filings in the Office of the Shelby County Register of Deeds pertaining to Graceland/Elvis Presley.\u201d The self-identified scammer told the New York Times they are based in Nigeria and targeted groups including the dead and elderly. They especially went after victims in Florida and California, using sensitive documents like birth certificates to facilitate their schemes, according to the Times article. \u201cWe use innocents and we steal identity,\u201d said the scammer in an email to CNN. What would lead a scammer to go after the second most visited residence in the US behind the White House remains unknown. \u201cWe figure out how to steal,\u201d the scammer told the Times. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do.\u201d It was a mistake to target Graceland, said Mark Sunderman, a real estate professor at the University of Memphis. \u201cWhy they went after such a high-profile piece of property, that was just very stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, in terms of Memphis, I can\u2019t think of anything more high profile other than if they tried to go after the Civil Rights Museum.\u201d Court documents show Naussany Investments offered to settle its claimed debt with the Presley estate for $2.85 million, a reduction of $950,000 from the original loan.\u00a0 Sunderman believes that quick payoff may have been the scammer\u2019s goal, not a successful foreclosure on Graceland. \u201cIf they had gone through the foreclosure sale, they would have had much, much greater risk to get caught and had less payoff to them in the long run,\u201d he said. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti last Thursday said he was looking into possible fraud involving the matter.

{"id": "2024_05_29_tech_ransomware-attacks-hospitals-patients-danger", "text": "A ransomware attack on a major US hospital network that began three weeks ago is endangering patients\u2019 health as nurses are forced to manually enter prescription information and work without electronic health records, nurses at two hospitals affected by the cyberattack told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s putting patients\u2019 lives in danger,\u201d said a nurse who works at Ascension Providence Rochester Hospital, a 290-bed facility about 25 miles north of downtown Detroit. \u201cPeople have too many patients for what is safe. Nurses are taking on five or six patients dealing with all of this paper charting.\u201d Another nurse, who works who works at a 409-bed Ascension hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, told CNN: \u201cIt is frightening how many safety guardrails [have been] out of service without any computers.\u201d The nurses spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their jobs. The cyberattack hit Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit that oversees 140 hospitals across 19 states, on May 8, but the healthcare network is still working to bring its systems back online. Ransomware attacks that cut off access to electronic health records are a grimly regular occurrence in American life. The health care sector\u00a0reported\u00a0249 ransomware attacks to the FBI last year, more than any other sector, with some cases affecting patient records. But the Ascension incident is raising concerns about the threat to patient health posed by cybercriminals in a way that numerous other ransomware attacks on US health providers haven\u2019t, according to interviews with nurses and cybersecurity experts. The two Ascension nurses said in separate interviews that they felt overwhelmed by the abrupt shift to paper records following the cyberattack, underwhelmed by their hospitals\u2019 plans for dealing with the situation and worried that they or their colleagues will make mistakes entering a patient\u2019s vital medical information. \u201cI don\u2019t have any orders in the computer,\u201d the Rochester, Michigan-based nurse said. \u201cI can\u2019t see what labs are ordered and their results.\u201d OPEIU Local 40, a union that represents nurses at Ascension Providence Rochester Hospital, distributed an online\u00a0petition\u00a0on Friday saying union members were \u201cdeeply concerned about the current challenges faced by our healthcare professionals\u201d because of the cyberattack, and urged the hospital to take a series of remediating steps, including limiting the nurse-to-patient ratio. Mac Walker, Ascension\u2019s director of media relations, did not answer CNN\u2019s questions about the petition or the nurses\u2019 comments on patient safety. Instead, Walker emailed this statement on Wednesday morning. \u201cRestoring EHR [electronic health records] access has been among the top priorities of our recovery process,\u201d Walker said. \u201cDue to the hard work of our teams over the past several days, we have successfully restored EHR access in our first market and are actively progressing against a plan to restore access across our network on a rolling basis.\u201d Walker did not respond when asked what Ascension\u2019s \u201cfirst market\u201d meant. Ascension, the fourth largest hospital network in the country\u00a0by some measures, said in a public statement Friday that it has been working\u00a0\u201caround the clock with industry-leading cybersecurity experts to safely restore operations across our network.\u201d In the wake of the Ascension hack and another ransomware attack in February that disrupted insurance billing at pharmacies across the US, Biden administration officials say they\u00a0are preparing\u00a0to release a set of minimum cybersecurity requirements for US hospitals.\u00a0But the cybersecurity challenges in the health sector are legion and beyond the scope of any one policy prescription, experts say. Senior officials from the White House and Department of Health and Human Services plan to meet with cybersecurity executives from health care companies on Wednesday to discuss how to better protect hospitals from hackers, three sources familiar with the meeting told CNN. \u2018Exorbitant\u2019 wait times for lab results In statements to the press, Ascension has said that its staff are \u201cappropriately trained to maintain high quality care during downtime.\u201d But the nurses interviewed by CNN say that the shift to paper records and manual operations is taking a toll on hospital operations. With computers down, doctors have been writing paper prescriptions for patients that nurses take to a machine to manually enter without a cross-check from the local pharmacy, according to the two nurses. \u201cThey have to put an override in there to get the medication out,\u201d said Dina Carlisle, president of OPEIU Local 40. \u201cThere\u2019s no second safety check from the pharmacy.\u201d It has also taken an exorbitantly long time to get lab results because of the hack, the nurse in Birmingham, Alabama, told CNN. A \u201cstat lab,\u201d or lab work needed to make quick decisions on patient care, that normally takes 30 minutes to an hour to process has taken hours, the nurse said. A growing problem for hospitals Ransomware attacks in the US\u00a0routinely force hospitals\u00a0to divert ambulances and cancel appointments. That causes a strain on neighboring hospitals that pick up the slack. But a lack of clear public understanding of how cyberattacks on hospitals directly impact patient care is undercutting the urgency needed to deal with the problem, according to health advocates and cybersecurity experts. Researchers are increasingly quantifying how lethal ransomware can be. Roughly 3 in 100 hospitalized Medicare patients will die in the hospital under normal conditions, but during a ransomware attack, that number increases to 4 out of 100 because of the strain on hospital resources,\u00a0according\u00a0to scholars at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, who studied 374 ransomware attacks on health providers. Part of the problem,\u00a0experts say, is that some hospitals have failed basic tests of cybersecurity \u201chygiene,\u201d or sound defensive measures, while many small clinics lack the resources to secure themselves. And, perhaps more than any other sector, health care firms hold an enormous volume of sensitive data that is ripe for targeting and extortion schemes. The number of sensitive data records held by the health care sector grew by more than 63% last year \u201cfar surpassing any other industry and more than five times the global average,\u201d according to a study by security firm Rubrik. In February, cybercriminals broke into an unsecured computer server used by Change Healthcare, an insurance billing giant that processes about 15 billion health care transactions annually. The hack cut off health care providers from billions of dollars of revenue and snarled service at pharmacies across the US. Andrew Witty, the CEO of\u00a0UnitedHealth Group, which owns Change Healthcare,\u00a0apologized\u00a0in a recent congressional hearing for the security lapse and said he authorized a $22 million ransom payment to hackers to try to protect patient data. Yet a third of Americans could have had their data stolen in the hack, he said. \u201cWe routinely decline healthcare entities unwilling to address things like unpatched critical vulnerabilities, misconfigurations or uneven application of MFA [multi-factor authentication] \u2014 the very things hackers leverage to breach systems. And then we regularly see them breached later,\u201d Sezaneh Seymour, head of regulatory risk and policy at cyber insurance firm Coalition, told CNN. (She said her firm had no specific insights into the Change Healthcare or Ascension ransomware attacks.) Health care providers also make attractive targets for cyber extortionists because hospitals can ill-afford to be offline for long because of the disruptions it causes to operations. \u201cWhen we look at ransomware targeting, it\u2019s: who is the most easily targetable, who can afford little downtime and who has the highest willingness to pay,\u201d Bryan Vorndran, the FBI\u2019s senior most cyber-focused official, said in an interview. \u201cAnd where there\u2019s low-downtime environments, you have obviously a willingness to pay more so than in environments where they can afford downtime,\u201d Vorndran told CNN. \u201cI think all of that is relevant not just to the healthcare sector but to some other sectors as well.\u201d He declined to comment when asked about the Ascension hack.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/tech/ransomware-attacks-hospitals-patients-danger/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}

Shares of Marathon (MRO) were up more than 10% in premarket trade, while Conoco (COP) stock was down about 2%. The merger of the Houston-based rivals follows ExxonMobil\u2019s (XOM) $60 billion purchase of Pioneer and Chevron\u2019s (CVX) agreed takeover of Hess for $53 billion.

{"id": "2024_05_23_media_charles-barkley-tnt-nba-reliable-sources", "text": "The situation at\u00a0Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s TNT\u00a0network \u201csucks, plain and simple,\u201d\u00a0Charles Barkley\u00a0bluntly said Thursday. The former\u00a0NBA\u00a0star and\u00a0\u201cInside the NBA\u201d\u00a0co-host was speaking on\u00a0\u201cThe Dan Patrick Show\u201d\u00a0about the increasing likelihood that the network will soon lose the rights to air the league\u2019s games next year, a prospect that could mark the end of the beloved show on the\u00a0Turner\u00a0network. Barkley, who said he feels \u201cso bad for the people\u201d he works with, laid blame at the feet of the \u201cclowns\u201d atop WBD. \u201cThese people I work with, they screwed this thing up \u2014 clearly,\u201d Barkley unloaded. The host did little to hide his anger as he cited WBD boss\u00a0David Zaslav\u2019s\u00a0now-infamous 2022 comment that the company didn\u2019t \u201chave to have the NBA,\u201d suggesting the remark likely \u201cpissed\u201d off NBA commissioner\u00a0Adam Silver\u00a0and helped lead to the current situation. \u201cIt sucks for all of us,\u201d Barkley added. The uncertainty and fear voiced by Barkley comes as the NBA moves to renew its broadcast rights with media partners, seeking a significant increase in the cost to air the league\u2019s games. WBD, the parent company of CNN and the Turner networks, had an exclusive negotiating window with the NBA to renew its contract, but it expired last month without a deal, allowing other media companies to bid for the broadcast rights. Bloomberg\u2019s Lucas Shaw\u00a0reported Thursday night\u00a0that the NBA had asked WBD for $2.3 billion to secure the highly coveted rights, roughly $1 billion more than it reportedly pays under its current deal to air the games on TNT, its streaming service\u00a0Max, and other cable networks. During the negotiation, Zaslav \u201ctopped out around\u201d $2.1 billion, Shaw reported. \u201cThe league got up from the table and walked right into the arms of\u00a0Comcast\u00a0and\u00a0Amazon,\u201d Shaw wrote. NBCU, which appears poised to snatch the rights from WBD, offered $2.5 billion a year for the package of games,\u00a0The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Joe Flint,\u00a0Amol Sharma, and\u00a0Isabella Simonetti\u00a0first reported last month. The NBCU offer also includes airing the games on its broadcast network, something that WBD does not have, given that its linear television portfolio only includes cable channels. Wall Street has responded quite negatively to the possibility WBD, which has built a programming slate around the NBA, could lose the rights to air the games. When The WSJ first broke news about NBCU\u2019s bid, WBD\u2019s stock price plunged nearly 10% to an all-time low. The stock slightly recovered, but it is still hovering near historic lows, closing Thursday at $7.70 a share. Spokespeople for WBD and the NBA declined to comment on Thursday. But WBD executives have tried over the last several weeks to quell investor concerns. Zaslav said on a company earnings call that he remained \u201chopeful we will be able to reach an agreement that makes sense for both sides.\u201d While NBCU\u2019s bid far surpasses the current price WBD pays to air the games, WBD executives have repeatedly underscored that the company retains the right to match other offers, perhaps Amazon\u2019s. It\u2019s possible that Zaslav will be able to find another way to walk away from the intense negotiations with a deal for\u00a0some\u00a0games. But as the games slip out of WBD\u2019s hands, morale has taken an ugly hit at TNT, as evidenced by Barkley\u2019s candid comments. While WBD maintains the rights to the\u00a0NCAA March Madness\u00a0tournament, along with the\u00a0MLB,\u00a0NHL\u00a0and\u00a0NASCAR\u00a0\u2014 and\u00a0most recently\u00a0acquired\u00a0College Football Playoff\u00a0games from\u00a0ESPN\u00a0\u2014 the NBA remains crucial to the media conglomerate. It is, unquestionably, the crown jewel of WBD\u2019s sports portfolio. And TNT has built a programming slate around the NBA games, most notably the highly rated \u201cInside the NBA\u201d show. In fact, Barkley just signed a new, 10-year contract in 2023. Moreover, WBD struck a landmark deal with\u00a0Disney\u00a0and\u00a0Fox Corp.\u00a0earlier this year to launch\u00a0Venu, a forthcoming joint sports streamer. Losing the rights to NBA games could throw aspects of that business partnership into question. That\u2019s not to mention that WBD\u2019s flagship streaming service, Max, has been advertising live sports to consumers as a key differentiator from other platforms. Losing the NBA would be a big blow to that pitch. Gunnar Wiedenfels, WBD\u2019s chief financial officer, acknowledged this week at the\u00a0J.P. Morgan\u2019s\u00a0Technology, Media &\u00a0Communications\u00a0conference that \u201csports are a very important category\u201d for the company and it remains \u201cfully committed to a sports strategy.\u201d But Wiedenfels stressed the importance of financial restraint when inking such deals. \u201cWhat I also will say is we\u2019re always going to be disciplined,\u201d Wiedenfels said. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy with sports rights to burn a lot of money. And there\u2019s also an opportunity to to get your hands on some of the most emotional, most coveted products from an audience perspective. So, you\u2019ve got to be disciplined and think through all the scenarios.\u201d In other words, WBD is facing a major dilemma: Fork over much more to the NBA to try to match a deal on the table, or end the company\u2019s nearly-four decade relationship with the league.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/media/charles-barkley-tnt-nba-reliable-sources/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}

For employers: Stress civility and set guardrails Regardless of any one hot-button issue, it seems like US culture has become less civil over time. And many polarizing conversations are happening at work in ways they weren\u2019t years ago, according to SHRM, the leading human resources membership association. In response, it recently created a civility index. Its pulse survey of 1,600 employees in March, while not necessarily representative of all US workers, found that respondents rated their workplaces as more civil than everyday life, but they indicated that 39% of the incivility they witnessed or experienced happened at work. Incivility is defined as rude, berating or inconsiderate behavior, lack of manners, not keeping promises or failing to take accountability when you make a mistake. A majority (66%) said they agreed or strongly agreed that incivility reduces productivity, and more than half (59%) said that it hurts employee morale. Given the known frictions of this election year, HR experts urge employers to get out front of potentially heated moments in the coming months by setting expectations now as to what is and is not acceptable. \u201cAcknowledge there are tensions in the world and strong emotions on both sides of an issue. [Tell employees] \u2018We know this is happening and we know you have strong feelings about it,\u2019\u201d said Christy\u00a0Pruitt-Haynes, global head of the talent and performance practice at the NeuroLeadership Institute. But make clear the boundaries for exchanges. For example, Pruitt-Haynes said, you might say, \u201cEveryone is entitled to their opinion \u2013 but we won\u2019t tolerate personal attacks \u2013 verbal or physical \u2013 or talking down to someone if their opinion is different.\u201d Leaders may want to remind employees of the ways they can report inappropriate behavior if it does arise, said Oliver Brecht, vice president of Workplace Options Consulting Group. Any executive setting the guardrails should also abide by them. And ideally, private-sector leaders should try not to give any hint of their views on contentious issues, said HR consultant Cindy O\u2019Peka, who works primarily with small and mid-size employers. \u201cIt could create an us/them mentality at work. It\u2019s not a good team-building environment.\u201d For employees: How to keep your cool If you find yourself in a conversation with someone at work who raises political or social views that you flatly disagree with \u2013 or even find offensive \u2013 there are many ways to have a civil exchange or to politely disengage. Take a beat and breathe: Pay attention to how you\u2019re responding internally to what\u2019s being expressed. \u201cWhen we take a moment to label what we\u2019re actually feeling, we move our response from the emotional part of our brain to the logical part of our brain,\u201d Pruitt-Haynes said. Compartmentalize: Put your colleague\u2019s views in perspective. Do they really matter so much that you\u2019re willing to risk creating bad energy by trying to convince them that they\u2019re wrong? (That\u2019s usually a futile exercise, by the way.) \u201cDon\u2019t use it as a moment to combat and convince. \u2026 Recognize that while his opinion may be contrary to yours, what is the goal of being at work? Think long-term. You work for the same employer,\u201d Pruitt-Haynes said. Focus instead on what he offers of value to you. Say it\u2019s a form of expertise. \u201cCompartmentalize who he is. He is an expert \u2013 that\u2019s the part of him you\u2019re engaging with,\u201d she said. \u201cPivot the conversation back to what your relationship really is about \u2013 a professional one.\u201d Recognize social media\u2019s effect on people\u2019s views: If you or your colleague get a lot of information about events and issues through your social media accounts, your feeds are likely dictated by an algorithm that will highlight posts that either reinforce or influence your beliefs based on your past usage. \u201cPeople are being fed through their algorithm. All [we\u2019ve] been listening to is just one side of the argument,\u201d Brecht said. \u201cThat leads us to be less tolerable and aware of where the other person is coming from.\u201d When you have an exchange, keep it civil and educational: You don\u2019t have to agree with someone, but you can be genuinely curious about their views. And you can share how you came to yours. \u201cSpeak from your own experience,\u201d Brecht said. You can ask questions about theirs as well, with respect. Remember, too, he added, \u201cWe can disagree on something but that doesn\u2019t mean we disagree on everything.\u201d Deflect and de-escalate: If someone is ranting about an issue and you don\u2019t want to engage, simply change the focus, O\u2019Peka suggests. \u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018How is your puppy doing?\u2019 It disarms and redirects them.\u201d Of course, as is always the case at work, if someone says or does anything threatening or disrespectful, you should bring that to your manager or, if you\u2019re more comfortable, HR. But if a colleague simply expresses a view or displays support for a candidate on their clothes or at their workspace that you disagree with, it\u2019s not necessarily off-limits. It may come down to the policies in your employer\u2019s handbook regarding the dress code and other guidance on maintaining a cordial workplace, O\u2019Peka noted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/success/talking-politics-at-work-avoid/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_business_walgreens-price-cuts-retailer-inflation", "text": "Walgreens is joining other retailers in cutting prices across the board, from snacks to toiletries and even Squishmallows, in an effort to lure back inflation-weary shoppers turned off by high prices. Prices are dropping immediately on more than 1,500 items online and at its stores, which include both name and store brands, Walgreens announced Wednesday. In the past few weeks, competitors including Target, Walmart and Amazon slashed prices on thousands of household goods to rev up consumer spending. For example, an 80-count One A Day gummy vitamins jar now cost $11.99, down from $13.49 and the price of a bag of sour cream and onion potato chips from the Walgreens-owned Nice! brand now costs $1.99, down from $2.79. For kids, the price of a 16-inch Squishmallow plush has gone from $24.99 to $20. \u201cWalgreens understands our customers are under financial strain and struggle to purchase everyday essentials,\u201d said Tracey D. Brown, Walgreens\u2019 retail president and chief customer officer, in a release. \u201cWe continue to be committed to our customers by lowering prices on over a thousand additional items, something we\u2019ve been doing since October of 2023.\u201d Walgreens Boots Alliance\u2019s (WBA) most recent earnings report, released in March, revealed that the retailers\u2019 second-quarter sales beat expectations, but lowered its full-year earnings outlook because of a \u201cchallenging retail environment in the\u00a0US.\u201d Shares are down 40% year to date and its next earnings report isn\u2019t expected until June. Meanwhile, a host of other retailers report earnings Thursday, including Dollar General and Costco. Shoppers\u2019 savings A number of big retailers are lowering prices as they strive to pull consumers into stores and online to spend more freely on both essential purchases such as food and more discretionary purchases like new clothes, decorative items for the home, arts and\u00a0crafts or hobby kits. Retailers are feeling jittery after they hiked up prices as inflation spiked in recent years. But now, households aren\u2019t shopping like they used to, and high prices are forcing Americans to choose between wants and needs. In the game of chicken between stores and shoppers, it\u2019s the stores that finally appear to be yielding. That presents an ongoing challenge for the whole American economy, of which about two-thirds comes from consumer spending. Shoppers have pulled back for a year now as costs have risen 20% to 30% higher than they were three years ago and as incomes failed to keep up, said Sarah Wyeth, managing director, retail and consumer with S&P Global Ratings. This is making consumers across income levels look for deals. \u201cThere\u2019s just less dollars for consumers to spend,\u201d Wyeth said. The challenge for retailers now is to shake consumers out of that frugal mindset, she added. \u2013CNN\u2019s Parija Kavilanz contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/business/walgreens-price-cuts-retailer-inflation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_tech_meta-amazon-ai-fears-eu-law", "text": "Amazon and Meta executives told CNN this week that some of the fears about artificial intelligence are overblown and that the European Union\u2019s sweeping new AI rules risk holding back innovation. The EU gave the final green light to its AI act Tuesday, the same week tech leaders gathered in Paris for the annual VivaTech conference. The first-of-its-kind law is poised to reshape how firms and other organizations in Europe use AI for everything from health care decisions to policing. It imposes blanket bans on using the technology in ways deemed \u201cunacceptable\u201d \u2014 for example, for social scoring. The regulation also creates new disclosure obligations for large AI companies and requires more transparency on uses of AI considered \u201chigh-risk,\u201d such as for education and hiring. For Meta\u2019s (META) AI chief, Yann LeCun, \u201cthe big question\u201d about the new law is \u201cshould research and development in AI be regulated?\u201d \u201cThere are clauses in the EU AI act and various other places that do regulate research and development. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Anna Stewart at the Paris event. LeCun, widely known as one of the \u201cgodfathers of AI,\u201d disagrees with concerns that AI could soon surpass human intelligence. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s anywhere close,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that dangerous, frankly, certainly not today.\u201d AI systems might become a lot smarter in the future but then they will be designed with appropriate safeguards, he added. \u201cBut today, trying to figure out how to make future super-intelligent AI systems safe is like asking in 1925 \u2018how do we make jet transport safe?\u2019 And jet transport was not invented yet,\u201d he said. Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) chief technology officer Werner Vogels echoed concerns that AI regulation could stifle innovation in some areas. When thinking about risks, regulators should consider the application of the new technology to, for instance, health care and financial services differently from its use to summarize meetings, he told Stewart. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole range of areas where I think the risks are minimal and we should let innovation run there,\u201d he said. In other areas, where mistakes can have a bigger impact on people\u2019s lives, risks should be managed \u201cuniquely for that particular area.\u201d Vogels stressed that Amazon welcomes regulation, and is aligned with regulators in their overall goals, but warned the EU against overregulating AI, pointing to the example of its signature data privacy law, known as GDPR, which he described as a very \u201cthick\u201d book. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure that the regulatory requirements that we put in place, companies \u2014 not just the largest company but every company in Europe \u2014 can actually implement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make sure that innovation continues to happen and that the innovation doesn\u2019t just come outside Europe. We already have a very long history in Europe of underinvesting in R&D,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/tech/meta-amazon-ai-fears-eu-law/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result.

The Nationwide Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU) said on Wednesday during a press conference streamed on its official Youtube channel that its 28,000 members \u2014 just under a quarter of the company\u2019s total workforce in the country \u2014 would strike on June 7, following failed negotiations over pay and bonus arrangements. \u201cWe can no longer afford to see a company that has no will to negotiate,\u201d union representatives said, adding \u201cwe will fight for workers\u2019 rights and interests.\u201d Son Woomok, a union leader, told CNN that many NSEU members worked for Samsung\u2019s flagship semiconductor unit. \u201cWe are demanding transparent and fair performance bonuses and wage increases,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThere has never been a proper wage negotiation. It has always been carried out by announcing the (outcome) at the labor-management council, which does not include our union, and the company telling us to accept it,\u201d he added. In a statement to CNN, a Samsung spokesperson said: \u201cThe company remains committed to engaging in good faith negotiations with the union, and is making every sincere effort to come to an agreement.\u201d The world\u2019s biggest memory chipmaker has had a rough few years. A historic shortage\u00a0of computer chips during the Covid pandemic was followed by falling demand last year as consumer appetite for electronics remained weak because of global economic uncertainty. In January, Samsung reported an operating profit of just 6.567 trillion won ($4.8 billion) for 2023, its weakest annual performance since 2009, according to the Wall Street Journal. Samsung also lost its crown as the top smartphone maker globally. But things are looking up for the company because of  the AI boom. It is optimistic about a resurgence in demand for mobile devices this year, particularly with the rollout of new products, such as AI-powered smartphones. Last month, Samsung reported a more than 10-fold rise in first-quarter operating profit amid forecasts of high demand for AI and high-end chips, an area in which it competes with Intel (INTC) and Taiwan\u2019s TSMC. The vast majority of the world\u2019s advanced microchips are made in just two places: Taiwan and South Korea. Taiwan\u2019s industry is larger and more dominant, something South Korea is keen to challenge.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/tech/south-korea-samsung-union-strike-pay-negotiations-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_business_american-airlines-alleged-discrimination-black-male-passengers", "text": "A lawsuit filed Wednesday on behalf of three Black men alleges \u201cblatant and egregious race discrimination\u201d by American Airlines when they were removed from a flight. The suit alleges that the plaintiffs \u2013 Alvin Jackson, Emmanuel Jean Joseph and Xavier Veal \u2013 and five other Black male passengers were ejected from American Flight 832 from Phoenix to JFK in New York City on January 5, 2024, \u201cwithout any valid reason, based solely on their race,\u201d according to the complaint. An American Airlines representative approached each of the men before takeoff, the complaint said, ordering them off the plane. The passengers complied. \u201c(O)nce they reached the jet bridge, they saw that several other Black men were also being removed from the plane. In fact, it appeared to Plaintiffs that American had ordered all of the Black male passengers on Flight 832 off the plane,\u201d the complaint reads. American representatives told the men a complaint about body odor had prompted their removal, according to the suit. None of the plaintiffs were told that they personally had body odor, \u201cand in fact none of the Plaintiffs had offensive body odor,\u201d it says. At least one American representative agreed with the plaintiffs when they suggested that they had been singled out because they were Black, the suit alleges. Cell phone footage taken by some of the men and shared by the Public Citizen Litigation Group representing the plaintiffs shows a chaotic scene as they question the airline\u2019s actions and records one man saying, \u201cSo this is discrimination.\u201d \u201cI agree, I agree,\u201d says a woman wearing a badge who appears to be an airline employee. \u201cWe\u2019re the only ones getting taken off the plane,\u201d says one man, panning across the group. \u201cLook at us.\u201d In another video, a man comments, \u201cThis is crazy. Y\u2019all just took like eight Black people off the plane.\u201d The plaintiffs did not know each other before the flight and were not seated together, according to the complaint. At the gate, the men were told that a White male flight attendant had made the body odor complaint, the suit says. The men were eventually allowed back on after about an hour after the airline determined there were no available flights that evening. \u201cPlaintiffs then had to reboard the plane and endure the stares of the largely white passengers who viewed them as the cause of the substantial delay. They suffered during the entire flight home, and the entire incident was traumatic, upsetting, scary, humiliating, and degrading,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cWe take all claims of discrimination very seriously and want our customers to have a positive experience when they choose to fly with us,\u201d American Airlines said in a statement. \u201cOur teams are currently investigating the matter, as the claims do not reflect our core values or our purpose of caring for people.\u201d The plaintiffs are seeking \u201cdeclaratory relief, just compensation for their pain and suffering, a punitive damage award sufficient to deter American from discriminating against Black passengers in the future,\u201d as well as attorneys fees. The complaint also refers to what it calls \u201cAmerican\u2019s pattern of discriminating against Black passengers,\u201d which prompted an NAACP warning in 2017 related to the airline. That warning was lifted nine months later after the airline made progress in addressing the organization\u2019s concerns.

{"id": "2024_05_29_business_mackenzie-scott-philanthropy-nightcap", "text": "In her cameo in the 1996 comedy First Wives Club, Ivana Trump offers a witty post-divorce kernel of wisdom: \u201cDon\u2019t get mad, get everything.\u201d The 2024 version of that sentiment, at least among a certain class of billionaire women, might tack on an addendum: Get everything, and give it all away as fast as humanly possible. That\u2019s the way MacKenzie Scott, one of America\u2019s single largest philanthropists, has chosen to disburse the spoils of her divorce from Jeff Bezos in 2019. And it\u2019s a style that Melinda French Gates appears to be emulating, at least partly, in her newly solo philanthropic venture. On Tuesday, French Gates revealed in a New York Times essay that her first project after leaving the foundation she co-founded with her ex, Bill Gates, would focus on advancing women\u2019s rights around the world. French Gates said she is \u201cexperimenting with novel tactics\u201d such as doling out $20 million grants to 12 smart people and letting them do with it what they see fit. \u201cI\u2019m eager to see the landscape of funding opportunities through their eyes.\u201d That kind of unrestricted giving is uncommon in the traditionally bureaucratic realm of philanthropy. But it\u2019s not unheard of, and that\u2019s largely thanks to the way women generally, and Scott in particular, have taken a radical, trust-based approach to giving. \u201cI think it\u2019s been the bane of a lot of nonprofits\u2019 existence is that, if it\u2019s government grants, they have to comply with a lot of red tape to demonstrate that they\u2019re having an impact,\u201d Amir Pasic, the dean of the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, tells me. \u201cAnd I think a lot of philanthropies, especially the highly professional foundations kind of emulate that way of looking at things \u2014 they want you to know how to measure the impact that you\u2019re having \u2026 And nobody asks the nonprofits if these are even the appropriate impact measures.\u201d That\u2019s starting to change as more women control the direction of the billions getting disbursed. \u201cWomen tend to be more social in the way that they approach giving, and they\u2019re more collaborative,\u201d Pasic says, citing research from the Women\u2019s Philanthropy\u00a0Institute. Scott\u2019s style of giving \u2014 generous, unrestricted and consistently happening with zero fanfare around it \u2014 has been a notable departure from the more methodical, top-down approach of large charitable foundations, including the one French Gates co-founded. Now independent of that organization, French Gates is free to take bets on organizations and communities regardless of their size or ability to demonstrate their impact. Scott and French Gates\u2019 ex husbands, meanwhile, aren\u2019t getting as many kudos for their charitable work as they might like. Bezos has a history of hyping his big plans \u2014 just one of many sharp contrasts to Scott\u2019s charitable work \u2014  and told CNN in 2022 that he planned to give away the majority of his wealth (currently estimated at more than $200 billion). But Bezos has not signed the Giving Pledge, a popular way for the ultra-rich to declare their charitable intentions, and many of his big-ticket promises have come under scrutiny. Most recently, Bezos made a $100 million pledge to help rebuild Maui after last year\u2019s wildfires. But in January, Bloomberg reported that local officials and nonprofits on the island hadn\u2019t received any money from Bezos. Gates, with a net worth of $154 billion, has also faced criticism for the Gates Foundation\u2019s methods. \u201cGates\u2019s vast wealth could help the world in far-reaching ways, for example if it were redistributed as cash gifts to the poor,\u201d the journalist Tim Schwab recently wrote in The Nation. \u201cThat can\u2019t happen through the Gates Foundation\u2019s father-knows-best, look-at-me brand of bureaucratic philanthropy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/business/mackenzie-scott-philanthropy-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_tech_china-apple-sales-rebound-price-cuts-intl-hnk", "text": "A rebound in Apple\u2019s iPhone sales in China is gaining momentum, after the company aggressively cut prices in its largest overseas market to lure back consumers actively hunting bargains in a weak economy. Shipments of foreign-branded cell phones in China, the vast majority of which are iPhones, surged 52% in April to 3.489 million units, according to CNN calculations based on data released Tuesday by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT). The academy is a research firm under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, a regulatory body. The increase is a major acceleration from the 12% growth logged in March by foreign-branded smartphones, according to previous data from CAICT. The Global Times, a state-owned tabloid known for its patriotic views and promoting Chinese companies, has described the rebound as \u201cimpressive.\u201d Apple (AAPL) had a tough start to 2024 in China. In the first quarter, it lost the top spot in the country\u2019s smartphone market as shipments tumbled 19%, according to a report by Counterpoint Research. Apple took a hit from growing competition with local brands including Huawei, which saw sales increase nearly 70% in the same period because of the successful launch of its Mate 60 series. An economic slump, including worsening job and income prospects, has prompted Chinese consumers to tighten their belts and seek discounts on everything from food to cars. But iPhone sales started to bounce back in March after Apple and its retail partners slashed prices, according to CAICT data. The price-cutting intensified recently. Last week, Apple said it would slash prices on some of its smartphones on Tmall, an Amazon-like site owned by Alibaba (BABA), by as much as 23% until May 28. Similar reductions were made on JD.com, another major e-commerce site. The unprecedented discounts were part of a campaign launched during the annual \u201c618\u201d shopping festival, China\u2019s second-biggest online shopping bonanza of the year, which usually runs from late May to mid-June. After the discounts, the iPhone 15 is now in the same price range as smartphones made by Xiaomi and Huawei. The hefty reductions are \u201cthe only way\u201d for Apple to defend its market share in China, Jefferies analysts said earlier this week. \u201cWe believe Apple has created significant pricing pressure on the local brands,\u201d especially Huawei\u2019s flagship models, they said. That will help Apple regain its lost market share but is also likely to put pressure on its competitors to cut prices further. \u201cThe discounts on high-end models could extend into the third quarter of 2024, pressuring all smartphone (makers\u2019) margins,\u201d they added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/tech/china-apple-sales-rebound-price-cuts-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "business"}}
