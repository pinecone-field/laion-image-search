In the lawsuit, filed Sunday in New York state court, the president\u2019s sonaccuses Fox News of unjust enrichment, intentionally inflicting emotional distress, and violating New York civil rights laws. The lawsuit makes good on\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s threat he made in April that he would take the network to court if it didn\u2019t immediately issue retractions and corrections. The miniseries, \u201cThe Trial of Hunter Biden,\u201d was a six-part offering on the Fox Nation digital streaming network, and was also promoted on Fox News, the cable TV channel. It featured a dramatized \u201cmock trial\u201d about Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas financial dealings that led in part to his federal tax indictment and that also fueled House Republicans\u2019 struggling impeachment inquiry into his father. Fox News\u00a0took down the miniseries\u00a0in late April, one day after Hunter Biden threatened to file a lawsuit. But according to the lawsuit, promotional materials for the miniseries are still on some Fox News-linked social media pages, and the miniseries episodes are still circulating \u201conline and in the public domain.\u201d A Fox News spokesperson claimed the lawsuit was meritless and \u201centirely politically motivated,\u201d and said the network looks forward to \u201cvindicating our rights in court.\u201d \u201cThe core complaint stems from a 2022 streaming program that Mr. Biden did not complain about until sending a letter in late April 2024,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe program was removed within days of the letter, in an abundance of caution, but Hunter Biden is a public figure who has been the subject of multiple investigations and is now a convicted felon. Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden\u2019s own making.\u201d The new lawsuit claims Fox News \u201ctargeted Mr. (Hunter) Biden in an effort to harass, annoy, alarm, and humiliate him, and tarnish his reputation.\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s son is seeking an unspecified amount of punitive damages, as well as any profits that Fox reaped from the miniseries, and other corrective measures. \u201cThe miniseries is fictionalized; it is not a news event. It was made for the purpose of trade and advertising, and merely exploits Mr. Biden\u2019s name, image, and likeness for Fox\u2019s commercial benefit,\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers wrote in the lawsuit. Hunter Biden\u2019s team said in the lawsuit that without his consent, Fox News \u201cunlawfully published numerous intimate images (both still and video) of Mr. Biden depicting him in the nude, depicting an unclothed or exposed intimate part of him, as well as engaged in sex acts.\u201d The right-wing network said these images originated form Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0infamous laptop\u00a0\u2013 data from which was leaked by allies for former President Donald Trump in 2020. The president\u2019s son was\u00a0convicted at a trial\u00a0last month on federal gun charges, and faces a second trial this fall on alleged tax crimes. However, he hasn\u2019t been charged in connection with the bribery and foreign lobbying allegations that were at the center of Fox\u2019s \u201cmock trial\u201d series.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/media/hunter-biden-sues-fox-news/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_tech_google-wiz-acquisition", "text": "Google owner Alphabet is in advanced discussions to buy fast-growing cybersecurity startup Wiz for roughly $23 billion, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN. A takeover of Wiz, which makes cybersecurity software for cloud computing, would represent a major bet by Google on cybersecurity, marking the tech giant\u2019s biggest-ever acquisition. Discussions between Google and Wiz began after the startup raised $1 billion from venture capital investors earlier this year, the source said. Terms of a potential deal have not been finalized and talks could still collapse, according to the source. News of the Google-Wiz talks was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Neither Google nor Wiz returned CNN\u2019s requests for comment. The deal would easily surpass Google\u2019s purchase of Motorola for $12.5 billion about a decade ago, the biggest takeover in company history. Google offloaded Motorola just two years later for a massive loss. A $23 billion price tag on Wiz is nearly double the $12 billion valuation of the startup from its most recent round of funding. In March 2022, Alphabet bought cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion as part of its efforts to help companies better address cyber threats and bolster its cloud computing business. Google Cloud is central to the company\u2019s efforts to diversity revenue beyond its core search advertising business. Although its cloud sales have grown, it has struggled to compete with similar services from Microsoft\u00a0and Amazon. Buying Wiz would be a \u201cshot across the bow\u201d at Microsoft and Amazon, showing that Google is making a \u201cmajor bet on the cyber security space to complement its flagship offering in the cloud,\u201d Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at\u00a0Wedbush, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Cloud security has become especially important in recent years as companies have spent heavily to move data to cloud platforms. Just last week, AT&T revealed that nearly all of its wireless customers\u2019 call and text records were exposed in a massive breach caused by an \u201cillegal download\u201d on a third-party cloud platform. The Google-Wiz deal talks come despite intense antitrust scrutiny under the Biden administration of tech giants. However, that antitrust scrutiny could be dialed back somewhat if Trump once again takes hold of the White House, Ives said, making the Federal Trade Commission \u201cmuch weaker\u201d and sparking an \u201caccelerated merger and acquisition environment to take place for Big Tech.\u201d If the acquisition gets finalized and closes, it would mark a massive exit for Wiz and its founders \u2014 Assaf Rappaport, Ami Luttwak, Yinon Costica and Roy Reznik. The four executives met years ago when they were drafted into Unit 8200, the cyber intelligence division of the Israel Defense Forces. Since starting up in March 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, New York City-based Wiz has enjoyed explosive growth. Today, the company says 40% of Fortune 100 companies are its clients. Notable customers include BMW, Slack and Salesforce, and it works with major cloud companies including Amazon, Microsoft and Google.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/tech/google-wiz-acquisition/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_business_airbnb-hidden-camera-invs", "text": "It was another lawsuit brought by another victim whose fun-filled vacation turned into a voyeuristic nightmare: A woman was secretly recorded undressing at a rental property, her images stored on the computer of an alleged sexual predator accused of spying on unsuspecting renters for years. Airbnb, one of the world\u2019s largest short-term rental companies, had seen this sort of scenario before. Typically, the company seeks to settle hidden camera cases quickly and confidentially. But this one played out differently. An Airbnb representative testifying at a court-ordered deposition early last year offered a rare glimpse of the company\u2019s hidden camera problem: Airbnb has generated tens of thousands of customer support tickets related to surveillance devices in the last decade. During the hours-long deposition, the Airbnb employee also revealed that when a guest complains of a hidden camera, the company doesn\u2019t \u2013 as a matter of practice \u2013 notify law enforcement, not even when a child is involved. The company may, however, reach out to hosts about complaints as part of internal inquiries \u2013 a move law enforcement experts say could hinder criminal investigations because it gives suspects time to destroy evidence. A CNN investigation found that Airbnb consistently fails to protect its guests despite knowing hidden cameras are a persistent concern within its industry. Airbnb\u2019s corporate strategies, moreover, have been aimed at preventing regulation of the short-term rental market to allow the company to distance itself from responsibility for guest safety and privacy. Thousands of images have been recovered from short-term rental hosts by law enforcement. Hidden cameras placed in bedrooms and bathrooms show guests during their most private moments \u2013 changing clothes, being with their children, even having sex, according to CNN\u2019s review of court and police records, as well as interviews with nearly two dozen guests who found surveillance devices at short-term rental properties or were told by police they had been secretly recorded. Victims say they live under a shadow of fear that those private moments will become internet fodder. \u201cThis is not my Social Security number or my email address. This is my naked body,\u201d said one woman whose host secretly recorded her having sex with her husband at a cottage in Texas. Airbnb declined CNN\u2019s request for an interview. However, in a written statement, a spokesperson said that hidden camera complaints are rare, but when they do occur \u201cwe take appropriate, swift action, which can include removing hosts and listings that violate the policy.\u201d The spokesperson added that \u201cAirbnb\u2019s trust and safety policies lead the vacation rental industry and include background checks on US-based hosts and guests.\u201d CNN found that some of the policies touted by Airbnb come with significant disclaimers. The company\u2019s website, for example, tells users they should not rely on its background checks to identify \u201call past criminal convictions or sex offender registrations \u2026 or other red flags.\u201d And even if Airbnb discovers a user has a criminal background, convictions of \u201cmurder, terrorism, rape or child molestation\u201d are not automatic disqualifiers under the company\u2019s policy. \u2018The Wild West\u2019 Brian Chesky was unemployed when he and his roommate came up with the idea for Airbnb in 2007 while struggling to make rent in San Francisco. For $80 a night, they opened their home to three travelers, offering them air mattresses, breakfast and Wi-Fi. They called their start-up Air Bed and Breakfast. Thirteen years later, the company went public in the largest IPO of 2020, with a valuation of $47 billion. Today, Airbnb \u2013 which is valued higher than Hyatt Hotels Corporation and Marriott International combined \u2013 continues to chase the benefits of being an international hotel chain while shouldering few of the costs or responsibilities. Unlike hotels, Airbnb doesn\u2019t control the properties it advertises or employ on-site staff such as security guards, receptionists or cleaning professionals. Instead, it leaves the costs of maintaining and protecting short-term rentals to hosts. And, while hotels can be held legally responsible for guests harmed on their property, Airbnb frequently is not. In fact, Airbnb has fought against such liability in court, arguing it has little control over what happens at its listings \u2013 despite collecting roughly 17% of each booking. The multi-billion-dollar short-term rental industry paints a rosy picture with advertisements highlighting how home sharing improves human connection and offers intimate, private spaces for busy travelers. Still, violent crime and prostitution, as well as traveler deaths, have repeatedly forced Airbnb and its competitors into the international spotlight. One security concern, which has gone largely unchecked by Airbnb and the rest of the short-term rental market, is hidden cameras. Airbnb has known about the problem for at least a decade and has repeatedly notified its shareholders of the issue in annual reports since the company went public. \u201cWe were aware of it, there were an abundance of cases coming in,\u201d said one former Airbnb employee who asked to remain anonymous due to a non-disclosure agreement with the company. The employee, whose team dealt with safety and privacy issues, said hidden cameras were among the group\u2019s top concerns. Despite those concerns, the company for years allowed video surveillance by hosts in common areas, if the cameras were disclosed to guests. Chloe LeBrument, who traveled to London, Ontario, last summer with her fianc\u00e9 for a music festival, found a camera hidden in a charger in the bedroom at an Airbnb rental. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s many, many people that have left the room having no idea that \u2026 they had been recorded,\u201d said LeBrument, whose host has been criminally charged with voyeurism. LeBrument described feeling angry and disappointed by the experience. \u201cIt felt really gross,\u201d she said. In January, CNN began reaching out to former Airbnb employees to ask about hidden camera concerns within the industry. In early March, Saturday Night Live mocked how ubiquitous the issue is in a skit. Just over a week later, the company announced it would ban all indoor cameras as of April 30. The company said nothing about how it would force hosts to comply with the rules. \u201cYou can have all these great rules, but if no one\u2019s checking that the rules are being followed \u2026 it\u2019s still kind of the Wild West,\u201d said attorney Bianca Zuniga-Goldwater, who represents several hidden camera victims in suits against Airbnb and Vrbo. CNN reviewed more than a dozen police investigations and lawsuits across the US involving at least 75 victims and found Airbnb often moves swiftly to contain user complaints and resolve them out of court. One attorney told CNN that Airbnb settled during a phone call after she gave them a heads up that she was going to file a lawsuit on behalf of a guest who said they found a camera hidden in their room at an Airbnb rental. Airbnb seeks to compel complainants into arbitration, a process that hides cases from public view, according to six attorneys who represented clients in cases against the short-term rental platform. When a settlement is reached, Airbnb has required users to sign confidentiality agreements, which bar them from discussing details of the deal. Airbnb told CNN its use of arbitration and non-disclosure agreements are standard practices within the industry. One man, who was recorded having sex with his wife at an Airbnb rental and received a financial settlement from the company, said he felt \u201cdirty\u201d signing a confidentiality agreement. \u201cWe were gagged,\u201d he said. Last year\u2019s court-ordered deposition, which was part of an ongoing case against Airbnb and has not previously been reported, should have detailed the scope of the company\u2019s hidden camera problem. The company, through its representative, was supposed to comply with a court order to quantify how many complaints or reports had been made to Airbnb by people who had been recorded by surveillance devices since December 1, 2013. The Airbnb representative came to the table with a number. Her testimony revealed the company generated 35,000 customer support tickets about surveillance devices in the preceding decade. In the deposition, the Airbnb representative sought to downplay the significance of the number of tickets, testifying they could reflect instances such as a malfunctioning doorbell camera or a tablet with recording capabilities left out on a coffee table. The representative did not provide any statistics detailing the number of claims she suggested were innocuous among the 35,000 tickets. The Airbnb spokesperson told CNN that a single report could create multiple tickets. The company declined to specify how many unique complaints there have been. CNN reached out to more than 130 former employees who handled safety issues or fielded security concerns for Airbnb\u2019s support line. Of the 24 who responded, nearly half said they couldn\u2019t speak about their experience due to non-disclosure agreements with the company. The few who agreed to be interviewed said one of the most common concerns they heard came from guests who feared they were being surreptitiously recorded. \u201cI\u2019ve never received a call about a doorbell,\u201d one former employee said. \u2018The scariest moment of my life\u2019 in Comfort, Texas David Wyzynajtys and his girlfriend had never used Airbnb before booking a romantic weekend away in July 2021. When the couple spotted a remote property in Texas Hill Country with numerous positive reviews and a host who had earned Airbnb\u2019s coveted \u201csuperhost\u201d status, they booked it. But after the pair arrived at the cottage in Comfort, Texas, and changed for the night, Wyzynajtys noticed something that terrified him: a hidden camera plugged into the wall and pointed directly at the bed. \u201cThe scariest moment of my life,\u201d Wyzynajtys recalled. Wyzynajtys and his partner frantically left the property and drove nearly 10 miles down a dark, winding road to check into a hotel. Rattled, they reached out to Airbnb via a customer support chat feature asking that someone call them. No one did. Instead, the couple received an in-app chat message from Airbnb later that night. According to court records, an Airbnb representative sought permission to report their complaint to the host, a man named A. Jay Allee. \u201cDo you mind if we contact the host and get his side of the story?\u201d\u00a0Wyzynajtys recalled the Airbnb representative asking in the message. The couple was fearful of Allee \u2013 they worried he could have been watching them through a livestream as they discovered the device and hurried to leave. Wanting to avoid a confrontation, Wyzynajtys denied Airbnb\u2019s request. Wyzynajtys said Airbnb was \u201ctotally just negligent or didn\u2019t care about it at all.\u201d The next day, Wyzynajtys contacted law enforcement. Police obtained a search warrant and raided Allee\u2019s property, confiscating cell phones, computers, and the camera, which Allee had been using to record guests for much of a year. Among the more than 2,000 recovered images, law enforcement identified more than 30 victims, including several children. Many guests \u2013 who booked the same property either through Airbnb or Vrbo \u2013 were captured in various stages of undress. Some were recorded having sex. Allee was later charged with 15 counts of invasive visual recording and pleaded guilty to six of them. Thirteen people who stayed at Allee\u2019s cottage \u2013 including two minors \u2013 sued Airbnb in California state court in July 2022. Airbnb settled with the plaintiffs six months later. A suit against Vrbo, filed by three couples who stayed at Allee\u2019s property and were all recorded being intimate with their partners, is ongoing. Allee held Airbnb\u2019s superhost status. The rank, which is granted by the company\u2019s algorithm, provides higher visibility and earning potential, according to Airbnb\u2019s website. On Vrbo\u2019s platform, he was similarly designated as a \u201cpremier host.\u201d One of Allee\u2019s victims said that superhost status was one of the reasons he and his family had chosen the property for their weekend away. \u201cIt kind of infers that a lot of people have good experiences there,\u201d said the victim, who asked not to be named due to privacy concerns. Some victims who spoke to CNN left positive reviews for stays \u2013 thus feeding the algorithm for a host\u2019s elevated status \u2013 only to later learn from law enforcement they had been secretly recorded. \u201cThank you for sharing your beautiful ranch with us,\u201d one of Allee\u2019s victims, who was recorded having sex with his partner, wrote in a Vrbo review after their stay in 2020. \u201cWe had an amazing time for our anniversary. We enjoyed feeding the animals and sitting by the fire at night just enjoying the silence. We will stay here again!\u201d A Vrbo spokesperson noted the company prohibits any cameras that capture the inside of a property and that \u201ctrust and safety are part of Vrbo\u2019s legacy.\u201d Vrbo didn\u2019t respond to questions about Allee or its policies. Lt. Butch Matjeka of the Kendall County Sheriff\u2019s Office notified Airbnb of his investigation into Allee in October 2021, police records show. Almost two months later \u2013 and five months after Wyzynajtys found the camera \u2013 Allee\u2019s listing remained active on Airbnb\u2019s site, according to a lawsuit against the company. \u201cFrom a law enforcement perspective, if I tell you that I\u2019m investigating then you should stop hosting that individual on your site until the outcome of my investigation,\u201d Matjeka said. Regulations are \u2018bad for business\u2019 Earlier this year, lawmakers in the European Union agreed to groundbreaking regulations governing the short-term rental industry. The new rules will require host registration, data sharing by the company and quality control of listings. Airbnb hailed the regulations as a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for the industry and praised the EU-wide approach. Its public praise belies the fact that Airbnb has fought European cities for attempting to regulate the industry, said Kim van Sparrentak, a member of the European Parliament, who steered the legislation through the governing body. \u201cAirbnb is similar to other sharing economy companies \u2013 on a municipal level that means filing lawsuits as soon as any regulation is proposed,\u201d she said, referring to the company\u2019s strategy of fighting regulations in court. There are no similar federal regulations in the United States. Instead, local municipalities have been left to govern the fast-growing industry. In the cities that have been successful in introducing regulations \u2013 such as requiring hosts to register with local authorities \u2013 it has, at times, been difficult to get Airbnb to comply. Some of those regulations could assist with criminal investigations. When the city of New York enacted a law last year that requires hosts to register with the city and prohibits platforms from processing transactions for hosts that fail to comply, Airbnb responded by filing a lawsuit calling the measures \u201cextreme and oppressive\u201d and said the restrictions would cause the company \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s bad for business for them to follow regulations,\u201d said Murray Cox, who runs the nonprofit watchdog organization Inside Airbnb. Complying with rules, he said, often means excluding business from Airbnb\u2019s platform, which cuts into the company\u2019s bottom line. \u201cIt\u2019s about corporate greed.\u201d Airbnb\u2019s legal weapon of choice in its fight against regulations \u2013 and in at least one case against a guest who claimed she was injured while staying at an Airbnb rental \u2013 stems from a decades-old law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The law, often propped up as a defense by tech giants such as Facebook and X, states the platforms cannot be held responsible for user-posted content. But for Airbnb, the argument has not always been successful. The judge presiding over the New York case, for example, pointed out that this legal protection didn\u2019t apply to Airbnb because the company makes money on booking transactions. \u201cThey say that if you\u2019re going to participate in the transaction, then (Section 230) is off the table,\u201d said Cox. To Shannon Schott, a Florida-based attorney who settled with Airbnb after her client said he found a hidden camera at his rental, Airbnb\u2019s use of Section 230 should be concerning to users who value their privacy and safety. \u201cThey\u2019re not arguing: This didn\u2019t happen, your client isn\u2019t injured. They\u2019re arguing: We aren\u2019t responsible,\u201d Schott said. Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky, who has introduced legislation that aims to curb big technology companies\u2019 use of Section 230, argued that the platform would be safer if Airbnb were forced to take responsibility for what happens at its listings. Right now, Section 230 is used as a \u201cget out of jail free card,\u201d the Democratic lawmaker said. Broken promises Less than 20 miles from Airbnb\u2019s San Francisco headquarters, a 2019 Halloween party turned deadly at a rental property in California\u2019s wealthy Orinda community. People fled as shots rang out, and when the dust had  settled, five people were dead. The crime remains unsolved. The carnage prompted Airbnb to re-examine parts of its business model, cracking down on party homes and vowing to verify all listings and user identities. \u201cEvery home and every host on Airbnb will be reviewed with the objective of 100% verification\u201d by the end of 2020, Chesky, the company\u2019s CEO, promised after the shooting. In March, Airbnb disclosed only about 20% of its property listings worldwide had been verified. However, the company has boasted that every host, co-host and booking guest is identity-verified. That accomplishment comes with a big disclaimer: Its identity verification badge \u201cdoes not guarantee that someone is who they claim to be,\u201d the company\u2019s website states. Nor does Airbnb\u2019s identify verification process necessarily uncover a user\u2019s criminal history. Earlier this year, Airbnb guests in the outskirts of Melbourne, Australia, were shocked to learn their host, with whom they shared their rental home, was a registered sex offender. According to a local news report that reviewed the listing at the time, Airbnb had verified the identity of the host. However, the identification process didn\u2019t appear to surface the 11 charges of sexual assault on a mentally disabled person \u2013 for which the host spent more than four years in prison. Airbnb told the news outlet it suspended the host\u2019s account after it learned of the criminal conviction. Background checks appear to go beyond identity verification and involve searching public databases for users\u2019 information. The checks, which Airbnb says are conducted by a third party, could notify the company of users\u2019 criminal histories. However, the company makes no guarantees to perform them on every user worldwide. On its website, Airbnb says it may run a background check if it has at least a first name, last name and date of birth for US-based users who create listings. Still, the company warns travelers they shouldn\u2019t rely on its background checks to uncover all convictions, sex offender registrations or other red flags for its users. \u2018Digital content is forever\u2019 Allee was released from jail in February following a one-year sentence. His attorney didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Police identified more than 30 suspected victims who stayed at Allee\u2019s cottage but could only file charges in connection with 15. To some of those victims, his brief stint behind bars didn\u2019t suit the crime. \u201cLess than a month for every victim,\u201d said Wyzynajtys, the guest who found Allee\u2019s hidden camera. However, Allee\u2019s lenient sentence was not unusual. In most states, and on the federal level, video voyeurism is a misdemeanor, punishable by no more than a year behind bars. In 2022, Airbnb superhost Peter Madden pleaded guilty to seven counts of violation of privacy in connection with recording five guests at his property in Maine, according to the Cumberland County District Attorney. During an interview with police, Madden initially denied ownership of the camera, which was concealed in a clock radio and pointed at his guests\u2019 bed. Then, he said he put it there for security reasons. Ultimately, Madden, whose attorney didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment, admitted he\u2019d been recording guests engaged in sexual activity. \u201cThere\u2019s stuff of a couple of couples playing around or getting changed,\u201d he conceded when pressed by an officer about what images the camera captured. \u201cAre you a voyeur?\u201d the officer asked, according to a recording obtained by CNN. In response, Madden laughed. \u201cI\u2019m an artist,\u201d he said. \u201cI look at everything, I study everything.\u201d Madden served 14 days behind bars. Victims, on the other hand, suffer lengthier consequences. All of Allee\u2019s victims who spoke with CNN, seven in total, said they suffered long-term trauma due to Allee\u2019s actions. They also detailed the crippling fear that their images \u2013 or those of their kids \u2013 will one day end up online, if they haven\u2019t already. \u201cWhat is made into digital content is forever,\u201d said the woman who was secretly recorded having sex with her husband at Allee\u2019s cottage. An intensive care nurse who visited Allee\u2019s property at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic continues to suffer from \u201csocial distress around the personal nature of the recordings and the possibility that they will become public,\u201d according to the lawsuit she filed against Vrbo. Several images on Allee\u2019s computer showed the nurse undressed and being intimate with her husband. Others captured her infant son, police records show. Vrbo didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s inquiries about the case. One couple \u2013 who stayed there to celebrate an anniversary \u2013 said they felt \u201cshocked and appalled\u201d by the experience and worried that strangers had seen images of their private moments. One woman said she now takes medication to treat feelings of paranoia. \u201cIt\u2019s violating,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cWho knows where that footage went and who saw that?\u201d   Senior Investigative Correspondent: Kyung LahExecutive Producer: Patricia DiCarloManaging Editor: Matt LaitDeputy Managing Editor: Samira JafariVideo Producer: John GeneralSupervising Producer: Logan WhitesidePhoto Editor: Austin SteeleContributor: Yahya Abou-Ghazala", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/business/airbnb-hidden-camera-invs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_13_business_boeing-slap-on-wrist", "text": "Boeing faces up to $487 million in fines as part of its anticipated guilty plea to a felony charge related to two fatal crashes of the 737 Max. Critics of the deal, however, are calling it a \u201cslap on the wrist.\u201d While corporate guilty pleas by companies the size of Boeing are rare, and there are some terms of the plea agreement that Boeing leadership undoubtedly found onerous, the deal does show the limits of corporate criminal charges. Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a charge that it defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration, hiding crucial information about a design flaw on the 737 Max during its original certification process. That design flaw has been tied to crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people, plunging the company into a crisis that led to $32 billion in losses. \u201cThe Justice Department does no one any favors by trying to sell this as a tough deal,\u201d said Peter Goeltz, a former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board and now a CNN contributor who consults for transportation companies. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t smell like a tough deal.\u201d Under the plea settlement reached late Sunday, a $243 million fine that Boeing agreed to pay back in 2021 could be doubled to $487 million. \u201cThat\u2019s what, the price of three 777\u2019s?\u201d Goeltz said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s a significant fine.\u201d There are some other numbers backing Goeltz up. Before the losses started in 2019, the company was reporting record annual revenue of $101 billion and record core operating profit of $10.7 billion, or 21 times the cost of of the $487 million fine. While Boeing\u2019s credit rating is now at risk of falling into the junk bond status for the first time, credit rating agency Moody\u2019s came out with a statement Monday that the plea and penalties \u201cwill have little effect on Boeing\u2019s finances or operations.\u201d And Boeing nearly escaped even this slap on the wrist. In January a door plug blew off a 737 Max approaching 16,000 feet. While no one was killed or seriously injured on that Alaska Airlines flight, the incident not only brought unwanted attention and a slew of federal investigations, it upended an agreement Boeing reached in January 2021 with the Justice Department to end the risk of prosecution for defrauding the FAA during the Max certification. The Alaska Air incident happened just days before the probationary period would have ended. Getting off cheap The expected guilty plea did little to satisfy family members of the crash victims,\u00a0who branded it a \u201csweetheart deal,\u201d an \u201catrocious abomination\u201d and a gross \u201cmiscarriage of justice.\u201d Their attorneys had argued that Boeing should have been hit with a maximum fine worth as much as $24.8 billion, which they calculated based on a multiple of their estimate of combined losses sustained by the families. Other corporations that pleaded guilty to felonies have agreed to much larger fines. Oil giant\u00a0BP agreed to pay $4 billion\u00a0to settle criminal charges, including manslaughter, related to the explosion and oil spill at its Deepwater Horizon oil platform in 2010 that killed 11 workers. Volkswagen pleaded guilty to three US felony criminal charges and agreed to\u00a0pay $2.8 billion in criminal penalties in 2017 after it admitted to cheating on its diesel emissions tests. \u201cThe fact that this is in the millions of dollars rather than billions is an indication this is a slap on the wrist,\u201d said Paul Cassell, a University of Utah law professor who worked on the BP case on behalf of victims and is now working for the families in the Boeing crashes. One of the facts angering family members is that Boeing agreed to plead guilty to simply defrauding the FAA, rather than facing manslaughter charges for the deaths of hundreds of people. \u201cThat\u2019s a tougher case to prove, but I believe the evidence was there,\u201d said Mark Lindquist, another attorney representing family members, as well as some passengers aboard the Alaska Air flight. \u201cAs a practical matter, the result might not have been a lot different\u201d if there had been manslaughter rather than fraud charges in this criminal case, Lindquist said. \u201cFrom a philosophical basis, it would have felt more like accountability and justice for the victims\u2019 families.\u201d Why no executives are facing charges But while the Justice Department announced in January of 2021 that \u201cmisleading statements, half-truths, and omissions communicated by Boeing employees to the FAA\u201d played a direct role in the crashes, it has taken only limited criminal action against any individual employee, and none against the top executives who oversaw the company\u2019s decisions at that time. The Justice Department said in a press statement early Monday that the agreement included \u201cno immunity to any individual employees, including corporate executives, for any conduct.\u201d But of the two former Boeing employees cited in the original settlement of the case in 2021, only one, Mark Forkner, the chief technical pilot at Boeing at the time, ever faced criminal charges, and he was eventually acquitted after his attorney convinced the jury that he was being made a scapegoat. \u201cAs a practical matter, individuals are more sympathetic to jurors than companies,\u201d Lindquist said. \u201cDOJ made a prosecutorial decision to pursue the company rather than individuals.\u201d There are also defenses in an individual\u2019s criminal case that are not possible in a corporate criminal case. \u201cWith an individual, there\u2019s always someone else he or she can point the finger at,\u201d said Lindquist. Boeing attorneys had it as part of their mission to make sure that its executives did not face any criminal charges, Lindquist said. \u201cFrom the beginning, that\u2019s been clear,\u201d he said. A Boeing spokesman said the company had no comment about the anticipated guilty plea or the case beyond a brief statement confirming the agreement. Another way to make executives pay Even if there are no criminal charges brought against executives, they can face significant penalties, Arlen said. That could come in the form of \u201cclawbacks,\u201d in which Boeing demands executives return bonuses they received during the time the misconduct was committed. \u201cEnsuring that the individuals are held accountable is the most important thing,\u201d she said. But so far the Boeing board has shown little indication of wanting to hold executives financially responsible. It recently gave CEO Dave Calhoun a 45% raise, taking his pay from $22.6 million to $32.8 million for 2023. His predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, lost the CEO job at the end of 2019 without any severance but left the company with a package of stock worth about $80 million at that time. Asked about possible clawbacks, Boeing pointed to company policy, which states in part: \u201cThe board shall have the discretion\u2026 to recover incentive-based compensation paid to any executive of the company who has engaged in fraud, bribery, or illegal acts\u2026 or knowingly failed to report such acts of an employee over whom such officer had direct supervisory responsibility.\u201d But despite that language, no clawbacks have occurred. Arlen said it would also be justified for compensation for board members to be clawed back. While Calhoun was not an executive during this time, he was on the Boeing board, receiving more than $300,000 a year while the certification process for the Max was taking place. \u201cAt the end of the day, when you have a company with systemic problems, the ultimate buck stops with the board,\u201d she said. Why Boeing will keep its government contracts The most serious penalty that Boeing could face is by far the least likely \u2013 it could be barred from federal government contracts due to its guilty plea. And that could conceivably force the company out of business: US government contracts accounted for 37% of its revenue in 2023, or about $29 billion, according to company filings. But while it will need to get waivers from the government to continue its contracts, everyone expects those waivers will be granted. Most of those contracts are with Boeing\u2019s defense and space business, not its commercial aircraft unit. Asked about the Department of Defense contracts, Pentagon spokesperson Air Force Major General Patrick Ryder told reporters Monday that \u201cDOD will assess the company\u2019s remediation plans and agreement with the Department of Justice to make a determination as to what steps are necessary and appropriate to protect the federal government.\u201d But the US government has few alternatives than sticking with Boeing, despite both the expected guilty plea and the years of quality issues. Beyond the lack of alternatives, few if any decision makers in the federal government want to see Boeing go out of business. It remains the nation\u2019s largest exporter, and has nearly 150,000 US employees. The company estimates its economic impact at $79 billion, supporting 1.6 million direct and indirect jobs at more than 9,900 suppliers spread across all 50 states. And it is crucial to the smooth operation of the nation\u2019s air travel system. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear to me Boeing is going survive this,\u201d said Robert Clifford, another lawyer for family members of crash victims. \u201cWhy is Boeing getting a pass that other criminal defendants do not? Because they\u2019re Boeing.\u201d \u2013 CNN\u2019s Natasha Bertrand contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/business/boeing-slap-on-wrist/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_success_how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges", "text": "Long before you take your high schooler on college campus tours, consider this: Shopping for college shouldn\u2019t be any different than shopping for a home.\u00a0When you want to buy a home, you come up with a range of how much you can afford and get pre-qualified for a mortgage. Then you look in neighborhoods that offer homes that meet your family\u2019s needs and fall within your price range. \u201cAdopt a mindset that we\u2019re buying college like we\u2019re buying a house,\u201d said Beth Walker, author of \u201cBuying College Better\u201d and \u201cNever Pay Retail for College.\u201d As a financial adviser and certified\u00a0college planning specialist, Walker tries to help families avoid a situation that many find themselves in at the 11th hour: Their child applies \u2014 and gets into \u2014 schools they cannot afford because the schools won\u2019t give them enough aid. And then they just \u2026 try to make it work, no matter how much debt is involved for the parents or the student. Instead, she advises families to start as early as 9th or 10th grade in figuring out what is affordable for them as a family \u2014 so parents don\u2019t sacrifice their own financial welfare and the future college student doesn\u2019t drown in debt upon graduation. And second, she recommends assessing how a child\u2019s talents and interests pare with majors and careers they might want to pursue. Doing both those things can help you target the right colleges to apply to. Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners, defines the perfect college as one \u201cwhere a student can go be happy, safe and successful, graduate in four years or less with a marketable degree and little or no debt.\u201d In helping families align parents\u2019 affordability constraints with their student\u2019s academic and social needs, he cautions them not to automatically assume the Ivys or other high-prestige schools will be best simply because of their status. And he stresses what success in life looks like after college and notes that an Ivy League degree isn\u2019t the only path to achieving it, especially if your child won\u2019t get much aid to attend. In fact, said Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, a lot of brand-name schools don\u2019t even offer merit-based aid, only need-based. So if you\u2019re not rich, but you make too much to qualify for need-based aid, you could find yourself having to cover the entire cost of tuition, room and board every year, which is pushing $90,000 at some US colleges. Set up financial guardrails well before the college search Fothergill created a free calculator called CostHero that lets parents assess what financial resources they will have available to pay for a child\u2019s college education. It then provides a range of affordability: At the low end is the number representing what they can pay if they don\u2019t take on debt. And at the high end is the number they can pay if they also take out an unsubsidized federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). \u201cIf you\u2019re not in a position to write a check for $90,000 a year, put up guardrails for yourself so you don\u2019t blow up your retirement,\u201d he said. The calculator inputs let you set the amount of resources you\u2019re willing to use to pay for college from your income and savings, your child\u2019s earnings from summer jobs, any family gifts, and any federal Stafford loans your child may take. It also factors in if you qualify for the federal American Opportunity Tax Credit. That credit, for qualified educational expenses, will reduce your tax bill or increase any refund you have coming. The calculator also gives you a debt-to-income score like the kind a mortgage lender might use to assess whether you\u2019re a good credit risk. Ideally, he said, you don\u2019t want your housing costs to exceed 36% of your gross income and your total debt \u2014 including debt from housing, cars, credit cards and any parental education loans \u2014 to exceed 43%. If your DTI ratio is close to or higher than 43% that is a sign you could get yourself into trouble if you end up having any financial problems while your child is in college, Fothergill said. \u201cIf folks have a way to determine the range of affordability prior to the onset of the college search, the outcomes are a lot better.\u00a0 For example, if one knows that the range of affordability is between $30,000 [a year] with no parent debt and $50,000 with parent debt, then any college that comes in with a net cost in that range is, by definition, affordable,\u201d Fothergill said. Net cost refers to the true cost of attendance after figuring out how much aid your child may get (e.g., grants and scholarships). Figure out where your student may qualify for the most aid Generally speaking, the biggest tuition discounts go to the most academically accomplished students in an incoming class. \u201cThe student needs to be in the top 25% of those admitted,\u201d Walker said. Getting into that top 25% cohort is based on SAT or ACT scores, and having a high, unweighted GPA based on a rigorous high school curriculum. The curriculum\u2019s academic rigor can be further bolstered by taking AP courses. Since your child is more likely to make the top quartile at some schools than others, Fothergill and Walker both recommend your child focus on applying only to those schools in which they stand the best chances of being in that top group to maximize their chances for merit-based aid. Otherwise, you\u2018ll spend money to apply to guidance-counselor-recommended \u201csafety\u201d schools or \u201creach\u201d schools with no sense if those places are affordable to you should your child get in. Using reported data from admissions officers about their key criteria in admitting an incoming class and based on what more than 1,000 schools report about the qualifications they used to grant aid, Fothergill created another tool called ListHero. It gives students a score that helps gauge\u00a0how competitive their profile is\u00a0at a given school, relative to others admitted, and by extension their eligibility for tuition discounts. Right now the tool is only available to college planning professionals for a fee. But Fothergill plans to create a free mini-version for consumers to use. For parents doing their own research on test scores, GPA requirements, costs and aid, he recommends checking the Department of Education College Scorecard, the site CollegeData.com and the College Board. Other ways to reduce college costs before applying While your children are in high school they can take other steps to reduce the total cost of their education. One way is by doing well on the PSAT to qualify to compete for a National Merit Scholarship. Another is to take AP courses. If their high school doesn\u2019t offer them, there is a program called Freshman Year for Free offered by the Modern States Education Alliance. It provides free AP placement courses and pays the fee for students to take the AP tests or college-level preparation (CLEP) tests administered through the College Board. Getting the minimum AP scores a college requires to earn a college credit will lower how much you ultimately have to spend on tuition. A third option is to see if your state has a program that offers a year of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to a state university from which your child could earn their degree. Or, if you plan to go to any other college, make sure the school will accept the credits from a community college course you plan to take. No matter what steps you take, starting the research and budgeting process early can save everyone a lot of stress, debt and potential heartache in the end. Said Walker: \u201cWe have to be a lot more intentional about this purchase.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/success/how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_media_biden-mental-fitness", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s White House repeatedly and aggressively shot down reports\u00a0on\u00a0the president\u2019s age and any possible limitations\u00a0on his ability to perform all the duties of his office. But after his shaky debate performance last week, in which Biden routinely struggled to\u00a0get his point across, some in the White House press corps say they wish they had pushed harder to tell the story. In June, when the Wall Street Journal published a\u00a0lengthy piece\u00a0on President Joe Biden\u2019s mental\u00a0state, the newspaper\u00a0got\u00a0slammed.\u00a0The White House, its allies, and\u00a0some in the media\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources\u00a0\u2013\u00a0criticized the Journal for quoting mostly Republican political foes on the record, who had a clear political motive to damage Biden\u2019s image. No Democrats were quoted on the record making those allegations, and several Democrats complained their on-the-record quotes praising Biden\u2019s sharpness were not included. The\u00a0Journal defended its reporting at the time. Last week\u2019s debate on CNN laid bare many of the concerns the Journal\u2019s reporting had raised \u2013 that the president has good days and bad days but can sometimes seem to slip up. A New York Times report on Tuesday raised similar concerns by those who have recently been in the room with Biden. The Times reported Biden has more frequent \u201clapses,\u201d although at other times he appears sharp. After Biden\u2019s lackluster performance last week, some are questioning whether the White House press corps dropped the ball on fully covering Biden\u2019s limitations. Biden\u2019s\u00a0age issue is not secret or new. Nearly every media outlet has reported on\u00a0growing concerns about\u00a0Biden\u2019s age well before the debate. The White House in the past has complained that the coverage is disproportionate, and that the media is spending more time covering Biden\u2019s age than his accomplishments as president versus former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies. The media has faced accusations that it has not covered Biden\u2019s mental fitness more aggressively because it wants to prop up the campaign in some way \u2013 an accusation the White House reporters CNN spoke to denied. Several White House reporters\u00a0told CNN that\u00a0the\u00a0coverage\u00a0of Biden\u2019s age and his mental stamina\u00a0should have\u00a0pushed harder. They cited several difficulties in doing so before the debate \u2013 from the obvious political motivations of sources who either want to protect Biden\u2019s image or project a certain image, to the blowback from pursuing such reports, especially from the White House and Democrats. A difficult task Like all past presidents, Biden has good days and bad days. It\u00a0can be tricky to report on something as difficult to define as a person aging, when his opponent\u00a0is a convicted felon, who regularly lies and has threatened to use the government to go after his political opponents. Still, some reporters said the press corps\u00a0could\u00a0have done a better job\u00a0covering\u00a0Biden\u2019s physical and mental state. The failure of the media, one White House reporter said,\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0pushing more aggressively\u00a0into Biden\u2019s abilities after the release of the Robert Hurr report in February, which called Biden a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d Biden\u2019s age was also a right-wing talking point for years, something the White House was quick to point out to reporters,\u00a0which\u00a0may have inadvertently turned off any serious investigation. For example, deceptively edited clips of Biden from the G7 spread widely by right-wing media figures were made to seem as though he was aimlessly \u201cwandering off\u201d from fellow world leaders when really, he was speaking to parachutists who had just landed during a demonstration. \u201cThe right-wing media was calling him senile from day one, and that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cThen whenever you report on the age you were in some ways solidifying, giving credence to some people that were actually of bad faith.\u201d All the White House reporters who spoke to CNN for this piece chose to speak anonymously so they could speak more freely about their relationship with the White House. Keeping the president at a distance Reporters said the White House has not made the press corps\u2019 job easy:\u00a0The White House has put up guardrails around Biden, they say, and\u00a0he does not engage in as many interviews or planned press conferences\u00a0as previous presidents. At those events,\u00a0the press might be able to gauge how he\u2019s doing on the spot, without prepared remarks. \u201cThey keep him at arm\u2019s length, and he rarely does extended interviews,\u201d the reporter said of the White House,\u00a0although he acknowledged Biden has started giving more interviews as of late. Biden has done fewer interviews and formal press conferences than his most recent predecessors, according to data compiled by\u00a0Martha Joynt Kumar,\u00a0professor emerita of political science at Towson University who chronicles the presidents\u2019 interactions with the press. But on quick and informal interactions with the press, like shouted questions on the way to his helicopter or plane, Biden\u00a0as of this week has had 588 interactions, Kumar reports, second only to Trump when compared to recent presidents. But those interactions are not the same as an extended press conference, reporters noted. On Tuesday, ABC News announced Biden would sit down with George Stephanopoulos for an interview, his first since the debate. The White House press shop has also been very \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cfairly successful\u201d in mitigating coverage of concerns over the president\u2019s age,\u00a0said\u00a0another White House reporter who works for a different publication. \u201c[B]erating reporters who bring them reporting about age concerns, bemoaning that it\u2019s all anyone writes about (clearly, it\u2019s not) and often attacking pieces after they run,\u201d the reporter told CNN. \u201cI think that\u2019s left some folks to conclude that these stories are too painful to report or that they should pick their spots more. It\u2019s clear the age stories that have angered the White House (and the liberal Twittersphere) the most.\u201d Alex Thompson, a White House reporter for Axios, said on CNN the day after the debate that \u201cthe White House\u2019s response every single time\u00a0it\u00a0has come up for three-and-a-half years has been to deflect, to gaslight, to not tell the truth \u2013 not just to reporters, not just to other Democrats, but even at times to themselves about the president\u2019s limitations at his age.\u201d Still, this White House\u2019s recent conduct with reporters pales in comparison to Trump\u2019s team, which has done everything from revoking press access to reporters they disagree with, to calling reporters the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d The White House declined to comment. Aging doesn\u2019t happen all at once Aging is also not a sudden moment.\u00a0That makes it trickier to report on. \u201cTo some extent, the decline has appeared to be gradual \u2014 hard to notice from day to day \u2014 and that\u2019s perhaps made it harder for reporters to determine when is the right moment to write something,\u201d one of the reporters said. Just a few days before the debate, Biden held a press conference at the G7 alongside Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelensky that passed off without anything of note in Biden\u2019s demeanor. But reporters pointed out (and have published stories noting) that the president has been using teleprompters at most big events, even fundraisers where in the past he might not have. He has also started to use the lower stairs to board Air Force One. Last year, The New York Times published a lengthy piece on the \u201ccomplicated reality of America\u2019s oldest president,\u201d which looked at some of those accommodations and concerns for his age, but also the moments where he showed stamina and vigor. Some reporters said that there has been a distinct change\u00a0within the last year, and that the press corps should have reported more aggressively on the accommodations made for the president. \u201cI think the press, most of the White House press, did suffer from a bit of lack of curiosity,\u201d one of the reporters said. Look who you\u2019re up against Biden\u2019s allies will often question coverage of the president\u2019s age, questioning why reporters focus on the president\u2019s age and mental lucidity and not on Trump\u2019s\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who, at 78,\u00a0was observed falling asleep during his hush money trial, has made his own major verbal flubs and bizarre statements, and regularly spouts complete falsehoods. \u201cIt makes sense to reflect on this now and ask whether we missed or, really, under-reported the story of Biden\u2019s age and decline. But it\u2019s complicated,\u201d one of the reporters said. \u201cThe fact that the political alternative to Biden is an authoritarian who sparked an insurrection and is a convicted felon does not mean that the press is failing American democracy to focus on Biden\u2019s obvious frailty.\u201d One of the reporters said the media can, and do, report on both. Biden\u2019s allies, however, say too much attention is placed on Biden\u2019s age and not on the threat Trump could pose to American democracy. But the reporters say they can, and should, do both. \u201cJust because you are reporting on Biden age, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not reporting on Trump\u2019s lies.\u00a0 I find that argument silly, and it seems one design towards like producing a certain outcome in the election, rather than like an honest reporting,\u201d one of the reporters said. The outlets that had received harsh blowback for their previous reports on Biden\u2019s lucidity now feel justified. A source familiar with the staff behind the Wall Street Journal\u2019s report said that when the piece first published, the reporters were approached by people with sympathy asking how they\u2019re doing \u201cas if something terrible had just happened,\u201d the source said. After the debate, the reporters started to get messages saying they were right.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/media/biden-mental-fitness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

NBC announced on Wednesday it will use AI software to recreate Michaels\u2019 voice to deliver daily recaps of the Summer Games for subscribers of its Peacock streaming platform, a milestone for the use of AI by a major media company. The use of an AI voice for the Olympics comes as the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, sound and text. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries, such as journalism, about how artificial intelligence can \u2013 or even should \u2013 be used. A new tool, called \u201cYour Daily Olympic Recap on Peacock,\u201d will enable 10-minute highlights packages, which can include events updates, athlete back stories and other related content personalized by subscriber preferences. The company said the highlights could be packaged in about 7 million different ways, pulled from 5,000 hours of live coverage in Paris, effectively making AI (the artificial intelligence, not the man) a significantly more efficient way to deliver personalized recaps.  \u201cWhen I was approached about this, I was skeptical but obviously curious,\u201d Michaels said in a press release. \u201cThen I saw a demonstration detailing what they had in mind. I said, \u2018I\u2019m in.\u2019\u201d A NBC spokesperson told CNN Michaels is being compensated for his involvement.

He\u2019s also known for his work on previous Olympics Games broadcasts for both NBC and ABC and for calling the Miracle on Ice Game at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. NBC said the AI system was trained using prior NBC broadcast audio from Michaels. The company said a team of NBC Sports editors will review all of the content, including audio and clips, to make sure everything is factually accurate and names are pronounced correctly.

The company\u00a0blamed\u00a0an \u201cillegal download\u201d on a third-party cloud platform that it learned about in April \u2014 just as AT&T was grappling with an\u00a0unrelated major data leak. AT&T listed approximately 110 million wireless subscribers as of the end of 2022.\u00a0Here\u2019s what that means for the millions of Americans that use AT&T\u2019s cellular service. What\u2019s at risk Hackers did not get any names, addresses or Social Security numbers. What they did get is metadata \u2014 call logs that contain a record of every number AT&T customers called or texted (including customers of other wireless networks), the number of times they interacted and the call duration. A cybercriminal could now identify relationships among phone numbers, a useful data point for hackers trying to make their scams more believable. For example, a hacker could see that a customer is in constant contact with a big bank\u2019s line and could send a phishing attempt posing as the bank. The hacker could text the customer saying, \u201cThis is Bank of America. We have some suspicious activity on your account. Click this link to review the charges, or call this number,\u201d said John Dwyer, director of security research at Binary Defense, a cybersecurity solutions firm. Or the hacker could pose as someone the customer has a personal relationship with, like a friend or family member. The age of artificial intelligence makes this even more pressing, according to Collin Walke, cybersecurity and data privacy partner at Hall Estill. \u201cOnce they know who you\u2019ve been communicating with, it allows deep fakes and those sorts of hacks to occur much easier,\u201d Walke said. Some customers\u2019 cell tower ID numbers were also exposed, which could help some bad actors track down geolocations, Walke said. That could also make these hacking attempts more believable. What customers should do Cellphone users should always be careful about phishing and other scam attempts, especially as hackers become more and more sophisticated. But AT&T customers should be hypersensitive to phone calls and text messages where they\u2019re being asked to do things like call a number, click a link or transfer money. That includes requests from what appears to be a number that you normally communicate with, Dwyer said. \u201cIf someone calls or texts you and asks you to do something, make sure you call them back to verify that it\u2019s actually them,\u201d Dwyer said. Of course, without stricter cybersecurity regulation, there isn\u2019t much customers can do to protect against data breaches. That responsibility lies with the federal government and giant telecom companies, which experts say widely go unchecked. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have an expectation that everyday Americans should be on the front lines of defending themselves for making sure the businesses they interact with have mandatory minimum cybersecurity in place,\u201d Eric Noonan, CEO of cybersecurity provider CyberSheath said.

{"id": "business_economy_transgender-americans-economy", "text": "Quinn Merriss, an 18-year-old who identifies as transgender and non-binary, barely makes ends meet. Merriss was kicked out of their home after years of tension and arguments with their parents over being transgender. They now live independently without any financial support from relatives, working as a server earning $5.50 an hour plus tips. \u201cI\u2019m living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d Merriss, who lives in an apartment in Cincinnati, told CNN. They manage to scrape by thanks to a housing assistance program, Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Merriss\u2019 plight illustrates the harsh economic realities of millions of Americans who identify as transgender and/or non-binary. The evidence from research and surveys is unmistakable: People whose gender identity does not match their sex at birth are more likely to experience financial hardships than the general population. (Some transgender people identify as \u201cnon-binary,\u201d which means they don\u2019t conform to one particular gender.) They deal with \u201clower employment rates, lower household incomes, higher rates of poverty, greater public assistance use, and increased likelihood of food insecurity,\u201d a 2022 study found. There are at least 5.3 million individuals who identify as transgender and/or non-binary in the United States, about the size of the Phoenix metropolitan area, according to the Pew Research Center. In interviews with CNN, economists, researchers and transgender people themselves say \u201ctransphobia,\u201d or negative beliefs and attitudes about trans people, is to blame. Transitioning genders can also cost tens of thousands of dollars, and being in the closet is well documented to take a toll on mental health. What the statistics show The dire economic straits of transgender and non-binary people hasn\u2019t been explored for very long, though much has been uncovered in recent decades. \u201cWe know that transgender people have been experiencing so many economic disparities ever since there has been data collected on them, going back 30 or 40 years,\u201d said Kevin Nadal, a distinguished professor of psychology at City University of New York\u2019s Graduate Center. \u201cIf you see a trans person and they make you feel uncomfortable, that\u2019s because you either haven\u2019t been exposed to them much before or because you have very rigid ideas about gender,\u201d Nadal said. Pew has also found that most Americans believe that a person\u2019s gender is determined by their sex at birth, but favor protecting them from discrimination. The United States Transgender Survey, conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality, is releasing full results from \u201can unprecedented\u201d 92,329 respondents later this year, its latest iteration since the previous survey in 2015. A preliminary analysis showed that living and working conditions remain as tough as ever. More than a third of transgender people surveyed (34%) said they were experiencing poverty, and 30% said they\u2019ve been homeless at least once in their lives. The unemployment rate among the transgender people surveyed was 18%, more than four times the current national rate. The Census Bureau puts the poverty line for a single person at $14,880 in 2022, the year of the survey. The pivotal role of family support A person\u2019s family plays a crucial role in their financial health, economists say, even with something as simple as providing shelter in adolescence or early adulthood. That safety net is often non-existent for transgender people. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot about how you start out in life,\u201d said Jody Herman, senior scholar of public policy at the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that trans people who had been kicked out of their homes or had family rejection experiences were more likely to be in an unstable economic position.\u201d Jay Woodman, a 29-year-old transgender man, fled his immediate family in Greenville, South Carolina, about six years ago with his partner, Alexander Taylor. The couple is currently living with Taylor\u2019s parents in southern Maryland. Woodman said he has \u201cno contact\u201d with any of his relatives after it became clear they don\u2019t support his gender identity. \u201cUnless you have financial help in some way from parents, grandparents or friends, forget about buying a house in this area,\u201d Woodman said. \u201c(Alexander) and I were even priced out of a trailer community with how bad our financial situation was a few short years ago, when he was a full time office assistant and music instructor and I worked a part-time minimum wage food service job because it was all I could get at the time.\u201d The US housing market has been notoriously tough for years, with rents rising faster than incomes and home prices recently soaring to a record high as mortgage rates remain painfully elevated. First-time buyers often receive financial assistance from family to purchase a home, according to a realtor.com survey. Many parents also help pay for higher education. Research shows that\u2019s simply not the case for most transgender and non-binary people. Merriss said they dream of attending college but have put that on hold to work full time. Disrespect while on the job is par for the course Sarah Elizabeth Isbell, 62, began to transition from male to female in 2000, eventually getting gender reassignment surgery in 2008. Isbell currently works in an administrative support role at a nonprofit organization, but she holds a law degree from the University of Oklahoma. Isbell said she worked at a civil rights law firm in the late 2000s, after she already began to transition, but got fired shortly after a humiliating incident at the workplace. \u201cI showed up to work one day wearing sandals with my toes painted red and I got ridiculed by the boss, a female boss, in front of the whole office at lunch,\u201d Isbell said. \u201cShe said \u2018Would you go to court that way?\u2019 and when I said that I don\u2019t see an issue\u2026 She just let into me relentlessly about how men can\u2019t dress like that.\u201d \u201cThat was really mortifying,\u201d she added. Isbell said she has struggled to find another job as a lawyer. \u201cI did civil rights law. But after my transition, even my civll rights lawyer friends didn\u2019t want to hire me. I kept being told that juries and clients with cases in front of juries won\u2019t accept a transgender trial lawyer,\u201d she said. in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in a landmark civil rights case that employers are prohibited from discriminating against LGBTQ employees. The case before the nation\u2019s highest court, Bostock v. Clayton County, was a consolidation of three similar cases around the country. One of them was brought by Aimee Stephens, who came out as a transgender woman in 2013 while working as a funeral director in a suburb near Detroit. She informed her employer in a letter that she would be coming in dressed as a woman and was fired shortly after, which led to Stephens\u2019 lawsuit. Stephens passed away a month before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. \u201cTrans folks have been protected (at the workplace) under federal law for four years now, but it\u2019s not clear how well that\u2019s working,\u201d Michael Martell, an economics professor at Bard College, told CNN. \u201cTrans people face stigma throughout their lives, so it\u2019s certainly fair to say that labor market discrimination is a contributing factor to their disadvantages in life.\u201d The early report of the US Transgender Survey showed that 11% of respondents said they had been fired, forced to resign or been laid off because of their gender identity or expression. And transgender people say they still deal with disrespect while on the job. A common issue for transgender people is being misgendered, or referred to with terms that don\u2019t reflect their chosen gender identity, which is sometimes done by accident and other times purposefully. Merriss, Woodman and Isbell all said they\u2019ve been misgendered at the workplace. A wave of anti-transgender bills across states A historic wave of bills in state legislatures across the nation aims to ban access to gender-affirming health care for transgender youth and regulate curricula in public schools, including discussions on gender identity. Last year, there were at least 510 anti-LGBTQ bills introduced by lawmakers in various states, most of them controlled by Republicans, according to American Civil Liberties Union data. That set a record and was nearly three times the number of similar bills introduced in 2022. More than two-thirds of the 167 anti-LGBTQ bills introduced last year related to health care were aimed at blocking trans minors from getting gender-affirming care. According to Trans Legislation Tracker, 40 anti-trans state bills have so far been signed into law this year, in addition to eight that have been passed by lawmakers but haven\u2019t been approved or vetoed by a governor yet. Despite the economic struggles and hostile political landscape across the country, researchers and transgender people say that being your authentic self is invaluable. An overwhelming 94% of respondents in the latest US Transgender Survey said they \u201creported that they were either \u2018a lot more satisfied\u2019 or \u2018a little more satisfied\u2019 with their life\u201d after transitioning genders. \u201cIt\u2019s awful some days, but I would not give up being this way,\u201d Merriss said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten away from the family toxic environment, and it\u2019s been so helpful seeing celebrities and characters in media being portrayed positively as a trans person.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/economy/transgender-americans-economy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_media_social-media-assassination-conspiracy-theories", "text": "Saturday\u2019s shooting at a Donald Trump rally was the first assassination attempt of a US presidential candidate in the age of social media \u2013 and\u00a0the former president had barely been hit before the internet was abuzz with all sorts of unsubstantiated explanations for what had, or had not, occurred. The moments of uncertainty created an information void that was quickly filled by speculation, misinformation and conspiracy theories. At the same time, the social media industry has broadly retreated from efforts to clamp down on misinformation. That retrenchment left the door wide open for false and misleading claims by both Trump supporters and opponents. The ease at which false rumors and conspiracy theories rapidly spread on social media threatens the public\u2019s ability to sort truth from fiction. It sometimes influences their behavior and further divides an already fractured America. The deluge of disinformation surrounding the Trump shooting shows, once again, that this problem isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. With less than four months until Election Day, the leading social media platforms appear resigned to let the status quo fester. Conspiracy theories spread wildly Almost immediately after Trump was injured during a shooting at a Butler, Pennsylvania, rally Saturday evening, a conspiracy theory emerged that the assassination attempt had been \u201cstaged\u201d \u2013 that Trump and his campaign had set it up to orchestrate the iconic photos of a resolute Trump surviving an attempt on his life. The term \u201cstaged\u201d began trending on X as soon as an hour after the shooting. The incident was not staged. The US Secret Service has now described it as an assassination attempt and the Department of Homeland Security has acknowledged it as a \u201cfailure\u201d of security. Still, on Monday, the false claim continued to circulate. \u201cI mean it\u2019s a little weird that this is America, and shooters don\u2019t miss unless they are hired to,\u201d a TikTok user with almost 4 million followers said in a video posted over the weekend, before going on to falsely suggest the Secret Service were involved in staging the shooting. By Monday the video had been viewed more than 8 million times, and \u201cliked\u201d more than 1.2 million times. To bolster the \u201cstaged\u201d conspiracy theory, an image began to circulate that had been altered to make it look like one of the Secret Service agents who rushed to Trump\u2019s aid was smiling during the incident. An influential anti-Trump X user who has almost 250,000 followers on the platform shared the image with the message, \u201cEveryone here seems to be having a good time, laughing and smiling for the cameras.\u201d The image was soon debunked by the fact-checking organization Lead Stories, which said it was a digitally manipulated version of an Associated Press image. \u201cThe officers cannot be seen smiling with their teeth as seen in the original, nor in any other news outlets photos of the event,\u201d Lead Stories explained in a blog post. Some prominent Trump supporters, meanwhile, posted their own conspiracy theories. Some suggested, without evidence, that the shooting had occurred because of deliberate negligence on the part of the Secret Service. Others, including elected Republican lawmakers, falsely tried to suggest President Joe Biden or his administration had some role in the attempted assassination. One X user with almost 3 million followers posted a video of the deceased shooter and wrote, \u201cRough day for this CIA officer\u201d \u2013 a baseless insinuation that the intelligence agency had a role in the attempted assassination. Biden has ordered a review of the Secret Service\u2019s\u00a0security protocols in light of the assassination attempt, and the agency has pledged to cooperate with all investigations. Consequences for inaction The reasons people share conspiracy theories are varied. Some do so in a cynical attempt to undermine or attack people who do not share their political point of view. Others get in on the act for social media clout \u2013 viral posts can translate into dollars for some online influencers. Social media companies including Meta, YouTube, TikTok and X didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The enormous temptation to share false claims is being actively rewarded by platforms such as X, formerly Twitter, where owner Elon Musk has made multiple interlocking decisions around account verification, payments to creators, and whom to allow on the platform that have facilitated a noisier and less trustworthy information ecosystem, misinformation researchers have long said. Musk partook in the proliferation of misleading material, sharing a post Sunday that claimed mainstream media outlets were peddling \u201cpure propaganda\u201d about the shooting. As evidence of supposedly biased coverage, Musk cherry-picked some of the earliest press reports about the incident, which referred to \u201cloud noises\u201d and \u201cpopping noises\u201d at the rally. Those were carefully worded initial bulletins that were later updated to reflect that a \u201cshooting\u201d had indeed taken place. But the Trump shooting and its aftermath may be an even bigger indictment of Meta\u2019s decision this year to stop promoting news, politics and social issues in its curated content feeds. At the time, the move was seen as potentially helpful for preventing users from going down algorithmically recommended rabbit holes, but it also triggered predictions that the policy could pose problems during an election year. Saturday\u2019s shooting has vividly illustrated the consequences of that decision, as users expressed frustration that mentions of the incident could not immediately be found on Threads, in direct contrast to X where conspiratorial thinking was flowing freely. The Verge reported Saturday that Meta did appear to be surfacing news reports about the shooting in Facebook search results, and that it inconsistently showed conspiracy-related content at the top of its trending topic on Threads for the incident. Meta\u2019s move to stop amplifying news in user feeds may be the right one for shareholders as executives have come to view moderating that type of content as an unsustainable business cost, said Laura Edelson, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University and the co-director of Cybersecurity for Democracy, a research group focused on digital misinformation. But it may have come at the cost of society writ large. \u201cWhat this leads to is, on Threads, there\u2019s just not very much of either authoritative news or non-authoritative news compared to other platforms because of the nature of the algorithm,\u201d Edelson said. \u201cAnd then people just switch over to other platforms where they can get stuff, and so like on Twitter, there\u2019s a bunch of crazy conspiracy theories getting actively recommended by the Twitter algorithm.\u201d TikTok is also currently a major vector for misinformation about the shooting, Edelson added, because the app\u2019s algorithm promotes content \u201cabout the things that people are asking about, even if they do it in a really irresponsible way.\u201d Meta\u2019s decision to pull back from promoting credible news content in feeds, along with the constant press of unverified and misleading claims on other social media platforms and the comparatively slow drip of confirmed reporting from major news outlets, all appear to have combined to create the perfect conditions for a misinformation maelstrom. The situation calls for more rigorous regulation of social media, Edelson said, but it also offers a lesson for mainstream journalists: Don\u2019t just report what we do know, but also report the outstanding unanswered questions so that the public won\u2019t fill in the gaps with junk information. News outlets \u201cshould be running stories about, \u2018Here are the questions people have, and here\u2019s how we\u2019re trying to find out about them.\u2019 \u2026. Maybe people don\u2019t like to read those stories, but if you don\u2019t write those stories, then what people will do is they will just scroll down one more video to someone who\u2019s going to speculate about how this guy was probably, like, fed information by the FBI.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sean Lyngaas contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/media/social-media-assassination-conspiracy-theories/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

Microsoft took a\u00a0non-voting, observer position\u00a0on OpenAI\u2019s board in November last year after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took back the reins of the company, which operates the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT. The seat meant it could attend OpenAI\u2019s board meetings and access confidential information but had no voting rights on matters including electing or choosing directors. The observer seat and Microsoft\u2019s more than $10 billion investment in OpenAI have triggered unease among antitrust watchdogs in Europe, Britain and the US over how much control it exerts over OpenAI. Microsoft cited OpenAI\u2019s new partnerships, innovation and growing customer base since Altman\u2019s return to the startup for giving up its observer seat. \u201cOver the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company\u2019s direction.

{"id": "trump-supporters-blame-media", "text": "Moments after\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0was rushed to safety following a failed assassination attempt at a Saturday night rally, some of his supporters turned toward the press pen with obscenities as they fingered reporters for blame. \u201cThis is your fault!\u201d one attendee emphatically yelled, pointing at individual journalists as he approached the fence line separating them from attendees. \u201cThis is your fault!\u201d \u201cIt is your fault!\u201d exclaimed another. Axios\u00a0reporter\u00a0Sophia\u00a0Cai, who quoted some in the crowd warning the press, \u201cyou\u2019re next\u201d and that their \u201ctime is coming,\u201d\u00a0even reported that\u00a0a few rally goers tried to breach the barriers establishing the press pen, but that they were stopped by security personnel. In the immediate wake of the horrific shooting attempt on Trump\u2019s life, which resulted in the tragic death of one rally attendee and the severe wounding of two others, the news media has quickly emerged among some Trump supporters as a body to assign blame. While the Trump campaign urged its staff to \u201ccondemn all forms of violence\u201d and said it \u201cwill not tolerate dangerous rhetoric on social media,\u201d some of the former president\u2019s supporters in\u00a0MAGA Media\u00a0vehemently assailed the press for its hard-knuckled reporting on Trump, which has sounded the alarm on what four more years under the former president would look like. Over the course of the campaign cycle, news organizations have, among other things, reported at length on Trump\u2019s plans to warp the federal government for his own ends, including to seek vengeance against his political opponents. That reporting is now facing scrutiny, with some Trump supporters blaming it for producing a charged atmosphere that gave way to the assassination attempt, while mostly looking past the incendiary rhetoric of the former president himself. Immediately after the attack, top figures across the news media condemned the shooting, underscoring that violence against a political candidate is an attack on democracy itself. Top liberal commentators also expressed their disgust in strong terms.\u00a0MSNBC\u2019s\u00a0Rachel Maddow, the country\u2019s most recognized liberal personality, said she did not \u201chave adequate words to describe how disgusted and horrified\u201d she was. \u201cThere is no *no* *no* *no* violent solution to any American political conflict,\u201d Maddow\u00a0wrote on Threads. \u201cI am grateful the former president is going to be ok, and miserably sad and angry about the other people hurt and killed. This is a very dark day.\u201d The reaction from the press and liberal media figures stood in stark contrast to how right-wing media personalities have responded in the aftermath of attacks on Democrats. Instead of raising the volume or fanning the flames of false flag conspiracy theories, which top figures on the right have done after attacks on\u00a0Paul Pelosi\u00a0and\u00a0Gabrielle Giffords, they urged for calm. Nevertheless, the anti-press attitude in MAGA circles has unquestionably increased. Despite the accuracy of the news media\u2019s reporting on Trump, supporters of the former president have moved to vilify and scapegoat journalists for the heinous attack, sending anti-media attitudes to alarming heights. \u201cOn a daily basis, MSNBC tells its audience that Trump is a threat to democracy, an authoritarian in waiting, and a would-be dictator if no one stops him,\u201d conservative radio host\u00a0Erick Erickson\u00a0wrote on X. \u201cWhat did they think would happen?\u201d Donald Trump Jr.\u00a0blasted\u00a0CNN,\u00a0The Washington Post, and the press at large for recent coverage of his father. \u201cDems and their friends in the media knew exactly what they were doing with the \u2018literally Hitler\u2019 bullshit!,\u201d he wrote on X. With just over 100 days until the November elections, the inflamed disposition toward the press has prompted cause for concern among news executives and spurred discussion inside newsrooms about safety and security precautions \u2014 especially with the\u00a0Republican National Convention\u00a0set to start on Monday. That four-day event, which was already a security concern prior to the assassination attempt, will bring together scores of journalists, alongside thousands of Trump supporters. \u201cJournalists are always among the very first to run towards a crisis, and we collectively are working in overdrive to keep everyone safe,\u201d one news executive told me. \u201cThat is the absolute top priority.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/trump-supporters-blame-media/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

The CFPB said it was imposing penalties on the bank for illegally charging customers for unnecessary auto insurance policies. It estimates the practice harmed more than 35,000 customers and resulted in vehicle repossession for more than 1,000 of them. \u201cFifth Third Bank demanded borrowers pay for coverage they did not need or else face delinquency, additional fees and repossessions,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cFifth Third Bank conducted repossessions of vehicles when the delinquency was caused by the bank charging unnecessary and duplicative coverage.\u201d The bank, which is based in Cincinnati, Ohio, operates branches in 12 states, primarily in the Midwest and Southeast.

{"id": "2024_07_12_business_att-customers-massive-breach", "text": "The call and text message records from mid-to-late 2022 of tens of millions of AT&T cellphone customers and many non-AT&T customers were exposed in a massive data breach, the telecom company revealed Friday. AT&T said the compromised data includes the telephone numbers of \u201cnearly all\u201d of its cellular customers and the customers of wireless providers that use its network between May 1, 2022 and October 31, 2022. The stolen logs also contain a record of every number AT&T customers called or texted \u2013 including customers of other wireless networks \u2013 the number of times they interacted, and the call duration. Importantly, AT&T said the stolen data did not include the contents of calls and text messages nor the time of those communications. The records of a \u201cvery small number\u201d of customers from January 2, 2023, were also implicated, AT&T said. \u201cWe have an ongoing investigation into the AT&T breach and we\u2019re coordinating with our law enforcement partners,\u201d the FCC said on social media platform X. The company\u00a0blamed\u00a0an \u201cillegal download\u201d on a third-party cloud platform that it learned about in April \u2013 just as the company was grappling with an\u00a0unrelated major data leak. AT&T says that the exposed data is not believed to be publicly available, however CNN was unable to independently verify that assertion. AT&T spokesperson Alex Byers told CNN that this was an entirely new incident that had \u201cno connection in any way\u201d to another incident disclosed in March. At that time, AT&T said personal information such as Social Security numbers on 73 million current and former customers was released onto the dark web. \u201cWe sincerely regret this incident occurred and remain committed to protecting the information in our care,\u201d the company said in a statement about the latest breach. AT&T listed approximately 110 million wireless subscribers as of the end of 2022. AT&T said international calls were not included in the stolen data, with the exception of calls to Canada. The breach also included AT&T landline customers who interacted with those cell numbers. AT&T said that contents of the calls or texts, personal information such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or customer names were not exposed in this incident, however the company acknowledged that publicly available tools can often link names with specific phone numbers. Additionally, AT&T said that for an undisclosed subset of its records, one or more cell site identification numbers linked to the calls and texts were also exposed. Such data could reveal the broad geographic location of one or more of the parties. AT&T believes that at least one person involved in the cybercriminal incident is in custody, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The FBI declined to comment when asked about that statement. AT&T promised to notify current and former customers whose information was involved and provide them resources to protect their information. Usage details such as the time of calls and text messages were not compromised either. But AT&T spokesperson Byers told CNN that the number of calls and text messages, and total call durations for specific days or months were exposed. That means the data would not identify precisely when one phone number called another but could reveal how often two parties called each other \u2013 and how long they spoke for \u2013 on specific days. AT&T said it learned on April 19 that a \u201cthreat actor claimed to have unlawfully accessed and copied AT&T call logs.\u201d The company said it \u201cimmediately\u201d hired experts and a subsequent investigation determined hackers had exfiltrated files between April 14 and April 25. Justice Department delays public disclosure The company said the US Department of Justice Department determined in May and in June that a delay in public disclosure was warranted. The FBI said AT&T reached out shortly after learning about the hack, but the agency wanted to review the data for potential national security or public safety risks. \u201cIn assessing the nature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to public reporting\u2026 due to potential risks to national security and/or public safety,\u201d the FBI said in a statement. \u201cAT&T, FBI, and DOJ worked collaboratively through the first and second delay process, all while sharing key threat intelligence to bolster FBI investigative equities and to assist AT&T\u2019s incident response work.\u201d This appears to be the first cyber incident in which the Justice Department has asked a company to delay filing a disclosure with the SEC because of potential national security or public safety concerns. \u201cThis is very concerning. This information is very valuable to cyber criminals and to nation-states,\u201d Sanaz Yashar, co-founder and CEO of cybersecurity firm Zafran, told CNN. Yashar, previously an Israeli cyber spy, said threat actors can correlate the cell ID data with other information readily available to pinpoint where someone works \u2013 including at sensitive locations like the White House and Pentagon. \u201cYou don\u2019t need the timestamp. If someone is there everyday, you can understand they work there and their routine. This is very secret information and a way that spies do stuff.\u201d Justin Sherman, founder of Global Cyber Strategies, a consultancy, also put the potential threat in stark terms. \u201cMetadata about who\u2019s communicating with who, at massive scale, enables someone to map connections between people \u2014 think journalists and sources, intelligence officers and their contacts, married people and those with whom they\u2019re having an affair,\u201d Sherman told CNN. Jason Hogg, a former FBI special agent who is now executive-in-residence at Great Hill Partners, said the cell site data is \u201cquite significant because it could allow bad actors to determine certain consumers\u2019 geolocation, which could be used to make the social engineering attacks more believable.\u201d AT&T shares fell 1% on Friday following the news. In the new incident, AT&T told CNN it learned in April that customer data was illegally downloaded from its workspace on Snowflake, a third-party cloud platform. AT&T is only the latest major company to have data stolen via access to their Snowflake platform. Ticketmaster and Santander Bank have also recently disclosed massive data breaches linked to Snowflake. Mandiant, a Google-owned cybersecurity firm, has notified at least 165 organizations that they may have been affected by the hacking spree. Mandiant analysts said they have \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d that the hackers are based in North America and that they collaborate with an additional person in Turkey. Brad Jones, chief information security officer at Snowflake, told CNN in a separate statement that the company has not found evidence this activity was \u201ccaused by a vulnerability, misconfiguration or breach of Snowflake\u2019s platform.\u201d Jones said this has been verified by investigations by third-party cybersecurity experts at Mandiant and CrowdStrike. AT&T said it launched an investigation, hired cybersecurity experts and took steps to close the \u201cillegal access point.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context and developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/business/att-customers-massive-breach/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_success_buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage", "text": "Moving somewhere new when you retire isn\u2019t uncommon. But deciding whether to take out a new mortgage to buy a home is a big deal. Much of your financial life is changing as you transition from a steady paycheck to a mix of fixed and variable income and a new lifestyle. So adding a large debt to the picture isn\u2019t an easy call. That\u2019s especially true now that mortgage rates hover around 7% and home prices keep rising. \u201cAny time you take on debt, you increase risk in your situation,\u201d said Illinois-based certified financial planner Jim Stork. More than a third (35%) of homebuyers last year were between the ages of 59 and 98, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Within that group, a majority financed their purchases. Whether taking out a new mortgage makes sense for you depends on a lot of factors, including how to prove to a lender that you\u2019re a good credit risk, plus your feelings about the debt and the ongoing cost of maintaining a home. To get a mortgage, your age won\u2019t be a factor, but your income will be If you\u2019re concerned that you may be less attractive to a mortgage banker because you\u2019ve hit retirement age, know that it is illegal to discriminate against anyone applying for a mortgage based on their age. Lenders\u2019 chief focus will be on your ability to repay your mortgage with your various sources of non-paycheck income. \u201cWhen you qualify for a mortgage, it\u2019s all based on your income,\u201d said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage. That, and of course any debt you have that will soak up your income, but we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. The income sources that lenders consider, absent a regular paycheck, include: Social Security benefits, pension or annuity income, spousal benefits, disability payments, interest and dividends and your 401(k) or IRA. If a portion of your income is not subject to tax, the lender may treat it as worth 25% more. Fannie Mae offers this example: Say 15% of a $1,500 monthly Social Security benefit is tax free. That means $225 of it will not be subject to tax ($1,500 x 15%). And 25% of that amount comes to $56 ($225 x 25%). So that $56 can be added to a person\u2019s qualifying Social Security income amount ($1,500 + $56 = $1,556). If you want to use your nest egg, different methods can be used to calculate how much income it would provide. There is the asset depletion method in which your eligible assets are divided by your loan term. In the case of a 30-year mortgage, that would be 360 months. If your IRA is worth $700,000, that translates into $1,944 per month ($700,000/360). \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to take the money out \u2014 but you can use your assets [to qualify for a mortgage] as if you were going to take the distribution,\u201d Cohn said. Another option: If you are at least 59-1/2, you can start taking monthly distributions from an IRA without penalty \u2014 or a 401(k) if your plan rules permit \u2014 and the lender will count that as income so long as you show that you have sufficient funds in the account to keep taking that same monthly distribution for three years. Once you close on your home, Cohn said, you can reduce or stop taking distributions if you choose. That assumes you are not yet in your 70s when the IRS requires you to start taking minimum distributions, said Mark Luscombe, a principal analyst at Wolters, Kluwer Tax & Accounting. Burdened by debt? Lenders will also assess your debt-to-income ratio, because no matter how much income you have, the big question is how much of it will be consumed by your debts. The debt portion is composed of your expected mortgage payment plus any credit card, student loan, car loan or other outstanding debt you may have. Generally speaking, for conventional loans your DTI ratio can be up to 50%, Cohen said. That ratio falls to between 43% and 45% if you\u2019re taking out a jumbo loan, she added. A jumbo loan exceeds the conforming loan limits in the area you want to buy. But ideally your debt level will fall well below these top limits, both for the lender\u2019s sake and yours. And, of course, the higher your credit score, the better the interest rate you can get on a mortgage. What you should consider before taking out a mortgage Even before seeking a mortgage, get a good grasp on your expected monthly income and expenses in retirement. Compared to pre-retirement earnings, \u201cMost (new retirees) see a decrease in income,\u201d said certified financial planner Lori Trawinski, director of finance and employment at AARP. While some expenses may also decline \u2014 e.g., work-related costs like commuting \u2014 others may increase over time, Trawinski said, like medical costs, property taxes, home insurance and utilities. Of course, you can downsize and move to a lower-cost area. But if you stay near where you lived during your career, your expenses are likely to rise over time. Also, Trawinski noted, if you\u2019re married, consider what will happen to your household income when one spouse dies. This will help you assess your future comfort level in carrying a mortgage. \u201cPeople often fail to plan for the death of a spouse. You can take a big hit to your income when that happens,\u201d she said. If you do move to a new state or region, weigh renting first. You can get a better sense of the cost of living in the area and decide whether it\u2019s a good fit for you. As Stork put it, \u201cFlorida in August is not as fun as Florida in January.\u201d How much are you really willing to take on? All the usual financial decisions that go into homebuying apply no matter your age. But, in retirement especially, you don\u2019t want to take on more debt than necessary, since the cost of a mortgage is fixed, but the returns on your investments, the housing market and your health needs are variable. At the very least, Stork said, consider whether you can put enough money down \u2014 at least 20% \u2014 to avoid having to pay private mortgage insurance. Beyond that, consider whether you feel comfortable keeping up \u2014 and paying for \u2014 maintenance on a home. Maintenance might amount to 2% a year of your home\u2019s value, Stork said. That amounts to $10,000 a year on a $500,000 home. Maintenance is essential in preserving the value of your house should you ever decide to sell. How would your mortgage interest rate compare to a reasonable rate of return on your investments? The decision to get a mortgage was a lot easier for retirees when rates were historically low \u2014 roughly 3% \u2014 and their nest eggs were earning a lot more. \u201cBut at today\u2019s rates it\u2019s a much harder calculation,\u201d Stork said. This is especially the case if you\u2019re a very conservative investor. \u201cIf your CDs are earning 4% and a mortgage would cost you 7%, you will lose money every day on that decision,\u201d Stork explained.

{"id": "2024_07_01_media_redbox-bankruptcy", "text": "The parent company of Redbox, those distinctive, red-colored kiosks at grocery stores that sell or rent DVDs, has filed for bankruptcy after enduring months of financial struggle. Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment (CSSE) revealed in a filing that it has nearly $1 billion in debt and owes millions of dollars to several entertainment companies including the BBC and Sony Pictures, plus to retailers ranging from Walmart to Walgreens. Filings show that the company took on about $325 million in debt following its purchase of Redbox in 2022 from private equity giant Apollo Global Management. The plan was to make it into an entertainment conglomerate, combining the DVD rental business with its free streaming services, like Crackle, the entertainment platform once owned by Sony. Those plans didn\u2019t pan out, hindered by dual Hollywood strikes that limited production of fresh content and the decline of people renting physical DVDs that even forced rival Netflix to quit that part of its business last year. CSSE declined to comment. Deadline previously reported that Redbox hadn\u2019t paid employees for a week, and medical benefits have been suspended. Filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy could help the company fix those issues if its plans are approved by a court in Delaware. The company\u2019s publishing arm, which produces those ubiquitous self-help books that were once a worldwide phenomenon, isn\u2019t affected by the bankruptcy filing of its entertainment unit. The number of Redbox kiosks has grown to about 34,000 across the US, largely located at grocery and drug stores. Since its 2002 launch, Redbox has rented its 1 billion discs at prices cheaper than cable, according to its website.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/media/redbox-bankruptcy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can \u201clisten\u201d to people\u2019s questions and converse in real time. \u201cShellie\u201d can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while \u201cArif\u201d is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

The shutdown of Kaspersky Lab\u2019s US operations will start on July 20, ending nearly two decades of the company operating in the country, according to the company\u2019s statement. \u201cThe company has carefully examined and evaluated the impact of the US legal requirements and made this sad and difficult decision as business opportunities in the country are no longer viable,\u201d Kaspersky Lab said. Independent journalist Kim Zetter first\u00a0reported\u00a0the news of the company\u2019s shutdown. The Commerce Department last month\u00a0announced\u00a0the ban of the sale and provision of Kaspersky software in the United States, citing national security concerns. US officials have claimed that the Russian government could use Kaspersky\u2019s popular anti-virus software to surveil Americans through hacking or data collection. Kaspersky has strenuously denied those claims. More than 400 million people and 240,000 companies worldwide use Kaspersky Lab\u2019s software products, according to the company. Just how many of those people and companies are in the United States is not clear. US government agencies were already banned from using Kaspersky\u00a0Lab software but the Commerce Department\u2019s move to prevent the sale of the software in the United States was unprecedented. The legal authorities cited by the Commerce Department are relatively new and derived in part from a 2021 executive order that President Joe Biden signed in the name of protecting Americans\u2019 personal data from \u201cforeign adversaries\u201d and a related order signed by then-President Donald Trump in 2019. CNN\u00a0reported\u00a0in April that the Commerce Department was taking action against Kaspersky Lab. Founded in Moscow in 1997, Kaspersky Lab grew into one of the world\u2019s most successful anti-virus software companies alongside American rivals like McAfee and Symantec. Kaspersky Lab\u2019s researchers, recognized as top-tier in the cybersecurity industry, are known for analyzing hacking operations suspected of being carried out by a variety of governments including Russia, the United States and Israel, but also cybercriminal threats that affect everyday users.

{"id": "2024_07_01_tech_meta-eu-competition-rules", "text": "Facebook parent Meta has been accused of breaking Europe\u2019s new digital competition rules over its \u201cpay or consent\u201d advertising model. Late last year, Meta (META)\u00a0launched\u00a0a service called \u201cSubscription for no ads,\u201d allowing European users of Facebook and Instagram to pay up to \u20ac12.99 ($14) a month for ad-free versions. The alternative is to accept versions with personalized ads. The European Commission said in a statement Monday that, in its preliminary view, \u201cthis binary choice forces users to consent to the (use) of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalized but equivalent version of Meta\u2019s social networks.\u201d If the provisional findings of the Commission\u2019s investigation are confirmed, the EU could hit Meta with a fine equivalent to 10% of its global annual revenue under its landmark Digital Markets Act. Based on the company\u2019s 2023 results, that would amount to $13.5 billion. Meta said it didn\u2019t accept the Commission\u2019s findings. \u201c\u2019Subscription for no ads\u2019 follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.\u201d The EU announcement comes a week after the Commission accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the DMA by preventing app developers from freely directing consumers to cheaper services. The regulators are also investigating Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) under the new law. The DMA, which came into force in March, requires dominant online platforms \u2014 so-called gatekeepers \u2014 to give users more choice, and rivals more opportunities to compete. Online platforms often collect personal data across their own and third-party services and use it in digital advertising services. Margrethe Vestager, a European Commissioner in charge of competition policy, noted in Monday\u2019s statement that Meta had been accumulating personal data of \u201cmillions of EU citizens over many years.\u201d \u201cWe want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalized ads experience,\u201d she said. Michael Koenig, a senior official at the Commission, said Meta must offer users an alternative to \u201cfull\u201d ad personalization that \u201cdoes not rely on this personal data and which is then automatically less personalized and still available to them.\u201d \u201cThen Meta is free to keep a third option, which is a subscription not to see ads at all, or a fourth option which may have some premium features,\u201d he told journalists. The Commission is due to conclude its probe into Meta by late March next year.

{"id": "2024_04_24_tech_nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc", "text": "Texting on the Moon? Streaming on Mars? It may not be as far away as you think. That\u2019s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets. A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year \u2014 the exact date has yet to be confirmed \u2014 carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon\u2019s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth. \u201cThe first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,\u201d Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation. The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia\u2019s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice. One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice. Images of ice \u2014 transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network \u2014 would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon. For NASA\u2019s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable. Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund \u2014 especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated. \u201cBeing able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis \u2014 as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,\u201d said Engelund. \u201cEventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.\u201d It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth\u2019s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing \ufeffspace colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth. NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy. Bell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the \u201cframework for the lunar economy.\u201d \u201cA future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,\u201d Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN. \u201cThis includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.\u201d There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too. If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth \u2014 such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms. \u201cEspecially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,\u201d Klein said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/tech/nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_business_kei-trucks-japan-tiny-movement", "text": "Measuring about half the length of a Ford F-150, Kei trucks look almost like toys in comparison to your standard pickup truck. But for a car so tiny, you might be surprised at the massive following that they command. Kei trucks, built to satisfy Japanese light automobile regulations and known as \u201ckeitora\u201d (meaning \u201clight truck\u201d) in Japan, are vehicles that have been enjoying a surge in popularity in the automobile market. Sales of Kei trucks tripled in the last five years, with around 7,500 total imported just last year, according to data from Japan Used Motor Vehicle. Meanwhile, auto experts see the Kei truck craze as a pushback against big trucks by cash-strapped Americans as the average pickup size and average price tag skyrocketed post-pandemic, according to data from Cars.com. But the cult following of these mini trucks might be better measured by the ubiquity of online spaces that owners and enthusiasts have carved out for themselves. Instagram page Kei Trucks Appreciation Society (@keitrucksas) sells Kei truck-themed merchandise from hoodies to stickers and posts memes for its more than 95,000 followers. On X, Kei truck fans share pictures of mini trucks they spot in the wild. There is even a dedicated Reddit forum where over 23,000 members trade tips on truck maintenance and their experiences importing from Japan. But also common are discussions on the ever-changing legality of Kei trucks by state. While federal regulation allows the import of mini trucks so long as they are 25 years or older, state laws surrounding on-road use and registration are spotty. Most states lack Kei-specific regulation entirely, and so far, only 19 states allow Kei trucks on public roads. In New York, where laws are stricter, they can\u2019t be registered or titled. But despite limitations, demand for Kei trucks continues to grow. Here\u2019s what makes them so popular. Tiny but mighty On the practical end, Kei trucks combine utility and affordability. \u201cPeople want the functionality of a truck, but they don\u2019t want the size of it or to spend $60,000 on it,\u201d said George Zotos, owner and CEO of Kei truck brokerage company OIWA.co. Prices for the Ford F-150 Raptor, one of the line\u2019s higher-power models, start at $78,440. And the high-end 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 High Country starts at $68,495. According to Zotos, the sticker price for Kei trucks sold can range anywhere from $500 to $6,000. Research by CNN shows that they can go for even more than that in good condition. Tetsu Ichino, owner of Japanese grocery store Maruichi in Rockville, Maryland, told CNN that he bought his Kei truck for $5,000. Adding shipping and taxes, his total came to $8,100. \u201cI was able to buy it with my credit card. I\u2019ve never bought a car with a credit card, so that was a first for me,\u201d he said. Ichino, a lifelong truck enthusiast, sold his full-size pickup Toyota Tundra in March because he didn\u2019t use it often enough but later missed the utility it provided. He told CNN that while he originally planned to buy another similarly sized truck, he found himself caught up in the Kei truck hype. The engine on Ichino\u2019s 1998 Honda Acty is smaller than that of a motorcycle, but he says it\u2019s still one of the most practical trucks out there. And in Maryland, where there are no Kei-specific rules, he mainly uses it for transporting supplies to his store. \u201cFor the majority of what I do, I will be able to do with the Kei truck,\u201d he said. According to Andrew O\u2019Bright, managing member of Japanese auto import company JDM Imports CT, most mini trucks have the same roughly 6-foot bed size as the F-150, Ford\u2019s full-size pickup truck line known for its towing capacity and powerful engine.   \u201cThey have the utility of an F-150 while getting 30 to 50 miles to the gallon on top of cheaper insurance, cheaper gas,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything about them tells consumers this is the way to go.\u201d Novelty factor But efficiency isn\u2019t the Kei truck\u2019s only point of appeal. Their unique, toy-like image also lends them a sense of novelty. \u201cIt is hard to quantify other than people just have a fascination with this micro vehicle,\u201d Zotos said. He also points to the truck\u2019s versatility as another reason why they appeal to such a wide demographic. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about people who are just turning 16 and getting their driver\u2019s license,\u201d he said. \u201cI had another customer in Chicago who got a truck just to wrap it for advertising.\u201d The cuteness factor of the Kei truck has proved advantageous for Melissa Torre, founder of Philadelphia-based soap and skincare company Vellum Street. As a small business owner, Torre is a regular at farmers markets where vendors are usually allotted a 10x10 space. To avoid the hassle of carting her merchandise back and forth between the parking area and the market lot, she began looking into trucks she could operate her business out of. But the milk vans and box trucks she originally considered were much longer, and she would need to buy two spaces to set up shop. In her research process, Torre came across Kei trucks, which run less than 11 feet in length. \u201cThey would fit exactly in the allotted space that I had been using. It was just a perfect transition without having to increase my cost,\u201d she said. \u201cI get to just pull up and set right up in the back of my truck. So it\u2019s made life a lot easier.\u201d She told CNN that she even spray-painted bubbles on her 1996 Daihatsu Hijet to match her company\u2019s branding. \u201cPeople who may not have stopped before to talk to me at markets will stop and talk about the truck. It\u2019s a driving billboard, but in a fun way,\u201d she said. \u201cKids love it. Adults love it. People are always surprised that I actually drove it there.\u201d Smaller and simpler But for all their popularity, auto experts don\u2019t see Kei trucks becoming mainstream. \u201cIt\u2019d be hard to imagine,\u201d said Mark Schirmer, director of corporate communications at Cox Automotive. He pointed to the failure of Mercedes\u2019 Smart brand in the US but their success in Japan as an example of smaller vehicles performing better in countries with smaller roads. Smart cars, small vehicles built with only two seats and minimal trunk space by Mercedes-Benz, were introduced in 2008 but exited the U.S. market in 2019 due to weak sales. \u201cI think Americans are just used to space,\u201d Schirmer added. And non-profit organizations like the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety have been vocal about their opposition to on-road use of mini trucks, citing concerns about the safety of low-speed vehicles. Still, he sees the popularity of more compact \u2013 if not quite small \u2013 truck models like the Ford Maverick and Hyundai Santa Cruz as a sign of Americans\u2019 appetite for a smaller truck segment. Whereas the Ford F-150 offers 5.5-foot, 6.5-foot and 8-foot bed options, the Maverick is only available in a 4.5-foot bed. But sales numbers hit 40,420 through the first half of 2024, according to data from Ford. And data from Edmunds showed that Americans were trading in more midsize and large pickup trucks for compact trucks than vice versa. Ivan Drury, Edmunds\u2019 director of Insights, says climbing costs for trucks, coupled with high interest rates, are at the heart of this shifting preference toward smaller trucks. \u201cI think people have always liked the utility of trucks, but unfortunately, when they found out that they liked trucks 10 years ago, the price just started going through the roof,\u201d he said. \u201cWith all the features and add-ons, you look at how much a truck has changed over the last 10 years, they\u2019re nothing like what they used to be.\u201d As competition within the auto industry heats up and automakers race to put out more advanced features, Drury says the popularity of smaller vehicles signals a desire for a return to simpler car models. \u201cThere\u2019s tons of technology,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point, it\u2019s going to be too much and you turn away from it. You\u2019re like, \u201c\u2019I don\u2019t need all that.\u2019\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/business/kei-trucks-japan-tiny-movement/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

Shoppers are also being squeezed by\u00a0higher prices at the grocery store, with food prices experiencing modest upticks last month, according to the newest inflation report. \u201cStop & Shop has evaluated its overall store portfolio and made the difficult decision to close underperforming stores to create a healthy base for the future growth of our brand,\u201d said the chain\u2019s president Gordon Reid in a release. Ahold Delhaize, the chain\u2019s Dutch parent company, revealed the locations Friday adding that they will close in early November. The closures come amid a broader shake up in the US grocery industry including the rise of low-cost grocery brand Aldi, which plans to open open 800 locations. In addition, Kroger and Albertson\u2019s announced plans for a $25 billion merger earlier this year. The Federal Trade Commission has sued to block it. Ahold Delhaize announced in May at its investor day that store reductions were planned, but didn\u2019t specify locations. The affected stores span all five states it has locations in, including 10 in New Jersey, eight in Massachusetts, seven in New York, five in Connecticut plus two locations in Rhode Island. Stop & Shop said it \u201cremains committed to serving its communities through other store locations, online shopping and home delivery services.\u201d Employees impacted by the closures will be offered other opportunities in the company.

{"id": "2024_06_12_success_saving-under-high-interest-rates", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is an updated version of an article that originally ran on May 1. As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged for its seventh meeting in a row on Wednesday. People carrying variable-rate debt like credit cards and those seeking a loan won\u2019t be happy given that the Fed\u2019s rate, which directly and indirectly affects consumers\u2019 borrowing costs, remains at a 23-year high. Those rates will likely stay high for a while. At this point, only one cut is seen as likely before the end of the year, according to US central bankers\u2019 latest summary of economic projections. But whenever the cuts start, they may be small. \u201cAbsent a complete about-face from the economy, interest rates aren\u2019t likely to come down soon enough, or fast enough, to provide meaningful relief to borrowers. Utilize zero-percent credit card balance transfer offers, shop around for lower fixed-rate personal loans and home equity loans, and channel as much income as possible toward paying down this debt as quickly as possible,\u201d said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com\u2019s chief financial analyst. But the Fed\u2019s decision leaves savers, once again, in the catbird seat when it comes to making money on their money. \u201cSavers are enjoying the best returns on savings accounts and CDs in more than 15 years, with the most competitive offers outpacing inflation. In addition, these conditions are poised to persist for the foreseeable future,\u201d McBride said. Online high-yield savings accounts The best bang for your savings can still be had in online high-yield savings accounts at FDIC-insured banks, which yield way more than today\u2019s 0.58% overall average savings rate. As of June 11, the average online savings account rate was 4.40%, according to DepositAccounts.com. And many online high-yield accounts continue to offer rates of 5% or more. Say you have $10,000 in savings. If you leave it parked in a regular savings account at 0.5%, you\u2019ll get $50 in interest for a year. If you put it instead in a 5% high-yield account, you\u2019ll get $500. A high-yield savings account is the best place to park money you\u2019ll need to cover emergencies as well as anticipated large expenses that you have to pay in the next three months to a year. As with any savings account, banks can lower the rate they offer \u2014 also known as the APY \u2014 at any time. And you can be sure they will do just that when the Fed looks like it will finally start cutting rates, McBride said. But, he added, since rates are likely to be cut in small increments, online high-yield savings accounts may continue to offer inflation-beating returns for some time. \u201cThey will still offer the best way to preserve your [money\u2019s] buying power,\u201d McBride said. Money market accounts and money market funds Money market deposit accounts and money market mutual funds are generating yields competitive with the best high-yield savings accounts. But there are important differences. Money market deposit accounts are bank products. So, assuming your bank is FDIC insured, your account is too. (Or, if your account is at a federally backed credit union, your money will be\u00a0insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.) As with high-yield accounts, you may get the best deals at an online bank. But money market accounts may have a higher minimum deposit requirement than a high-yield account. Money market funds, by contrast, are an investment product \u2014 they generate return by investing in short-term, low-risk debt instruments and are currently yielding an average of 5.12%, according to the Crane 100 Money Fund Index. Such funds are a good place to park cash you have in your brokerage account that you may want to use at some point to buy equities or bonds, McBride said. Money market funds are not FDIC-insured, but any brokerage you use should be insured by the\u00a0Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which\u00a0covers your funds up to a limit if your brokerage ever goes under. Certificates of deposit CDs are still a great place to park any money you can leave untouched for a fixed\u00a0period of time \u2014 anywhere from a few months to five years or longer. As of June 11, the average rate was 4.971% on an online one-year CD, and 3.815% on a five-year CD, according to DepositAccounts.com. While your brick-and-mortar bank may offer a CD at a good rate, you may get a better one shopping around. The easiest way to do that without having to set up an additional account at another bank is to shop for CDs through your online brokerage, which is likely to offer a wide array of CDs from many different banks. At Schwab.com, for instance, CDs on offer ranging in duration from three months all the way up to 10 years offered average annual returns over 5%, with most ranging between 5.30% and 5.45%. The highest annual average was 5.56% for a three-month CD. If you have to withdraw money before the end of a CD\u2019s term, you can always get all of your principal back but may forfeit some of the interest earned as an early withdrawal penalty. Treasury bills and notes Beyond deposit accounts, investing in short-term Treasury bills and intermediate-term Treasury notes has been another way to earn a competitive return with virtually no risk since Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Treasury bills come in six different maturities: 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 13 weeks, 17 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks. Treasury notes mature in two, three, five, seven or 10 years. \u201cAs long as the Fed holds its rate in the 5.25% to 5.5% range, we expect most Treasury bill yields to hover around 5.25% as well,\u201d said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. But, Martin added, \u201cWhile the timing of rate cuts has been pushed back, we still expect them to arrive later this year, and investors in short-term investments would likely face reinvestment risk.\u201d That\u2019s why he suggests investors consider buying some intermediate-term investments now before rates are cut if they want to lock in a higher yield for some of their money, such as Treasury notes maturing in the next four to 10 years. On Wednesday, yields on Treasury bills were north of 5% and yields on Treasury notes were north of 4%, according to Schwab.com. When deciding whether it makes sense to invest in a CD or a Treasury for the same duration, you might opt for the Treasury if you live in a high-tax state, McBride suggested, since interest on Treasuries is\u00a0exempt from state and local taxes. In all instances, the easiest way to purchase Treasuries and other bonds is to do so through your brokerage account.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/success/saving-under-high-interest-rates/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_media_george-stephanopoulos-biden-tmz-video", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. George Stephanopoulos, sporting a T-shirt, shorts, and over-the-ear headphones, was traversing the New York City streets by foot on Tuesday when he was approached by a stranger who asked for his thoughts on\u00a0President Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0fitness for office. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can serve four more years,\u201d candidly replied the\u00a0ABC News\u00a0anchor, who had just sat down with Biden a few days earlier for his first on-camera television interview following the\u00a0CNN\u00a0presidential debate. The blunt remark from Stephanopoulos \u2014 video of which\u00a0made its way\u00a0to\u00a0TMZ\u00a0\u2014 served as the latest example of the news media turning on Biden, expressing strong concerns about whether he has the fortitude to defeat\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0in November and then serve an additional term in office. On Tuesday night, Stephanopoulos expressed regret for his frank remark, saying through a spokesperson, \u201cEarlier today I responded to a question from a passerby. I shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d (Notably, Stephanopoulos did not withdraw the viewpoint he articulated, but simply said he shouldn\u2019t have expressed it.) ABC News separately said that Stephanopoulos \u201cexpressed his own point of view and not the position of ABC News.\u201d Regardless, any damage inflicted by the comment was already done. It goes without saying that Stephanopoulos is far from alone amongst his peers in the news media in sharing that opinion. Whether fair or unfair (and I do believe you can argue some of the coverage over the past two weeks has been over the top and irresponsible), the reality is that Biden has, at this juncture, lost much of the press corps. Many journalists simply do not buy the narrative that Biden, his campaign, and the White House are selling. \u201cTo Serve His Country, President Biden Should Leave the Race,\u201d The New York Times\u00a0editorial board titled a\u00a0scathing piece\u00a0last week as several other prominent figures called for him to step aside. That loss of trust poses a significant challenge for Biden as he tries to convince the American public that he is up for the difficult task before him. Every move Biden makes, every sentence he utters, has now fallen under a microscope, never a good sign for a political candidate. Worse for Biden, he is no longer being given the benefit of the doubt. In fact, just the opposite. The president said this week that he does not care about what \u201cthe elites\u201d think about his candidacy. But, given his decades in politics, he surely knows that alienating and going to war with the news media is not a winning strategy. Whether he likes it or not, how the news media covers his campaign influences how millions of Americans view his fitness for office. And given how close the 2024 race already was\u00a0before\u00a0the CNN debate, the recent coverage battering Biden\u2019s campaign poses a grave threat to its livelihood. How Biden might manage to pull himself out of this media storm threatening to consume his candidacy remains to be seen. Can he? Thus far, the steps Biden has taken to win back trust have failed to deliver the desired outcome. The Stephanopoulos interview is the perfect example of that. Instead of helping him move forward, granting the interview has effectively backfired, with Biden failing to even convince Stephanopoulos with his message. The fact that the president could not convince the interviewer his campaign hand-picked for his first post-debate sit-down of his ability to lead the nation for the next four years does not bode well for his campaign.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/media/george-stephanopoulos-biden-tmz-video/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices", "text": "Actress Judy Garland never recorded her voice to read an audiobook of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but you\u2019ll soon be able to hear her rendition of the children\u2019s novel that inspired the movie nonetheless. Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_business_demolition-ranch-shirt-trump-shooter", "text": "Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20-year-old who\u00a0opened fire on former President Donald Trump\u00a0during a campaign rally Saturday\u00a0in Pennsylvania, was pictured twice wearing a t-shirt that said \u201cDemolition Ranch\u201d on it. A law enforcement official told CNN that one of the times was when Crooks was at an ammo store and the other was during the assassination attempt. Demolition Ranch is a popular YouTube channel for gun enthusiasts with more than 11 million subscribers. Its founder, Texas-based Matt Carriker, distanced the brand from the shooter in an almost six-minute-long video posted Monday on the channel. \u201cWe were shocked and confused to find this out: The shooter who tried to assassinate Trump was wearing merch from my channel, wearing a Demolition Ranch t-shirt. And that sucked to see that. Yeah, that was rough,\u201d he said. The video racked up more than 520,000 views within two hours of publishing. Demolition Ranch usually posts a variety of videos relating to guns with titles such as \u201cEating A Meal Cooked ONLY With A GUN!!!\u201d and \u201cHow Lethal is The TINIEST Gun I Own???\u201d \u201cNo matter what side you\u2019re on politically, none of us want violence. This channel was never meant to incite violence or hate,\u201d Carriker said in the video. The shirts are printed in Carriker\u2019s hometown and sold and shipped all over the world, he said in the video. Carriker said Demolition Ranch cannot vet everyone who buys its products. T-shirts are sold online for about $30, and the online store also sells hoodies, hats, stickers and other accessories. \u201cTo see my name next to the shooter\u2019s name sucks. And I wish, I wish we could keep that from happening,\u201d Carriker said. Crooks\u2019 attack killed one and critically injured two others. Crooks had been perched on a nearby building rooftop outside the rally\u2019s security perimeter, and was shot and killed by Secret Service agents, according to law enforcement officials. On Friday before the attack, he went to a shooting range where he was a member, and practiced firing, a law enforcement official told CNN. The next morning, Crooks went to a hardware store, where he bought a five-foot ladder, and also went to a gun store, where he purchased 50 rounds of ammunition, the official said.

{"id": "2024_07_15_investing_trump-media-stock-shooting-truth-social", "text": "The value of former President Donald Trump\u2019s social media company spiked Monday after he was injured in an attempted assassination over the weekend. Trump Media & Technology Group\u2019s share price surged more than 30% Monday morning, putting it on track for what would be the biggest single-day gain since the company debuted in late March. During premarket trading, Trump Media shares skyrocketed by 70% at one point before the gains eased during regular trading. The spike is sharply lifting the value of Trump\u2019s dominant stake in the owner of Truth Social. At current prices, Trump\u2019s 114.75 million shares in Trump Media are worth nearly $5 billion. That\u2019s up from $3.5 billion on Friday, the day before Trump was shot at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trading under the ticker symbol \u201cDJT,\u201d Trump Media has achieved a massive valuation despite making little revenue and Truth Social remaining a tiny player in social media. Experts have said Trump Media is a meme stock: trading on momentum and hype, not fundamentals. For months, Trump Media has been a way for investors to bet on Trump returning to the White House, making Truth Social the primary platform for presidential communications. Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management, told CNN on Monday that traders are already speculating that Trump\u2019s chances of winning in November have gone up significantly in the past few days. \u201cYou are seeing the Trump trade on steroids here. DJT is the go-to,\u201d Tuttle said. The rally comes as Trump prepares to formally accept the Republican nomination for president at the convention in Milwaukee this week. Trump Media recently announced it has been added to the Russell 1000 Index of large-cap stocks and the Russell 3000 Index. As a result, countless retail investors now own a piece of Trump Media through mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/investing/trump-media-stock-shooting-truth-social/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_business_airbnb-hidden-cameras-key-takeaways-invs", "text": "For years, Airbnb has known some of its hosts have used hidden cameras to secretly spy on guests, invading their most private and intimate moments. While Airbnb has repeatedly acknowledged the problem in financial filings, it has worked to keep the scope of the issue out of the public eye through arbitration, confidential settlements and employee non-disclosure agreements. The company has also fought against regulations that could protect users and would provide authorities with more insight into who is using the platform. CNN reviewed more than 2,000 pages of lawsuits and police records to understand more about the short-term rental industry\u2019s hidden camera problem. CNN also spoke with nearly two dozen guests who found surveillance devices at vacation rentals or were told by police they were secretly recorded. A CNN investigation found the use of hidden cameras is a persistent problem in the industry. Regulations are sparse, and the punishments for those that commit these crimes are lenient \u2013 video voyeurism is typically charged as a misdemeanor. Meanwhile, the people who are recorded \u2013 often naked or engaging in sexual activities \u2013 say they suffer from long-term trauma and the fear that their images could, at any moment, be disseminated on the internet. An Airbnb spokesperson told CNN that hidden camera complaints are rare, but when they do occur, \u201cwe take appropriate, swift action, which can include removing hosts and listings that violate the policy.\u201d Airbnb has generated tens of thousands of customer support tickets related to surveillance devices over the last decade At a court-ordered deposition last year, an Airbnb representative was supposed to answer a key question from the attorney suing the company: How many complaints or reports had been made to Airbnb since December 1, 2013, of people who had been recorded by surveillance devices? The Airbnb representative testified that the company generated 35,000 customer support tickets about surveillance devices in the preceding decade. An Airbnb spokesperson told CNN that a single report could create multiple tickets. The company declined to specify how many unique complaints there have been. In the deposition, which has not been previously reported, the company representative sought to downplay the significance of the number of tickets, testifying they could reflect instances such as a malfunctioning doorbell camera or a tablet with recording capabilities left out on a coffee table. The representative did not provide any statistics detailing the number of claims she suggested were innocuous among the 35,000 tickets. One former employee who handled safety issues and security concerns for Airbnb\u2019s support line told CNN: \u201cI\u2019ve never received a call about a doorbell.\u201d The company doesn\u2019t have a policy instructing employees to contact law enforcement about hidden cameras Airbnb, as a matter of practice, does not notify law enforcement when they learn a host is \u201cfound to be in violation of the security camera and recording device policy,\u201d not even when a child is involved, the company representative testified. The company may, however, reach out to hosts about complaints as part of internal inquiries \u2013 a move law enforcement experts say could hinder criminal investigations because it gives suspects time to destroy evidence. Airbnb makes \u201cevery effort\u201d to support police investigations of hidden cameras, the company told CNN in a written statement. Airbnb has fought regulation efforts that could protect users Earlier this year, lawmakers in the European Union agreed to groundbreaking regulations governing the short-term rental industry. The new rules will require host registration, data sharing by the company and quality control of listings. Airbnb hailed the regulations as a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for the industry and praised the EU-wide approach. Its public praise belies the fact that Airbnb has fought European cities for attempting to regulate the industry, said Kim van Sparrentak, a member of the European Parliament, who steered the legislation through the governing body. \u201cAirbnb is similar to other sharing economy companies \u2013 on a municipal level that means filing lawsuits as soon as any regulation is proposed,\u201d she said, referring to the company\u2019s strategy of challenging regulations in court. There are no similar federal regulations in the United States. Airbnb has fought local regulations \u2013 many of which aim to tamp down on illegal listings or require data sharing with authorities \u2013 that would provide the government with more oversight. Airbnb does not perform background checks on all users. And even when it does, it tells customers not to rely on those checks Airbnb does not run background checks on all users, according to its website. The company says it may run a background check on a US-based user if it has at least a first name, last name and date of birth for a person who creates a listing. But the company\u2019s website tells users they should not rely on its background checks to identify \u201call past criminal convictions or sex offender registrations \u2026 or other red flags.\u201d And even if Airbnb discovers a user has a criminal background, convictions of \u201cmurder, terrorism, rape or child molestation\u201d are not automatic disqualifiers under the company\u2019s policy. Meanwhile, user verification is meant to ensure the accuracy of a listing and match a user\u2019s name with a government-issued ID. Airbnb says every host, co-host and booking guest is identity-verified. But the company concedes that its identity verification badge does not \u201cguarantee that someone is who they claim to be,\u201d according to its website. In a statement, an Airbnb spokesperson told CNN, \u201cAirbnb\u2019s trust and safety policies lead the vacation rental industry and include background checks on US-based hosts and guests.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/business/airbnb-hidden-cameras-key-takeaways-invs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

Macy\u2019s board of directors voted unanimously to end discussions with Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management over the investors\u2019 offers to acquire the chain. Macy\u2019s said Monday it was unclear that the investors could finance a deal and it was not in shareholders\u2019 best interest. The investors planned to take Macy\u2019s private and consider spinning off its real estate assets or separating its online operations from brick-and-mortar stores. The investors have been trying to buy Macy\u2019s since December. But Macy\u2019s rejected a previous offer to buy the company at $21 a share in January. In March, the investors upped its offer to $24 a share, and Macy\u2019s agreed to enter into talks about the bid. Now, it\u2019s calling off talks. Macy\u2019s will instead stick with its own strategy, led by new CEO Tony Spring, which includes closing underperforming Macy\u2019s stores and investing in its luxury Bloomingdale\u2019s and Bluemercury chains. Investor groups such as private equity funds and hedge funds have been active in recent decades in buying struggling or under-performing retailers, with the stated goal of taking them private, improving their operations and selling them for a profit. But the results have often led to closures, not salvation, for companies such as Sears and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. Macy\u2019s decision to end talks with the investors will benefit the chain, said retail analyst Neil Saunders in a note to clients Monday. \u201cOther than seeking to monetize Macy\u2019s real estate assets for short term gain, neither party brought any long-term value to the table,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of the activist investor proposals would have significantly weakened Macy\u2019s and hampered its ability to survive as a retail operation.\u201d Macy\u2019s stock tumbled around 13% during morning trading Wednesday to $16 a share. Macy\u2019s and other\u00a0traditional department stores\u00a0have struggled, as competition both from online retailers like Amazon and big box retailers, such as Walmart and Target \u2013 which offer shoppers the chance to buy groceries as well as clothes and other household goods \u2013 has left Macy\u2019s with a smaller slice of the retail pie.

The progressive news network confirmed the decision to preempt its influential and top-rated morning show after a CNN inquiry Sunday evening. The network said the show will resume airing Tuesday. The decision by MSNBC to leave one of its most recognizable programs on the sidelines amid a seismic politics-driven news cycle, with the Republican National Convention getting underway in the wake of the Saturday shooting at Trump\u2019s campaign rally, is certain to raise eyebrows. A person familiar with the matter told CNN that the decision was made to avoid a scenario in which one of the show\u2019s stable of two dozen-plus guests might make an inappropriate comment on live television that could be used to assail the program and network as a whole. Given the breaking news nature of the story, the person said, it made more sense to continue airing rolling breaking news coverage in the fraught political moment. \u201cGiven the gravity and complexity of this unfolding story, NBC News, NBC News NOW and MSNBC have remained in rolling breaking news coverage since Saturday evening,\u201d a spokesperson for NBCUniversal News Group said in a statement to CNN. \u201cAs we continue to cover this story into the week, the networks will continue to cross simulcast, alternating between NBC News, NBC News NOW and \u2018MSNBC Reports,\u2019 so there is one news feed covering this developing situation.\u201d In the wake of the attempt on Trump\u2019s life, some of the former president\u2019s supporters have vehemently criticized the press and liberal media commentators for their hard-knuckled reporting, which has sounded the alarm on what four more years under the former president would look like. Cesar Conde, the chairman of NBCUniversal News Group, made the decision in conjunction with Rashida Jones, the president of MSNBC, and hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, the person familiar with the matter told CNN. Over the course of the campaign cycle, news organizations have reported at length on Trump\u2019s plans to warp the federal government for his own ends, including to seek vengeance against his political opponents. That reporting is now facing scrutiny, with some Trump supporters blaming it for producing a charged atmosphere that gave way to the assassination attempt, while mostly looking past the incendiary rhetoric of the former president himself. MSNBC has, in particular, been blasted by Trump\u2019s allies, putting the network in the spotlight. Some of Trump\u2019s allies have gone as far as to attack the network\u2019s parent company, Comcast. It\u2019s not the first time MSNBC has made such programming decisions in charged political moments. Last year after Hamas executed its deadly October 7 attack on Israel, MSNBC quietly pulled three of its Muslim broadcasters from air. That move, which came after some pro-Israeli forces criticized the tone of the MSNBC\u2019s coverage, left some staffers at the network feeling uncomfortable,\u00a0Semafor reported at the time.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/media/msnbc-morning-joe-pulled-trump-assassination/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

A recent Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City survey of 170 small businesses showed that \u201ccredit standards tightened for the tenth consecutive quarter and credit quality decreased.\u201d \u201cSmall companies are more at risk and more sensitive to higher borrowing costs,\u201d\u00a0Matt Rowe, head of portfolio management and cross asset strategies at\u00a0Nomura Capital Management, told CNN. \u201cThe increase in implied and actual defaults that the S&P report is referencing is largely coming from the smaller cap part of the world.\u201d Consumer demand has also been underwhelming so far this summer, according to the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s latest survey of businesses that sell any kind of service. The latest spending data and comments from retailers in recent months have also demonstrated that US consumers aren\u2019t splurging this summer, unlike last year, and are instead spending more cautiously. That\u2019s troubling because the summertime is a crucial season for many kinds of service-providing businesses. Last month, an arcade and a hotel management company filed for bankruptcy, according to the S&P Global report, also citing \u201csupply-chain issues\u201d as another possible reason behind the run-up in business bankruptcies. But this might not be an omen for future economic pain, it could just be an unwinding of pandemic-related distortions in the economy. \u201cThis is probably more a story of normalization than anything,\u201d Josh Jamner, investment strategy analyst at ClearBridge Investments, told CNN. \u201cThere were a number of programs out there to support small businesses during the depths of the pandemic, and there were relatively fewer filings than usual in 2021 and 2022.\u201d Rising corporate bankruptcies could just reflect a lot of churn occurring in Corporate America, Jamner said. New business applications took off in 2020 and have remained elevated ever since, he said. Last year, there were a record 5.5 million applications to start a new business, though that pace has slowed so far in 2024, according to government statistics. \u201cAs businesses are closing, we\u2019re still also seeing plenty of new ones being formed,\u201d he added. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at a 23-year high for about a year now in a bid to stamp out inflation. In good news for borrowers, inflation resumed a downward trend in the spring after stalling early this year, which is widening the path for the Fed to finally begin lowering borrowing costs sometime this year. Fed officials expect to cut interest rates at least once this year, which wouldn\u2019t provide huge immediate relief, but it would still be significant. \u201cStarting to cut rates is just as important for businesses and consumers as how much rates will ultimately be cut because it is setting in motion rate cuts, which is a good thing,\u201d\u00a0Reena Aggarwal, director of the\u00a0Georgetown University Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s an important psychological impact of that because businesses won\u2019t have to worry about rates going up.\u201d Small-cap stocks gained ground last week after the latest Consumer Price Index came in weaker than expected, bolstering rate-cut prospects. Banks are threatening to end free checking. Don\u2019t panic Most banks offer free checking if, for instance, customers have their paycheck direct deposited or they maintain an average minimum balance, reports my colleague Jeanne Sahadi. The majority of people with checking accounts (73%) take advantage of the option, according to a 2023\u00a0Bankrate.com\u00a0survey. But if regulatory costs go up for banks, free services like checking may go away, at least if they follow Chase\u2019s lead. Marianne Lake, the head of Chase Bank, told the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0last week that Chase might stop offering free checking and other free banking services. \u201cConsumer banking is predicated on banks providing services for free to consumers such as checking accounts, debit cards and electronic bill paying. The model then relied on banks being able to recoup those costs elsewhere in the consumer banking business, such as with debit interchange fees, overdraft fees, late fees and higher interest rates,\u201d Jaret Seiberg, financial services analyst at TD Securities, wrote in an analysis of Lake\u2019s comments.

Earlier this year, the EU launched investigations into China\u2019s state support for its\u00a0wind turbine\u00a0and\u00a0solar panel suppliers. It has also recently completed an eight-month-long probe into Beijing\u2019s support for makers of electric vehicles, resulting in additional tariffs on EVs imported from China. Now, China will investigate if the bloc\u2019s probes violate the two sides\u2019 economic treaty and if they have hurt the country\u2019s trade with the 27 EU member states. The investigation by China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) will span a number of sectors, including rail, photovoltaics, wind power, and security inspection equipment, according to a statement posted on its website.

Last month, it opened a probe into pork imported from the bloc and it is also investigating European brandy imports. According to Wednesday\u2019s announcement, MOFCOM is launching its latest investigation in response to a June request by an industry group in China.

{"id": "2024_04_23_cars_electric-vehicle-sales-forecast-iea", "text": "Global electric vehicle sales are set to rise by more than a fifth to reach 17 million this year, powered by drivers in China, according to the International Energy Agency. In a report Tuesday, the IEA projected that \u201csurging demand\u201d for EVs over the next decade was set \u201cto remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport.\u201d It expects half of all cars sold globally to be electric by 2035, up from more than one in five this year, provided charging infrastructure keeps pace. The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs. The agency\u2019s bullish long-term outlook for EVs \u2014 based on current government policies \u2014 comes just days after the world\u2019s biggest battery EV maker Tesla slashed its prices in major markets to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers. Recent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The data \u201cdoes not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars. It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday. The growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers. The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union rose almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. In a statement, Birol said: \u201cRather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.\u201d Despite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats. In the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the world\u2019s biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States. Earlier this month, Tesla posted its first annual drop in sales in nearly four years. The company\u2019s stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year. China\u2019s BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023. Automakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the \u201cpace of the transition to EVs\u2026 will hinge on affordability.\u201d In China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average. \u201cIntensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,\u201d the IEA said. \u201cGrowing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,\u201d it added. Last year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market. \u201cChina is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,\u201d Birol said. Concerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an investigation late last year into China\u2019s state support for EV makers. The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the region\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW. EV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country. By 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA. That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year. \u201cThis shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,\u201d Birol said. The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector. In addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States. Under current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA.

{"id": "2024_07_13_business_postage-rate-increase", "text": "On Sunday, the cost of a stamp is going up for the second time this year,\u00a0jumping 5 cents for first class postage to 73 cents. You probably didn\u2019t notice. And truthfully, you may not care. But you should. Most people don\u2019t use mail the way they used to \u2013 if they send out mail at all. But the price of postage is a big deal to millions of businesses and organizations that spend most of the $40.8 billion a year spent on mail, including letters, bulk mailings, junk mail and periodicals. And higher prices are making them cut back \u2013 and hurting the budget of the US Postal Service and, potentially, its ability to continue its crucial services. That includes everything from delivering online purchases to life-saving prescription drugs. And this year, tens of millions of voters will cast their ballots in the presidential election by mail. And, most of all, businesses still depend on the mail to help them reach customers and keep the economy going. Postage increases used to be pegged to inflation, usually going up at most once a year. But Sunday will mark the sixth increase in three years, during which first-class stamp increases rose 10 percentage points faster than overall inflation. Major mailers say hiking prices that quickly will drive them away from the post office, eventually drying up the agency\u2019s budget. \u201cWe think they\u2019ve overshot the mark on raising their rates,\u201d said Michael Plunkett, CEO of the Association for Postal Commerce, which represents companies in the mailing and shipping industry. \u201cThese rate increases aren\u2019t generating much additional revenue because it\u2019s driving volume out of the system that is likely never to return.\u201d The price of a first-class stamp reached 10 cents in 1974, just before the 200th anniversary of the service. As recently as 2002 it stood at 34 cents, or half of today\u2019s price ahead of Sunday\u2019s increase. So if raising the prices of stamps could ultimately endanger the postal service, why does the USPS keep hiking the costs to mail a letter? The short answer is because the agency needs money \u2013 badly. The long answer is more complicated. A history older than America The postal service and the United States have grown side by side since before the country\u2019s birth \u2013 quite literally. Founding Father Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first postmaster general in 1775,\u00a0the USPS notes on its website. The service expanded to keep pace with the new nation, and to help bind the young country together. It was a major reason roads were constructed between its early cities. US 1, the first federal highway, started out as Boston Post Road to carry mail between New York and Boston, and still goes by that name in many locations. \u201cWhen Alexis de Tocqueville toured the young country, in 1831, the United States boasted twice as many post offices as Britain and five times as many as France,\u201d\u00a0Smithsonian Magazine noted in October 2020. Today it has 640,000 employees located in over 30,000 facilities nationwide. Postage stamps, though, took quite awhile longer to make an appearance. \u201cAlexander M. Greig\u2019s City Despatch Post, a private New York City carrier, issued the first adhesive stamps in the United States on February 1, 1842,\u201d\u00a0according to the Postal Service. Congress then authorized\u00a0postage stamps in 1847, and prepayment of postage was required in 1855.\u00a0The iconic Pony Express\u00a0\u2013 a feature in many a Western film and novel \u2013 came about five years later, in 1860. And the postal service has made other appearances in pop culture and American history. The climax of beloved holiday movie \u201cMiracle on 34th Street\u201d has (spoiler alert) the Post Office rescuing Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. The characters of Cliff on the 1980s sitcom \u201cCheers\u201d and Newman in the 1990s sitcom \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d were letter carriers.\u00a0The band The Postal Service\u00a0was an indie-pop darling near the turn of the century. And the 1985 novel (by David Brin) and 1997 movie (starring Kevin Costner) \u201cThe Postman\u201d take the importance of delivering mail into a dystopian, sci-fi future. Mail down 75%, packages up But mail deliveries shriveled with the introduction of new ways to communicate and connect. Families and friends can communicate by email, text or apps. Bills can get paid electronically. Physical mail doesn\u2019t play the same role in American life that it used to. For many, the individual letter is as relevant today as VHS movies, floppy computer discs and cassette tapes. This century\u2019s nickname for the traditional letter - snail mail - is hardly a compliment. In its most recent year, the service delivered 11.4 billion individual letters. That may sound like a lot, but it\u2019s down 75% from 20 years ago. While stamp prices have doubled in that time, most experts point the finger at technology instead. \u201cFor most households, mail is not a significant expenditure,\u201d Plunkett said. \u201cIf the price of a stamp was a dollar I would send the same number of Christmas cards out later this year as I did last year.\u201d In contrast, online shopping has lifted package deliveries significantly. But the Postal Service doesn\u2019t have the lock on that business that it does in its mail service, said Kevin Kosar, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cBefore the digital age hit, the Postal Service had a very valuable monopoly. Those days are gone,\u201d he said. \u201cThe package business is going up, but that\u2019s not a monopoly business for them. It\u2019s very competitive.\u201d But Plunkett and other critics worry that the growth in the competitive package business will not produce the profits needed to make up for the declining mail volumes. The major mailers were never going to like the idea of paying more for postage. But they argue, with considerable evidence to back them up, that raising rates as rapidly as they have been climbing, is driving away business the service needs and worsening its economic condition. \u201cBy jacking the rates up, its efficiency and productivity go way down,\u201d said Art Sackler, executive director of the Coalition for a 21st Century Postal Service, another trade group representing business that use the service. \u201cLast year, by its own measure, its efficiency dropped by the most in 60 years.\u201d \u2018Financial death spiral\u2019 Critics are concerned about the rate increases: The worsening finances and efficiency could eventually force the Postal Service to run out of money, perhaps within a few years, and either start depending on direct taxpayer subsidies from Congress that it doesn\u2019t currently receive or cut back on staffing and service. The Postal Service under current Postmaster General Louis DeJoy laid out a 10-year plan in 2021 to modernize the service and stem ongoing losses. Before, he told the Senate in April, the USPS had been in \u201cfinancial death spiral\u201d for years, but that under the $40 billion modernization plan, \u201cwe are making the changes necessary to ensure that we are around to serve the country well into the future.\u201d But the plan, which includes restructuring its network of mail handling facilities, using more full-time staff, improving transportation and delivery methods and investing in technology, has not lived up to early promises. The service had projected it would break even by its last fiscal year and post a $1.7 billion annual profit in the current fiscal year. Instead, it lost $6 billion last year and is forecast to lose another $6 billion or more in the current fiscal year, according to congressional testimony in April from Michael Kubayanda, chairman of the rate-setting Postal Regulatory Commission. And some of the unions that represent postal workers are concerned the modernization plan will try to improve finances by reducing the reliability of the service. \u201cThe cost of a letter is still a heck of deal,\u201d said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union. \u201cI think there\u2019s good and I think there\u2019s bad in the plan. I think we do have to adapt to the world of growing package business and declining mail volumes. Our concern with the 10-year plan is anything that slows down service.\u201d Kubayanda testified in April that he doubts the modernization plan will be able to achieve its financial and service goals. \u201cIt looks increasingly difficult to have a universal postal system that reaches every American six days a week, at affordable prices, with reasonably fast and reliable service, and is self-sustaining financially,\u201d\u00a0he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/business/postage-rate-increase/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_business_fed-chair-powell-talks-up-progress-on-inflation-but-says-rate-cuts-not-imminent-yet", "text": "Inflation has come a long way since reaching a four-decade peak two years ago, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday. However, central bank officials still want to see more progress before cutting interest rates, he noted, though they are also keeping a close eye on the job market. \u201cWe do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,\u201d Powell said in prepared testimony submitted to congressional lawmakers. During the hearing, Powell didn\u2019t specify that cutting this year remains likely, or give any hint about the timing of the first rate cut, which is a departure from previous comments he\u2019s made. \u201cThe most recent inflation readings, however, have shown some modest further progress, and more good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,\u201d he added. Powell appeared Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee to deliver his semiannual monetary policy report to Congress. He heads to the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday to address the same report on the state of the US economy. The Fed\u2019s key interest rate, which influences borrowing costs across the economy, has been at a 23-year high for about a year now, after the central bank aggressively lifted rates to bring down inflation. While the pace of price hikes slowed dramatically in 2023, it hit a snag early this year, which pushed back the timing of the first anticipated rate cut. Fed officials expect to cut interest rates just once this year, according to their latest economic projections in June, compared to the three cuts they forecast in March. Inflation resumed a downward trend in the spring, but officials appear to be in lockstep saying they need more evidence that inflation is truly headed toward their 2% goal. In June, consumer prices didn\u2019t rise on a monthly basis for the first time since November, according to the Fed\u2019s favorite inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index. The annual PCE inflation rate registered at 2.6% in June, down slightly from 2.7% in May. \u201cInflation is now around 2-and-a-half percent, so we have seen significant progress in bringing it down,\u201d New York Fed President John Williams said last week at an event in India. \u201cBut we still have a way to go to reach our 2% target on a sustained basis.\u201d But inflation isn\u2019t the only thing the Fed is watching as it mulls when to begin cutting interest rates. The Fed is watching America\u2019s long-robust job market closely after it has shown signs of cooling. That comes as US consumers show signs of pulling back after years of elevated inflation and a sharp rise in interest rates, according to the latest spending data and remarks from retailers. Here are key takeaways from Powell\u2019s hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. Powell says the labor market is back to normal \u2014 but there are still risks The Fed\u2019s top leader told senators that America\u2019s job market now looks similar to the way it did before the Covid-19 pandemic: \u201cstrong, but not overheated.\u201d The US job market rebounded mightily after a brief, pandemic-induced recession in 2020, and it has continued to expand ever since. But it has loosened a little recently: The unemployment rate last month crept up to its highest level in more than two years, and new applications for unemployment benefits have trended up in recent weeks. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that if the Fed waits too long to lower rates, the Fed could undo the progress we\u2019ve made in creating good-paying jobs,\u201d\u00a0Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, said during the hearing. The US job market is still a pillar of strength for the broader economy but it\u2019s not running at the same red-hot pace of a few years ago. The unemployment rate edged higher, to 4.1%, in June, the highest rate since November 2021, though employers have continued to hire at a brisk pace. The gap between job openings and the number of unemployed people seeking work, a measure of how tight the labor market is, has narrowed markedly over the past year. Powell expressed throughout the hearing that the Fed is fully aware that it is dealing with \u201ctwo-sided risks\u201d \u2014 one is of inflation heating back up because the central bank cut rates too soon, and the other is of the labor market weakening sharply because the Fed waited too long to cut rates. Both risks would result in consequences for Americans and the overall US economy. The Fed is tasked by Congress to both stabilize prices and maximize employment, and it balances its focus on either goal depending on the economic circumstances at the time. For a few years, the Fed has focused more on its inflation side of its dual mandate, but that has shifted recently. \u201cIf we see that the labor market were weakening unexpectedly, which is to say more than what we\u2019ve seen in a material way unexpectedly,\u201d Powell said, \u201cthen we could also respond to that, because we have a dual mandate and we now see the two mandates more in balance than they were a year ago.\u201d America\u2019s economic engine, consumer spending, has started to show some cracks. Sales at US retailers have consistently come in weaker than expected for the past few months and retailers have sounded the alarm on shoppers across the income spectrum trading down for cheaper alternatives. Recent surveys of service-providing businesses in the United States have shown that consumer demand so far this summer has been tepid, a stark contrast to last year when Americans splurged. Put together, the recent spate of economic data help build a case for the Fed to begin lowering borrowing costs. Senators talk financial regulation The Fed chief told lawmakers that a proposed set of banking regulations will likely be revised and re-proposed \u2014 a topic Republicans repeatedly brought up with Powell. Meanwhile, some Democrats talked about rules over compensation for Wall Street executives. The Fed is one of the country\u2019s key banking regulators, in addition to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, banking authorities around the world convened in Basel, Switzerland, to develop global standards for banks to fortify financial stability. Those rules are still in the process of being adopted and implemented. The final phase of these banking rules is known as Basel III Endgame, and it calls on raising the amount of capital that the largest banks hold to protect themselves against risks. The Fed\u2019s latest so-called \u201cstress test,\u201d which is a simulation of how major banks would fare in tough economic conditions, showed that all 31 banks tested would survive and still be able to lend credit. But they took a bigger financial hit\u00a0than last year. When the Basel III Endgame was proposed last year, bank interest groups\u00a0and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle\u00a0pushed back, saying that banks needing to beef up capital\u00a0beyond what\u2019s currently required\u00a0would undermine their ability to lend. Powell said Tuesday a \u201cstrongly held view of the members of the board is that we do need to put a revised proposal out for comment for some period.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what changes a new proposal would specifically have. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts grilled Powell over a long-delayed rule that aims to restrain reckless behavior on Wall Street tied to incentive-based pay for executives, known as Section 956 of the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act passed in 2010. Several regulators, including the Fed, need to figure out how to implement the rule first, but reaching a consensus among them is typically a challenge, especially considering intense lobbying efforts. \u201cThe Fed has refused to join the other financial regulators in finalizing a rule implementing Section 956 as Congress directed,\u201d Warren said. She pointed to a comment that Powell made in the past that he wants to see evidence of the problem that Section 956 would solve. Powell said that he \u201cnever said trust the banks to regulate themselves.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/business/fed-chair-powell-talks-up-progress-on-inflation-but-says-rate-cuts-not-imminent-yet/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

Gallup, in its \u201cState of the Global Workplace,\u201d estimates that low employee engagement costs the global economy $8.9 trillion, or 9% of global GDP. The report includes findings from its latest annual World Poll, which surveyed 128,278 employees in more than 140 countries last year.

Those most likely to say they feel lonely were younger workers (22%), employees who worked remotely full-time (25%) and those who felt most disengaged on the job (31%). While work isn\u2019t always the cause of a person\u2019s negative daily emotions, employers should still be concerned. That\u2019s because work can either improve or worsen employees\u2019 well-being. On the one hand,\u00a0the Gallup report noted,\u00a0\u201cwhen employees find their work and work relationships meaningful, employment is associated with high levels of daily enjoyment and low levels of all negative daily emotions. Notably, half of employees who are engaged at work are thriving in life overall.\u201d On the other, researchers found that being disengaged at work can negatively affect a person\u2019s wellbeing as much as \u2014 or more than \u2014 not having a job at all. \u201cEmployees who dislike their jobs tend to have high levels of daily stress and worry, as well as elevated levels of all other negative emotions,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOn many wellbeing items (stress, anger, worry, loneliness), being actively disengaged at work is equivalent to or worse than being unemployed.\u201d Engaged managers help workers thrive The poll found that last year only 23% of employees were engaged at work, unchanged from the year prior. Gallup defines an engaged employee as someone \u201chighly involved in and enthusiastic about their work and workplace. They are psychological \u2018owners,\u2019 drive performance and innovation, and move the organization forward.\u201d But those who said they were not engaged rose by 3 percentage points to 62%. These are employees characterized as \u201cpsychologically unattached to their work and company. Because their engagement needs are not being fully met, they are putting time but not energy or passion into their work.\u201d Engagement levels are highest in so-called \u201cbest practice\u201d organizations, where three-fourths of managers on average are engaged as well as seven in 10 non-managers, Gallup said. Their best practices include leaders\u2019 emphasizing well-being at work and in life; and putting a high priority on manager hiring and development. The manager piece of the equation is especially crucial. \u201c[W]hen managers are engaged, employees are more likely to be engaged,\u201d the report said. And, it added, \u201chigh-engagement business units are likely to see significantly higher employee wellbeing \u2014 as well as higher productivity, profitability and sales \u2014 than low-engagement teams.\u201d Where the most and least stressed workers are Engagement and well-being results varied in each of the 10 regions covered by Gallup\u2019s poll. The report noted that the United States and Canada, for example, showed the highest percentage of engaged employees (33%) among all the regions studied; and the third highest percentage of thriving employees (53%), behind Australia and New Zealand (60%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (54%). But the US and Canada also ranked second among employees experiencing daily stress (49%), right behind the Middle East and North Africa (52%). By contrast, Europe showed the lowest level of employee engagement (13%). South Asia scored lowest in terms of employees described as thriving overall (13%). And countries in post-Soviet Eurasia ranked lowest in terms of daily stress (19%).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/success/gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_economy_china-communist-party-third-plenum-economy-intl-hnk", "text": "After months of unexplained delay, top officials from China\u2019s ruling Communist Party are gathering in Beijing this week to signal the direction forward for the world\u2019s second largest economy as it faces major economic challenges and friction with the West. Stakes are high for the meeting, which takes place every five years and is known as China\u2019s third plenum. It has historically been a platform for the party\u2019s leadership to announce key economic reforms and policy directives. China is grappling with a property sector crisis, high local government debt and weak consumer demand \u2014 as well as flagging investor confidence and intensifying trade and technology tensions with the United States and Europe. Those challenges were underscored by its latest economic growth data, which were announced Monday. China\u2019s gross domestic product expanded by 4.7% in the April to June months, compared to the previous year. That represents a slowdown from the 5.3% growth reported for the first quarter and also missed the expectations of a group of economists polled by Reuters who had predicted 5.1% expansion in the second quarter. Economic problems on the back of years of stringent pandemic controls have triggered mounting social frustration, as well as questions about the direction of the country under Xi Jinping, its most powerful leader in decades. Those questions have been underscored by a recent shake-up in the upper echelons of Xi\u2019s government that saw three ministers and a handful of top military officers removed from posts or investigated, a situation that some observers of China\u2019s opaque political system believe contributed to the plenum\u2019s delay. How Xi and his top officials \ufeffchoose to address the country\u2019s economic challenges will have significant impact on whether they can continue to raise quality of life, and public confidence, within China. They could also have a broad impact on the country\u2019s role in the global economy and how willing foreign investors will be to do business there as uncertainties, including the outcome of the upcoming US presidential election, loom. Here\u2019s what to expect at the four-day gathering, which begins Monday. Big changes? About 200 members of the party\u2019s Central Committee leadership body as well as 170 alternate committee members are gathering in Beijing to approve a document laying out a plan on \u201cdeepening reform\u201d and advancing \u201cChinese-style modernization,\u201d according to state media. Past third plenums have delivered sweeping reforms. The meeting in 1978 was linked to the landmark shift toward the \u201creform and opening\u201d of China\u2019s economy, while Xi\u2019s first third plenum as leader in 2013 set in motion the move to dismantle the decades-old one child policy. But observers of China\u2019s opaque political machine don\u2019t believe there will be fundamental economic reforms this time around. Instead, they will be watching for more targeted efforts to address structural economic issues and social problems \u2014 and to enhance China\u2019s technological self-reliance at a time when it faces a raft of restrictions on access to technology driven by the US. This is Xi\u2019s third time overseeing this meeting after he extended his rule into a norm-breaking second decade at the last Party Congress in 2022. Speculation has swirled around why the meeting, which was widely expected to take place last fall, is only happening now. Some observers suggested the flagging economy and internal disagreement over how to address it, as well as the high-level personnel shake-ups that cast a shadow over Xi\u2019s third term, could have played a role. Economic challenges The high debt loads held by local governments and their shrinking income, linked to an ongoing property sector crisis, lie at the heart of China\u2019s current economic woes. They\u2019ll also be looking for signals on a new direction for real estate development and property sector policy in the wake of the industry crisis that\u2019s seen dozens of Chinese developers default on their debts, which has, in turn, devastated investors, homebuyers and construction workers. Observers will be watching for fiscal reforms, especially around taxation and government spending, that could reduce pressure on local governments and bolster their revenue. Many also say the government should take steps to boost consumer spending and increase household income, including potential reforms to change rural land ownership and China\u2019s restrictive household registration system, as well as to expand social safety nets in a country grappling with high medical costs and a rapidly aging population. Xi has acknowledged economic hardship in China, saying in a New Year\u2019s speech that \u201csome people\u201d had \u201cdifficulty finding jobs and meeting basic needs.\u201d In a May speech, he also stressed that the party should \u201cdo more practical things that benefit the people\u2019s livelihood,\u201d adding that reform should give people a sense of \u201cgain.\u201d While chasing rapid economic growth is \u201cno longer Beijing\u2019s singular priority,\u201d Asia Society Center for China Analysis experts Neil Thomas and Jing Qian wrote last week, Xi likely recognizes that his priorities of national security and tech self-reliance \u201cmust co-exist with a baseline level of growth that sustains consumption, investment, social stability, and his own political security.\u201d Tech push Tech self-reliance has become a key focus for Beijing as the US and its allies have moved to limit China\u2019s access to high-end technologies, citing their own security concerns. The plenum is expected to greenlight more government coordination around Xi\u2019s plan to build China into a \u201cscience and technology power,\u201d both in terms of innovation as well as industry. But such a focus also threatens to heighten frictions with the West. The EU and the US have recently slapped hefty tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, saying they are unfairly subsidized by the government and flooding global markets. Any moves this week that bolster the production of such high-end green technologies, which also include goods like solar panels or batteries, could further inflame the issue. Meanwhile, global investors will be looking for Beijing to make good on promises to further open up its market, even as many firms have become more wary of doing business in the country as Xi has prioritized heightened state control and security. The plenum could also see the formal ousting of top Communist Party officials who have been ensnared in opaque disciplinary investigations or removed from posts without explanation, some of whom were linked to an apparent military purge. Li Shangfu, China\u2019s former defense minister who was fired from his role in October and expelled from the Communist Party following a corruption investigation, will likely be formally removed from the Central Committee. Observers will be watching closely for any similar movement around other ousted government and military officials, including former Foreign Minister Qin Gang, People\u2019s Liberation Army Rocket Force commander Li Yuchao and his political commissar Xu Zhongbo.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/economy/china-communist-party-third-plenum-economy-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
