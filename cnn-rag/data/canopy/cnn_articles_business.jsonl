{"id": "2024_07_21_business_crowdstrike-outage-cost", "text": "The world learned relatively quickly that cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike was behind a crippling global tech outage on Friday. But figuring out who will pay the bill for the damages could take a lot longer. What one cybersecurity expert said appears to be the \u201clargest IT outage in history\u201d led to the cancellation of more than 5,000 commercial airline flights worldwide and disrupted businesses from retail sales to package deliveries to procedures at hospitals, costing revenue and staff time and productivity. The problem was caused by a few bits of CrowdStrike\u2019s own bad code in a software \u201ccontent update.\u201d Unfortunately, fixing the mistake was much more time-consuming than causing it, and it could be days before all the systems are back to normal. In a social media post late Sunday, CrowdStrike said \u201ca significant number\u201d of about 8.5 million devices affected were back online and operational. It apologized again for the disruption. While CrowdStrike has apologized, it has not mentioned whether or not it intends to provide compensation to affected customers. And when asked by CNN about whether it plans to provide compensation, its response did not address that question. Experts say they expect that there will be demands for remuneration and very possibly lawsuits. \u201cIf you\u2019re a lawyer for CrowdStrike, you\u2019re probably not going to enjoy the rest of your summer,\u201d said Dan Ives, a tech analyst for Wedbush Securities. Billion-dollar bill Experts largely agree it\u2019s too early to get a firm handle on the price tag for Friday\u2019s global internet breakdown. But those costs could easily top $1 billion, said Patrick Anderson, CEO of Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan research firm that specializes in estimating the economic cost of events like strikes and other business disruptions. His firm estimates that a recent hack of CDK Global, a software firm that serves US car dealerships, reached that $1 billion cost mark. While that outage lasted much longer, about three weeks, it was restricted to one narrow industry. \u201cThis outage is affecting far more consumers and businesses in a way that ranges from inconvenience to serious disruptions and resulted in out of pocket costs they can\u2019t get back easily,\u201d he said. Anderson added that the costs could be particularly significant for airlines, due to lost revenue from canceled flights and excess labor and fuel costs for the planes that did fly but faced significant delays. Despite CrowdStrike\u2019s dominance in the cybersecurity field, its revenue is just less than $4 billion annually. But there could be legal protections for CrowdStrike in its customer contracts to shield it from liability, according to one expert. \u201cI would guess that the contracts protect them,\u201d said James Lewis, researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Lewis pointed to case decided Thursday in favor of SolarWinds, another software company. A judge dismissed Securities and Exchange Commission charges against SolarWinds related to a Russian hack of federal government agencies in late 2020. Lewis said in that case SolarWinds was only facing charges for not disclosing its system\u2019s vulnerabilities to an outside hack, not for damage caused by its own actions. But it still won a dismissal of the case. Businesses affected by the outage are likely to find out that traditional business interruption insurance won\u2019t cover them for any of their losses, said Mark Friedlander, spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute. Those policies typically require there to be some kind of physical damage to a business\u2019 property in order for claims to be paid. There is a separate kind of policy for computer outages, known as Business Network Interruption policies, under which claims might be paid. But those polices sometimes only cover malicious hacks and exclude non-malicious computer problems like this one, he said. Will customers stay? It\u2019s also not clear how many customers CrowdStrike might lose because of Friday. Wedbush Securities\u2019 Ives estimates less than 5% of its customers might go elsewhere. \u201cThey\u2019re such an entrenched player, to move away from CrowdStrike would be a gamble,\u201d he said. It will be difficult, and not without additional costs, for many customers to switch from CrowdStrike to a competitor. But the real hit to CrowdStrike could be reputational damage that will make it difficult to win new customers. \u201cToday CrowdStrike becomes a household name, but not in a good way, and this will take time to settle down,\u201d Ives said. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said in an interview Friday morning on CNBC that the firm has been focused on fixing the continuing problems and that so far, he believed most customers had been understanding. \u201cMy goal right now is to make sure every customer is back up and running,\u201d he said. \u201cI think many of the customers understand it\u2019s a complex environment and staying one step ahead of the bad guys requires these content updates.\u201d But even if customers are understanding, it\u2019s likely that CrowdStrike\u2019s rivals will be seeking to use Friday\u2019s events to try to lure them away. \u201cIt\u2019s a very competitive business. There will be sales people from all the other companies, \u2026(jumping) in and say(ing), \u2018This has never happened to us,\u2019\u201d said said Eric O\u2019Neill, a cybersecurity expert and former FBI counterintelligence operative. \u201cThey\u2019re an excellent company doing important work. I hope they survive this. If they don\u2019t, the only winner will be the cybercriminals.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/business/crowdstrike-outage-cost/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

A cybersecurity company said the debacle is \u201cnot a security incident or cyberattack.\u201d But the technical fiasco has paralyzed airlines, banks, state agencies and even emergency services around the world. As of Friday evening, more than 3,000 flights into, out of or within the United States had been canceled and more than 11,000 delayed, according to FlightAware.com. Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina told passengers not to come to the airport unless they had confirmed their flights. Bewildered travelers at the world\u2019s busiest airport in Atlanta were stranded as they tried to get to urgent events. \u201cTomorrow, I have a funeral in the afternoon,\u201d said Ty Kelley, who was stuck at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport \u2013 which had the most cancellations Friday morning. \u201cAnd then on Sunday, I have my sister\u2019s 50th birthday party,\u201d Kelley said. But it\u2019s not clear when or if she\u2019ll make it to those events: \u201cIt\u2019s really chaotic. It\u2019s frustrating. And I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this.\u201d Live updates: Global tech outages hit airlines, banks and businesses The Federal Aviation Administration \u201cis closely monitoring a technical issue impacting IT systems at U.S. airlines,\u201d the agency posted on social media. \u201cSeveral airlines have requested FAA assistance with ground stops until the issue is resolved.\u201d CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that has Microsoft among its clients, \u201cis actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,\u201d CEO George Kurtz posted on X. \u201cThis is not a\u00a0security\u00a0incident or\u00a0cyberattack.\u201d Kurtz promised customers \u201cfull transparency\u201d on how the outage occurred. He said CrowdStrike would take steps \u201cto prevent anything like this from happening again,\u201d according to a statement on CrowdStrike\u2019s website. \u201cWe have mobilized all of CrowdStrike to help you and your teams\u201d to recover from the outage, the CEO told customers. But that could be easier said than done: Manual restarts of individual systems take time and expertise that some customers don\u2019t have, which is why companies are slow to recover from the outage. Former McAfee CEO Dave DeWalt told CNN that a group of private sector and government agencies worked overnight to \u201cascertain the threat\u201d and find a solution to the global outage.\u00a0He said he was on the call, which included the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and other private and government organizations. Microsoft released a statement midday explaining the situation. \u201cYesterday, CrowdStrike released an update that began impacting IT systems globally,\u201d Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella posted on X. \u201cWe are aware of this issue and are working closely with CrowdStrike and across the industry to provide customers technical guidance and support to safely bring their systems back online.\u201d What US airlines are saying \u2013 Delta Air Lines \u201cpaused its global flight schedule this morning due to a vendor technology issue that is impacting several airlines and businesses around the world,\u201d it said in a statement Friday morning. Delta later said it was resuming some flights. The airline apologized to impacted customers and said a travel waiver would be issued. \u2013 JetBlue operations \u201cremain normal and we are not experiencing any system-wide delays or cancelations,\u201d the airline said in an email to CNN. However, \u201cCustomers should monitor their flight status and build in extra time in the event that this outage has impacted specific airports due to outages at other airlines, airport operators, or government agencies.\u201d \u2013 American Airlines said it has resolved the issue affecting its operations. \u201cEarlier this morning, a technical issue with a vendor impacted multiple carriers, including American. As of 5 a.m. ET, we have been able to safely re-establish our operation,\u201d American said in a statement. \u201cWe apologize to our customers for the inconvenience.\u201d \u2013 Spirit Airlines said in a travel advisory its reservation system was impacted by the outage. The\u00a0airline asked passengers to check back for updates and apologized \u201cfor any inconvenience this may cause.\u201d \u2013 Southwest Airlines told CNN the outage hasn\u2019t impacted its operations. \u2013 Frontier Airlines and some competitors were brought to a standstill for hours after a\u00a0significant\u00a0Microsoft outage Thursday. The ground stop for those airlines has been lifted, and Frontier offered refunds to inconvenienced passengers. \u2013 United Airlines said it was resuming \u201csome flights\u201d early Friday morning. United cautioned travelers they might experience delays and issued waivers for eligible customers to change their travel plans. \u2013 Allegiant Air and Sun Country Airlines said they were having difficulties involving booking, check-in and trip-managing functions online. The FAA announced Friday morning all Allegiant flights would be grounded. \u2013 Numerous international airlines reported technical disruptions, including Virgin Australia and Qantas, along with airports across Europe and Asia-Pacific. Federal services and health care are stymied\n                  \n                   The calamity also struck hospitals and federal agencies, forcing each to scramble for solutions. \u201cMany of our Microsoft-based computer systems have been affected by the worldwide technology outage,\u201d Cincinnati Children\u2019s hospital posted on X. \u201cOur teams are working hard to minimize disruption to patient care and system operations, and we are bringing systems back up as quickly as possible.\u201d At Harris Health System in Houston, \u201celective hospital procedures are being canceled today and will be rescheduled when the information systems issues are resolved.\u201d At Mass General Brigham in Boston, \u201call previously scheduled non-urgent surgeries, procedures, and medical visits are cancelled today,\u201d the health care system told CNN in a statement. \u201cMass General Brigham remains open to provide care to patients with urgent health concerns in our clinics and emergency departments, and we continue to care for all patients currently receiving care in our hospitals.\u201d And in Canada\u2019s British Columbia, the Provincial Health Services Authority announced the health system was affected by the IT outage. \u201cWe have implemented contingency plans to ensure that our health care services remain operational, and that patient care is not disrupted to the best of our ability,\u201d said the organization. In addition to hospitals, blood donation centers have experienced challenges due to flight cancellations and delays. One center, Blood Assurance, told CNN that a planned shipment was postponed due to flight delays and cancellations. \u201cWe are asking community members to help through donation,\u201d Blood Assurance said in an email. \u201cWe have a fantastic community of donors that always shows up when we need them.\u201d Elsewhere, New York Blood Center, a supplier of blood to approximately 200 hospitals in the Northeast, has put in place an emergency driving operation to distribute collected blood, said Andrea Cefarelli, the senior vice president of New York Blood Center Enterprises. Test tubes of blood sent to be tested before they\u2019re distributed \u201care not making it onto planes from yesterday and today, requiring for us to drive them,\u201d Cefarelli told CNN in a phone call. \u201cThere is going to be a 12-24 hour delay in getting the test results.\u201d The American Red Cross has reassured patients and donors that they are not impacted by the global IT outage as they do not use CrowdStrike software. The US Department of Justice was searching for workarounds Friday, according to an internal memo viewed by CNN. The memo said the CrowdStrike issue \u201cis significant and there is currently no estimated restoration time.\u201d And due to the Microsoft and CrowdStrike debacle, \u201clocal Social Security offices are closed to the public today,\u201d the Social Security Administration\u2019s website said. Some 911 services went down as Portland issues an emergency declaration The technical disaster affected some 911 operations in the United States; mass transit in New York and Washington, DC; banking in Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom; Hong Kong\u2019s Disneyland; and the Israeli health service. In Oregon, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler issued an emergency declaration. \u201cCity services that rely on Microsoft Operating Systems using Crowdstrike Endpoint Protection, including certain essential City service providers, are impacted by the problem including emergency communications,\u201d the mayor\u2019s office said, though 911 operations were not impacted. But in Alaska, many\u00a0911\u00a0and non-emergency call centers weren\u2019t working properly, Alaska State Troopers said. Hours later, the agency said 911 services had been restored. In New Hampshire, some\u00a0911\u00a0services were down across the state overnight but have since been restored, New Hampshire\u00a0911\u00a0said in a\u00a0post. Phoenix police said the technical problems impacted the department\u2019s computerized\u00a0911\u00a0dispatch center. \u201cOur\u00a0911\u00a0center remains operational. If you need to call\u00a0911, stay on the line if you are put on a brief hold,\u201d Phoenix police posted on X Friday morning. Later in the morning, the department said its \u201csystems have been restored.\u201d In New York City,\u00a0911\u00a0services are operational, the mayor\u2019s press secretary told CNN. \u201cFDNY IT and Communication teams implemented our redundancy procedures upon notification of the CrowdStrike outage,\u201d New York fire department spokesperson Jim Long told CNN Friday. CNN has reached out to the Federal Communications Commission for more information on nationwide\u00a0911\u00a0outages. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of reports of a systems outage causing disruptions in service, including 911,\u201d the FCC posted late Friday morning on X. \u201cWe\u2019re working closely with other federal agencies to provide assistance and determine the extent of these service disruptions.\u201d State agencies are hit hard, too In some states, driver services ground to a halt due to the technical problems. North Carolina\u2019s driver\u2019s license and plate services are \u201cunable to assist customers this morning due to the current global Microsoft and CrowdStrike outage,\u201d the North Carolina Department of Transportation said. The agency said services will resume \u201conce the global outage has been repaired.\u201d Georgia\u2019s Department of Driver Services said operations were unavailable \u201cDue to the Microsoft/CrowdStrike Global outage.\u201d And in Tennessee, driver services centers might not be able to process transactions, state officials said Friday morning. Residents in Texas were not able to get IDs or driver\u2019s licenses on Friday. \u201cThe Department of Safety and Homeland Security will provide updates as information becomes available,\u201d the agency said. \u201cWe apologize for the inconvenience the outage has caused.\u201d In New York City, arrival information for trains and buses went down for hours before being restored Friday afternoon, according to the MTA. Some airports are \u2018absolutely insane\u2019 The situation at Philadelphia International Airport is \u201cabsolutely insane\u201d as thousands of people cram together, waiting for answers, traveler William Sikora III said. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s getting really hot in here,\u201d Sikora told CNN on Friday morning. He was trying to make the cross-country journey from Philadelphia to Los Angeles, but feared repeated delays would eventually turn into cancellations. His sentiments were echoed by would-be passengers in Atlanta, where airport officials told CNN they expected 300,000 passengers to pass through the world\u2019s busiest airport. \u201cNobody was really giving us answers. They just said our system\u2019s down, our system\u2019s down,\u201d New Jersey resident Jennifer Small told CNN. She slept at the airport overnight and has had her flight canceled twice. \u201cI want to get home to my son,\u201d Small said. But she doesn\u2019t think she\u2019ll be able to go home until Saturday. Spirit Airlines customer Miya Haney was stuck in Atlanta with her toddler daughter, trying to get to Boston for a birthday party. \u201cI\u2019m just beyond frustrated,\u201d Haney said. Spirit Airlines was using a manual check-in process, with \u201ca person going up and down shouting \u2018Boston here, flight number here,\u2019\u201d Haney said. \u201cI have no idea when we are going to get called.\u201d Hotels are also feeling the impact of the outages: Marriott International says some of its hotel systems have been impacted by the ongoing outage. \u201cWe are actively working with our vendors to resolve issues that have impacted certain hotel systems,\u201d the company, which has 8,900 properties in 141 countries and territories, said in a statement Friday afternoon. \u201cWe apologize for any inconvenience that guests may experience.\u201d This is a developing story and has been updated.

{"id": "2024_07_20_economy_china-economy-employment-blue-collar-work-intl-hnk", "text": "Leon Li used to play a discreet but indispensable part at one of China\u2019s biggest tech giants. As an administrative officer, she worked around the clock to schedule meetings, prepare documents and provide her bosses with whatever support they needed. But in February, she quit the company, forgoing a stable career and comfortable salary forsomething a little less stressful \u2014 cleaning homes. \u201cEvery morning when the alarm rang, all I could see was my dull future,\u201d she told CNN, reflecting on her office job. Li, 27, is part of a growing base of Chinese workers swapping high-pressure office jobs\u00a0for flexible blue-collar work. Many of them used to work for some of the biggest companies in the country. But these firms are slowly losing their appeal as China\u2019s economy faces headwinds\u00a0including a property crisis, declining foreign investment and slumping consumption. China\u2019s economy\u00a0grew 4.7% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024, missing economists\u2019 expectations and marking the weakest growth since the first quarter of last year, according to the\u00a0latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released on Monday. Gruelingly long hours and shrinking resources have prompted employees like Li to\u00a0rethink whether it\u2019s worth trading their time and health for higher pay. \u201cI like cleaning up. As living standards improve (across the country), the demand for housekeeping services is also surging with an ever-expanding market,\u201d said Li, who lives in the central Chinese metropolis of Wuhan. But more importantly, she feels happier. \u201cThe change it brings is that my head no longer feels\u00a0dizzy. I feel less mental pressure. And I am full of energy every day,\u201d she said. Workers reject \u2019996\u2019 culture Li is not the only white-collar worker who has found a better work-life balance by trading\u00a0an office job for manual labor. Alice Wang, 30, who is using an alias for privacy reasons, used to work for one of China\u2019s\u00a0leading live-streaming e-commerce platforms, earning 700,000 yuan ($96,310) per year. But she resigned in April, moving from Hangzhou, a picturesque tech hub, to the\u00a0more laidback city of Chengdu, where rent is cheaper, to take up pet grooming. China\u2019s notorious \u201c996\u201d work culture \u2013 the practice of working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a\u00a0week that is common among the country\u2019s tech companies, startups and other private businesses \u2013 has been a push factor for many employees who call it quits. Wang recalled feeling physically frail and \u201cvery lifeless and stagnant\u201d at her old job,\u00a0when she used to dedicate most of her time to work. But she feels different now. \u201cThe feeling of growth is relatively good,\u201d she said, adding that\u00a0she\u2019s undertaking grooming training and has ambitions to one day open her own store. \u201cThat\u2019s the longer-term plan,\u201d she said. The trend to move from professional to manual jobs comes amid surging demand for blue-collar workers, according to Chinese recruitment platform Zhaopin. In its latest survey released in June, the platform found that demand for blue-collarjobs \u2013 such as food delivery workers, truck drivers, waiters and technicians \u2013 had surged 3.8 times in the first quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2019. Demand for delivery workers grew the fastest, by 800%, after three years of Covid-related lockdowns\u00a0that gave rise to a takeout food culture. And blue-collar workers\u2019 pay has also gone up, attracting more people to jobs they might have previously avoided. The explosion of online shopping has seen the average monthly salary for a delivery worker\u00a0surge 45.3% since 2019, from 5,581 yuan ($768) to 8,109 yuan ($1,116), according to the survey. For some college graduates though, taking a manual job was not their first choice. As the economy slows, positions for fresh grads have become harder to come by in an increasingly\u00a0competitive corporate job market. The survey also found the number of people under the age of 25 who applied for blue-collar\u00a0jobs in the first quarter of this year surged 165% compared with the same period in 2019. China\u2019s unemployment rate for 16-to-24-year-olds reached a staggering 21.3% in June 2023,\u00a0according to the NBS, which subsequently suspended the release of the figure for months while it adjusted its methodology. The authorities brought back the data in January this year \u2013 excluding from the figure some\u00a062 million students, whose main task, they said, should be to study rather than look for\u00a0jobs. In recent months, the jobless rate for prospective workers aged 16 to 24 years old has hovered\u00a0between 14.2% and 15.3%, according to the NBS. Economists Larry Hu and Zhang Yuxiao, from Macquarie, wrote in a research report last year that\u00a0China\u2019s services sector, private companies and small and medium-sized enterprises used to be\u00a0the major sources of employment for young workers. However, they have been hit hard by\u00a0sluggish consumer demand. David Goodman, director of the University of Sydney\u2019s China Studies Centre, said there hadbeen a mismatch between the kind of graduates that universities churn out and what\u00a0the market really needs. He said China\u2019s economy was shifting towards advanced technology, green tech and service industries, while university education still largely focuses on manufacturing and public service, areas that are outdated or saturated. \u201c(There is) a key problem if the higher education system has not adjusted itself or beenadjusted to meet rapid changes in the structure of the economy,\u201d he explained. Pressure of another kind But some wonder if blue-collar work is truly the stress-free refuge people like Li and Wang\u00a0imagine it to be. A recent video circulated widely on Chinese social media demonstrated how things could go\u00a0wrong. The clip showed a barista in Shanghai losing his temper over a customer who\u00a0threatened to make a complaint against him. In a fit of rage, he threw coffee powder at her, instantly becoming the center of a cafe drama\u00a0that sparked an online debate about the challenges workers in the service industry face. Complaints or bad online reviews can prove disastrous for shops and restaurants in China, as\u00a0many consumers religiously follow recommendations on popular social media platforms such\u00a0as Xiaohongshu and Douyin, China\u2019s version of TikTok. The threat of a bad review puts pressure on low-paid workers to avoid doinganything that may draw negative attention to the company. Some internet users denounced the barista\u2019s poor manner. But many more sympathized with\u00a0him. \u201cThe pay is low to begin with, let alone having to face complaint. May as well just quit (when\u00a0you are) squeezed both by the company and customers,\u201d one online commenter wrote. But for Li, who works just six hours a day cleaning houses on a freelance basis, her\u00a0experience has been positive. She enjoys bonding with her clients and says each cleaning session makes her feel like more\u00a0than just a business transaction. \u201cCustomers will carefully pour water for us to drink. When it is time to eat, they will order\u00a0takeout for us, bring us food, and constantly remind us to drink water and rest,\u201d she said. So far, she said she has no regrets about quitting her office job. \u201cAfter a tiring day, I can go home and eat and do what I like without any extra mental\u00a0pressure,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/economy/china-economy-employment-blue-collar-work-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_success_buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage", "text": "Moving somewhere new when you retire isn\u2019t uncommon. But deciding whether to take out a new mortgage to buy a home is a big deal. Much of your financial life is changing as you transition from a steady paycheck to a mix of fixed and variable income and a new lifestyle. So adding a large debt to the picture isn\u2019t an easy call. That\u2019s especially true now that mortgage rates hover around 7% and home prices keep rising. \u201cAny time you take on debt, you increase risk in your situation,\u201d said Illinois-based certified financial planner Jim Stork. More than a third (35%) of homebuyers last year were between the ages of 59 and 98, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Within that group, a majority financed their purchases. Whether taking out a new mortgage makes sense for you depends on a lot of factors, including how to prove to a lender that you\u2019re a good credit risk, plus your feelings about the debt and the ongoing cost of maintaining a home. To get a mortgage, your age won\u2019t be a factor, but your income will be If you\u2019re concerned that you may be less attractive to a mortgage banker because you\u2019ve hit retirement age, know that it is illegal to discriminate against anyone applying for a mortgage based on their age. Lenders\u2019 chief focus will be on your ability to repay your mortgage with your various sources of non-paycheck income. \u201cWhen you qualify for a mortgage, it\u2019s all based on your income,\u201d said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage. That, and of course any debt you have that will soak up your income, but we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. The income sources that lenders consider, absent a regular paycheck, include: Social Security benefits, pension or annuity income, spousal benefits, disability payments, interest and dividends and your 401(k) or IRA. If a portion of your income is not subject to tax, the lender may treat it as worth 25% more. Fannie Mae offers this example: Say 15% of a $1,500 monthly Social Security benefit is tax free. That means $225 of it will not be subject to tax ($1,500 x 15%). And 25% of that amount comes to $56 ($225 x 25%). So that $56 can be added to a person\u2019s qualifying Social Security income amount ($1,500 + $56 = $1,556). If you want to use your nest egg, different methods can be used to calculate how much income it would provide. There is the asset depletion method in which your eligible assets are divided by your loan term. In the case of a 30-year mortgage, that would be 360 months. If your IRA is worth $700,000, that translates into $1,944 per month ($700,000/360). \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to take the money out \u2014 but you can use your assets [to qualify for a mortgage] as if you were going to take the distribution,\u201d Cohn said. Another option: If you are at least 59-1/2, you can start taking monthly distributions from an IRA without penalty \u2014 or a 401(k) if your plan rules permit \u2014 and the lender will count that as income so long as you show that you have sufficient funds in the account to keep taking that same monthly distribution for three years. Once you close on your home, Cohn said, you can reduce or stop taking distributions if you choose. That assumes you are not yet in your 70s when the IRS requires you to start taking minimum distributions, said Mark Luscombe, a principal analyst at Wolters, Kluwer Tax & Accounting. Burdened by debt? Lenders will also assess your debt-to-income ratio, because no matter how much income you have, the big question is how much of it will be consumed by your debts. The debt portion is composed of your expected mortgage payment plus any credit card, student loan, car loan or other outstanding debt you may have. Generally speaking, for conventional loans your DTI ratio can be up to 50%, Cohen said. That ratio falls to between 43% and 45% if you\u2019re taking out a jumbo loan, she added. A jumbo loan exceeds the conforming loan limits in the area you want to buy. But ideally your debt level will fall well below these top limits, both for the lender\u2019s sake and yours. And, of course, the higher your credit score, the better the interest rate you can get on a mortgage. What you should consider before taking out a mortgage Even before seeking a mortgage, get a good grasp on your expected monthly income and expenses in retirement. Compared to pre-retirement earnings, \u201cMost (new retirees) see a decrease in income,\u201d said certified financial planner Lori Trawinski, director of finance and employment at AARP. While some expenses may also decline \u2014 e.g., work-related costs like commuting \u2014 others may increase over time, Trawinski said, like medical costs, property taxes, home insurance and utilities. Of course, you can downsize and move to a lower-cost area. But if you stay near where you lived during your career, your expenses are likely to rise over time. Also, Trawinski noted, if you\u2019re married, consider what will happen to your household income when one spouse dies. This will help you assess your future comfort level in carrying a mortgage. \u201cPeople often fail to plan for the death of a spouse. You can take a big hit to your income when that happens,\u201d she said. If you do move to a new state or region, weigh renting first. You can get a better sense of the cost of living in the area and decide whether it\u2019s a good fit for you. As Stork put it, \u201cFlorida in August is not as fun as Florida in January.\u201d How much are you really willing to take on? All the usual financial decisions that go into homebuying apply no matter your age. But, in retirement especially, you don\u2019t want to take on more debt than necessary, since the cost of a mortgage is fixed, but the returns on your investments, the housing market and your health needs are variable. At the very least, Stork said, consider whether you can put enough money down \u2014 at least 20% \u2014 to avoid having to pay private mortgage insurance. Beyond that, consider whether you feel comfortable keeping up \u2014 and paying for \u2014 maintenance on a home. Maintenance might amount to 2% a year of your home\u2019s value, Stork said. That amounts to $10,000 a year on a $500,000 home. Maintenance is essential in preserving the value of your house should you ever decide to sell. How would your mortgage interest rate compare to a reasonable rate of return on your investments? The decision to get a mortgage was a lot easier for retirees when rates were historically low \u2014 roughly 3% \u2014 and their nest eggs were earning a lot more. \u201cBut at today\u2019s rates it\u2019s a much harder calculation,\u201d Stork said. This is especially the case if you\u2019re a very conservative investor. \u201cIf your CDs are earning 4% and a mortgage would cost you 7%, you will lose money every day on that decision,\u201d Stork explained. To get the truest reading on what makes financial sense, compare mortgage expenses to your investment returns on an after-tax basis, Stork noted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/success/buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

The volcano will be destroyed to make space for new rooms. Opened in 1989 by casino mogul Steve Wynn, the Mirage ushered in a era of luxe resorts for the Strip and was the first resort to have a sidewalk attraction \u2013 the volcano.

{"id": "2024_04_23_cars_electric-vehicle-sales-forecast-iea", "text": "Global electric vehicle sales are set to rise by more than a fifth to reach 17 million this year, powered by drivers in China, according to the International Energy Agency. In a report Tuesday, the IEA projected that \u201csurging demand\u201d for EVs over the next decade was set \u201cto remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport.\u201d It expects half of all cars sold globally to be electric by 2035, up from more than one in five this year, provided charging infrastructure keeps pace. The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs. The agency\u2019s bullish long-term outlook for EVs \u2014 based on current government policies \u2014 comes just days after the world\u2019s biggest battery EV maker Tesla slashed its prices in major markets to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers. Recent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The data \u201cdoes not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars. It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday. The growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers. The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union rose almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. In a statement, Birol said: \u201cRather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.\u201d Despite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats. In the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the world\u2019s biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States. Earlier this month, Tesla posted its first annual drop in sales in nearly four years. The company\u2019s stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year. China\u2019s BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023. Automakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the \u201cpace of the transition to EVs\u2026 will hinge on affordability.\u201d In China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average. \u201cIntensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,\u201d the IEA said. \u201cGrowing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,\u201d it added. Last year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market. \u201cChina is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,\u201d Birol said. Concerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an investigation late last year into China\u2019s state support for EV makers. The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the region\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW. EV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country. By 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA. That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year. \u201cThis shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,\u201d Birol said. The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector. In addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States. Under current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA.

The use of an AI voice for the Olympics comes as the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, sound and text.

{"id": "2024_07_22_economy_democratic-nominee-2024-economy", "text": "With his exit from the presidential race, President Joe Biden has set the stage for his Democratic successor to answer for the country\u2019s post-pandemic economic recovery. Biden\u2019s statement, posted on X Sunday afternoon, touted his administration\u2019s economic policies. \u201cToday, America has the strongest economy in the world,\u201d he wrote, adding that \u201cwe overcame \u2026 the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\u201d While the economic outlook appears somewhat more promising than the one Biden inherited in 2021, the economy is still a mixed bag, and the new Democratic nominee will have to navigate a precarious landscape ahead of the November election. Jobs remain stable so far this year The labor market remains reassuringly steady, even as job gains cooled modestly last month. The US economy\u00a0added 206,000 jobs in June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported July 5, a small dip from May\u2019s tally of 215,000 jobs. The economy remains historically strong. June marked the economy\u2019s 42nd consecutive month of job growth, the fifth-longest employment expansion on record. The unemployment rate moved slightly higher, up 0.1 percentage points to 4.1%. That marked the first time since November 2021 that the jobless rate was above 4% and also the third consecutive month that the unemployment rate increased. Job opportunities, while still above pre-pandemic levels, have shrunk, and Americans have remained unemployed for longer. The\u00a0median duration of unemployment\u00a0jumped higher \u2014 to 9.8 weeks from 8.9 weeks \u2014 and landed at a level not seen since January 2023, BLS data showed. While economists aren\u2019t too concerned about the current unemployment rate, subsequent increases as we get closer to the election could raise some concern. Interest rates remain elevated The June jobs report also indicated that wage growth is cooling, with average hourly earnings rising 0.3% for the month and slowing to a gain of 3.9% on an annual basis, its lowest rate in three years. Slowing wages could help set the stage for the\u00a0Federal Reserve\u00a0to begin cutting interest\u00a0rates\u00a0\u2014 if they also end up translating into slower\u00a0inflation. Strong wage growth can put upward pressure on prices, but\u00a0Fed\u00a0officials have said they focus primarily on\u00a0inflation\u00a0gauges to know if price hikes are under control or not. The Fed kicked off an aggressive rate-hike campaign in March 2022 in a bid to fend off a looming recession amid a post-pandemic inflation surge. But even though the coveted \u201csoft landing\u201d seems increasingly likely, in which a central bank brings inflation into line without triggering a recession or mass unemployment, the Fed has been hesitant to cut interest rates. Following a meeting in June, the central bank announced it was keeping its benchmark lending rate at its current level for the seventh time in a row, maintaining a 23-year high that has been the norm since last August. The historically high rates have put enormous strain on Americans\u2019 cost of living as they influence everything from mortgage rates to car loans. Although average rates for the standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage have fallen this year, they still remain well above 6%. Borrowing costs are poised to ease by the end of the year, but it may not be by much. Inflation is tentatively improving Along with interest rates, inflation has also been a top financial concern for Americans throughout Biden\u2019s term, as pandemic-era pressures on global supply chains and price gouging by retailers have pushed prices higher and higher since 2021. Inflation rates are nowhere near the pandemic-era peak reached in June 2022, when US inflation\u00a0hit 9.1%, its highest annual rate in more than 40 years. As of last month, annual inflation was 3%, down from 3.3% in May, according to the Consumer Price Index. Falling gas prices as well as a drop in new and used car prices helped to usher in the first month-on-month decline since May 2020, BLS data showed. On an annual basis, consumer prices are increasing at their slowest pace since June 2023, matching the lowest annual rate since early 2021. Despite the improvement, it may take time for these data points to have a palpable effect on consumer wallets, as life expenses remains overwhelmingly expensive for many who have been worn down by consistently high prices for the past three years. The Fed will also likely want to see a more consistent pattern of cooling inflation and clearer signs that inflation is trending towards the bank\u2019s 2% goal before it eases interest rates. Domestic manufacturing jobs A flagship of the Biden administration, the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act was passed in July 2022 to help companies bring chip manufacturing back to the United States and, as a result, help lower costs and prevent supply chain disruptions. Once a leader in semiconductor chip manufacturing, the United States has lost ground as countries like China ramped up production, forcing many American manufacturers to import chips \u2014 essential to the production of cars, smartphones and medical equipment. Since enacting the bill, the administration has poured billions into research and development and manufacturing in facilities across states including Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Oregon and Texas. \u201cCompanies have announced over $825 billion in investments in manufacturing and clean energy in the United States since the President took office, including in semiconductors,\u201d the White House announced in April. The new Democratic nominee could lean into the CHIPS and Science Act as a hallmark of the party\u2019s commitment to increasing domestic jobs. But the legislation comes as some manufacturing jobs have also been cut due to outsourcing. Manufacturing jobs across the country have plateaued at 13 million employees after recovering from a sharp pandemic-related downswing in 2020, according to\u00a0data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Specifically,\u00a0machinery manufacturing, which includes jobs that produce agriculture and construction equipment, has seen a decline of about 9,000 employees since the beginning of the year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/economy/democratic-nominee-2024-economy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

Gold futures settled at a record high of roughly $2462 a troy ounce on Tuesday. Encouraging inflation data last week had already led investors to raise their bets that the Fed would begin cutting rates in September. \u201cA September rate cut should be a done deal at this point,\u201d wrote Ron Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard, in a Thursday note. BNP Paribas economists last Thursday updated their\u00a0base case to reflect a rate cut in September, citing the mix of June inflation and jobs data. They\u00a0expect two quarter-point cuts in 2024.

{"id": "2024_07_22_business_delta-canceled-flights-computer-problems", "text": "Three days after a computer update problem caused more than 5,000 flight cancellations around the world in a single day, things are pretty much back to normal \u2014 except at Delta Air Lines. Atlanta-based Delta canceled more than 1,000 more flights Monday alone, according to flight tracking service FlightAware, when counting both Delta\u2019s mainline operations and Endeavor, its regional airline that feeds its system under the Delta Connection brand. Those 1,000 flights represented just over half of all flights canceled by airlines worldwide on Monday, and about three-quarters of the flights within, to or from the United States, as most carriers returned to normal operations. Other US airlines had 2% or fewer of their flights canceled. Monday\u2019s problems follow 1,500 flights that Delta canceled on Friday and nearly 3,000 more flights over the weekend. The problems likely left tens of thousands of frustrated Delta customers stranded and unable to return home, many of them being booked onto a series of flights that would subsequently be canceled as well. Lack of available hotel rooms left many forced to sleep in airports and wait for hours on hold trying to get through to Delta in an often-futile effort to find a flight. In a note to customers Sunday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian apologized for the disruptions and attributed the problem to the computer program affecting its \u201ccrew tracking\u201d software. \u201cOne of our crew tracking-related tools was affected and unable to\u00a0effectively process the unprecedented number of changes triggered by the system shutdown,\u201d he wrote in a note to customers.\u00a0\u201cOur teams have been working around the clock to recover and restore full functionality.\u201d While many airlines large and small had the CrowdStrike problem affect computers that were supposed to check in passengers, it appeared that Delta might have been the one airline that had its crucial crew scheduling software affected. At Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield International Airport on Monday, friends Nicole\u00a0DaSilva, Tiffany Denlinger and Melissa Levine had been traveling since Saturday to get home to Tucson, Arizona, after an international trip to Athens. But they were told that finding a flight for the last leg of their trip could take until Wednesday or Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on multiple different flights, and they\u2019ve all been canceled,\u201d DaSilva said, clutching a handful of tickets that could not be used. Denlinger stayed glued to her phone, waiting to speak with a Delta employee. She held up her phone to show how long she\u2019s been on hold: \u201cSix hours and 20 minutes,\u201d she said. But the problem with the critical crew tracking system was still not fixed as of Monday morning, according to a video message to Delta staff from Bastian and Rahul Samant, the company\u2019s chief information officer. \u201cSo we\u2019re optimistic we\u2019ll get it done,\u201d Samant said in the video message. \u201cThere will be some things as Ed said, that we will do today, tomorrow to get to a better place by the end of the week.\u201d He said the IT staff is working \u201cfeverishly\u201d and \u201caround the clock\u201d to fix the problem. Delta appears to still be in the dark about the whereabouts of their crew members. Crew members logging on to the company\u2019s computer system to sign up for flights receive prompts and questions that include: \u201cPlease enter below what airport code you are closest to,\u201d \u201cWhat is your current status?\u201d and \u201cPlease describe your current location.\u201d A person familiar with the airline\u2019s operations allowed CNN to see screen shots of the prompts. Delta would not comment on the screen shots. Delta is offering crew members premium pay, as well as additional assurances they will be able to travel back to their homes at the end of their work period, according to the screen shots viewed by CNN. The premium pay and assurances would be in place through Friday, another sign the staffing problem may not be fixed for several more days. Delta also declined to comment on these offers to crew members. The problems with the flight groundings and delays produced nightmares for travelers throughout the weekend. And they were only one part of the \u201clargest IT outage in history\u201d that was caused by the CrowdStrike, which shut down an estimated 8.5 million computers running Windows software worldwide, disrupting hospital operations, package deliveries, banking and retail transactions. CrowdStrike said late Sunday that \u201ca significant number\u201d of those affected computers \u201care back online and operational.\u201d But in the case of affected airlines, it is not just computers that need to be fixed. It can take longer to get crews needed to fly planes in the right cities to again staff flights. \u201cAn airline is kind of like your circulatory system. If it stops, even for just a short time, the blood isn\u2019t where it\u2019s supposed to be,\u201d said airline consultant Michael Boyd. \u201cGetting airplanes back to where they need to be, people where they need to be\u2026all of that takes time. So even if it\u2019s disrupted for only a few hours, it can take five times as long to make it right.\u201d The problem for passengers was made worse by the busy summer travel season, according to Bastian\u2019s message to Delta customers. \u201cThe technology issue occurred on the busiest travel weekend of the summer, with our booked loads exceeding 90%, limiting our reaccommodation capabilities,\u201d he wrote. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg spoke with Bastian on Sunday about the problems and taking steps to compensate passengers, according to a statement from the Department of Transportation. \u201cI have made clear to Delta that we expect the airline to provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to be rebooked, and free rebooking and timely reimbursements for food and overnight hotel stays to consumers affected by the delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance to all of their passengers,\u201d said Buttigieg in the DOT statement. \u201cNo one should be stranded at an airport overnight or stuck on hold for hours waiting to talk to a customer service agent.\u201d Bastian told Delta passengers in the message that the airline would \u201ccontinue to offer meal vouchers, hotel accommodations and transportation where available. And as a gesture of apology, we\u2019re also providing impacted customers with Delta SkyMiles and travel vouchers.\u201d The problems at Delta are similar to the problems that occurred at Southwest Airlines over the end-of-year holiday travel period in 2022 when it had to cancel nearly 17,000 flights over the course of more than a week. In that instance the problem was attributed to its crew scheduling system, which Southwest unions criticized as \u201cantiquated\u201d and which Southwest executives vowed to fix in the wake of the service meltdown.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/business/delta-canceled-flights-computer-problems/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_success_saving-under-high-interest-rates", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is an updated version of an article that originally ran on May 1. As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged for its seventh meeting in a row on Wednesday. People carrying variable-rate debt like credit cards and those seeking a loan won\u2019t be happy given that the Fed\u2019s rate, which directly and indirectly affects consumers\u2019 borrowing costs, remains at a 23-year high. Those rates will likely stay high for a while. At this point, only one cut is seen as likely before the end of the year, according to US central bankers\u2019 latest summary of economic projections. But whenever the cuts start, they may be small. \u201cAbsent a complete about-face from the economy, interest rates aren\u2019t likely to come down soon enough, or fast enough, to provide meaningful relief to borrowers. Utilize zero-percent credit card balance transfer offers, shop around for lower fixed-rate personal loans and home equity loans, and channel as much income as possible toward paying down this debt as quickly as possible,\u201d said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com\u2019s chief financial analyst. But the Fed\u2019s decision leaves savers, once again, in the catbird seat when it comes to making money on their money. \u201cSavers are enjoying the best returns on savings accounts and CDs in more than 15 years, with the most competitive offers outpacing inflation. In addition, these conditions are poised to persist for the foreseeable future,\u201d McBride said. Online high-yield savings accounts The best bang for your savings can still be had in online high-yield savings accounts at FDIC-insured banks, which yield way more than today\u2019s 0.58% overall average savings rate. As of June 11, the average online savings account rate was 4.40%, according to DepositAccounts.com. And many online high-yield accounts continue to offer rates of 5% or more. Say you have $10,000 in savings. If you leave it parked in a regular savings account at 0.5%, you\u2019ll get $50 in interest for a year. If you put it instead in a 5% high-yield account, you\u2019ll get $500. A high-yield savings account is the best place to park money you\u2019ll need to cover emergencies as well as anticipated large expenses that you have to pay in the next three months to a year. As with any savings account, banks can lower the rate they offer \u2014 also known as the APY \u2014 at any time. And you can be sure they will do just that when the Fed looks like it will finally start cutting rates, McBride said. But, he added, since rates are likely to be cut in small increments, online high-yield savings accounts may continue to offer inflation-beating returns for some time. \u201cThey will still offer the best way to preserve your [money\u2019s] buying power,\u201d McBride said. Money market accounts and money market funds Money market deposit accounts and money market mutual funds are generating yields competitive with the best high-yield savings accounts. But there are important differences. Money market deposit accounts are bank products. So, assuming your bank is FDIC insured, your account is too. (Or, if your account is at a federally backed credit union, your money will be\u00a0insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.) As with high-yield accounts, you may get the best deals at an online bank. But money market accounts may have a higher minimum deposit requirement than a high-yield account. Money market funds, by contrast, are an investment product \u2014 they generate return by investing in short-term, low-risk debt instruments and are currently yielding an average of 5.12%, according to the Crane 100 Money Fund Index. Such funds are a good place to park cash you have in your brokerage account that you may want to use at some point to buy equities or bonds, McBride said. Money market funds are not FDIC-insured, but any brokerage you use should be insured by the\u00a0Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which\u00a0covers your funds up to a limit if your brokerage ever goes under. Certificates of deposit CDs are still a great place to park any money you can leave untouched for a fixed\u00a0period of time \u2014 anywhere from a few months to five years or longer. As of June 11, the average rate was 4.971% on an online one-year CD, and 3.815% on a five-year CD, according to DepositAccounts.com. While your brick-and-mortar bank may offer a CD at a good rate, you may get a better one shopping around. The easiest way to do that without having to set up an additional account at another bank is to shop for CDs through your online brokerage, which is likely to offer a wide array of CDs from many different banks. At Schwab.com, for instance, CDs on offer ranging in duration from three months all the way up to 10 years offered average annual returns over 5%, with most ranging between 5.30% and 5.45%. The highest annual average was 5.56% for a three-month CD. If you have to withdraw money before the end of a CD\u2019s term, you can always get all of your principal back but may forfeit some of the interest earned as an early withdrawal penalty. Treasury bills and notes Beyond deposit accounts, investing in short-term Treasury bills and intermediate-term Treasury notes has been another way to earn a competitive return with virtually no risk since Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Treasury bills come in six different maturities: 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 13 weeks, 17 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks. Treasury notes mature in two, three, five, seven or 10 years. \u201cAs long as the Fed holds its rate in the 5.25% to 5.5% range, we expect most Treasury bill yields to hover around 5.25% as well,\u201d said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. But, Martin added, \u201cWhile the timing of rate cuts has been pushed back, we still expect them to arrive later this year, and investors in short-term investments would likely face reinvestment risk.\u201d That\u2019s why he suggests investors consider buying some intermediate-term investments now before rates are cut if they want to lock in a higher yield for some of their money, such as Treasury notes maturing in the next four to 10 years. On Wednesday, yields on Treasury bills were north of 5% and yields on Treasury notes were north of 4%, according to Schwab.com. When deciding whether it makes sense to invest in a CD or a Treasury for the same duration, you might opt for the Treasury if you live in a high-tax state, McBride suggested, since interest on Treasuries is\u00a0exempt from state and local taxes. In all instances, the easiest way to purchase Treasuries and other bonds is to do so through your brokerage account.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/success/saving-under-high-interest-rates/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

Biden\u00a0dropped the lawsuit\u00a0just\u00a0hours after his father, President Joe Biden, announced\u00a0his\u00a0decision\u00a0to withdraw from the 2024\u00a0presidential race, though it\u2019s not clear if the timing is related. The decision came less than a month after\u00a0the\u00a0president\u2019s son sued\u00a0Fox News, claiming the\u00a0right-wing network unlawfully published \u201cintimate images\u201d of him in a 2022 miniseries\u00a0about his legal troubles\u00a0on the\u00a0Fox Nation\u00a0streaming service. Representatives for Hunter Biden didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday.\u00a0A Fox News spokesperson declined to comment. The miniseries, \u201cThe Trial of Hunter Biden,\u201d was a six-part offering that\u00a0featured a dramatized \u201cmock trial\u201d about\u00a0Hunter\u00a0Biden\u2019s overseas financial dealings that led, in part, to his federal tax indictment and\u00a0claims\u00a0that fueled House Republicans\u2019 stalled impeachment inquiry into his father. Fox News\u00a0removed\u00a0the miniseries from\u00a0its platforms\u00a0in late April after Biden threatened to file a lawsuit. Nonetheless, he sued the network on\u00a0June 30.

{"id": "2024_07_01_media_redbox-bankruptcy", "text": "The parent company of Redbox, those distinctive, red-colored kiosks at grocery stores that sell or rent DVDs, has filed for bankruptcy after enduring months of financial struggle. Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment (CSSE) revealed in a filing that it has nearly $1 billion in debt and owes millions of dollars to several entertainment companies including the BBC and Sony Pictures, plus to retailers ranging from Walmart to Walgreens. Filings show that the company took on about $325 million in debt following its purchase of Redbox in 2022 from private equity giant Apollo Global Management. The plan was to make it into an entertainment conglomerate, combining the DVD rental business with its free streaming services, like Crackle, the entertainment platform once owned by Sony. Those plans didn\u2019t pan out, hindered by dual Hollywood strikes that limited production of fresh content and the decline of people renting physical DVDs that even forced rival Netflix to quit that part of its business last year. CSSE declined to comment. Deadline previously reported that Redbox hadn\u2019t paid employees for a week, and medical benefits have been suspended. Filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy could help the company fix those issues if its plans are approved by a court in Delaware. The company\u2019s publishing arm, which produces those ubiquitous self-help books that were once a worldwide phenomenon, isn\u2019t affected by the bankruptcy filing of its entertainment unit.

{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices", "text": "Actress Judy Garland never recorded her voice to read an audiobook of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but you\u2019ll soon be able to hear her rendition of the children\u2019s novel that inspired the movie nonetheless. Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_tech_hackers-crowdstrike-outage-scams", "text": "Cybercriminals are already capitalizing on the chaos from Friday\u2019s massive global tech outage by promoting fake websites filled with malicious software designed to compromise unsuspecting victims, according to warnings from the US government and multiple cybersecurity professionals. Hackers have been setting up phony websites meant to appeal to people seeking information on, or solutions to, the worldwide IT meltdown but in reality are designed to harvest visitors\u2019 information or to breach their devices, the security experts said. The fraudulent sites use domain names that include keywords such as CrowdStrike \u2014 the cybersecurity firm behind a faulty software update that led to the crisis \u2014 or \u201cblue screen,\u201d which is what computers affected by the CrowdStrike glitch display when they boot up. The fraudulent sites may try to lure victims in by promising a quick fix to the CrowdStrike issue or scam them with offers of fake cryptocurrency. In a bulletin about the outage, the Department of Homeland Security said it has witnessed \u201cthreat actors taking advantage of this incident for phishing and other malicious activity.\u201d \u201cRemain vigilant and only follow instructions from legitimate sources,\u201d said the bulletin issued by the Department\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. CrowdStrike has issued its own guidance on what affected organizations can do in response to the issue. The situation illustrates how a volatile, high-impact news event has created secondary risks for millions of people as malign actors try to benefit from the CrowdStrike disaster and as thousands of organizations scramble to recover from CrowdStrike\u2019s faulty software update. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty standard pattern we see following incidents on this scale,\u201d said Kenn White, an independent security researcher specializing in network security, in an interview with CNN. \u201cCriminals are tireless in their creative pursuits to exploit the most vulnerable.\u201d Amid Friday\u2019s outage, CrowdStrike itself warned of hackers trying to exploit the situation by \u201cleveraging the event as a lure.\u201d In a blog post, CrowdStrike said malicious actors are not only creating fake websites but also impersonating CrowdStrike employees in scam emails and phone calls, even selling bogus software purporting to fix the glitch. One example of that has been targeting Spanish-speaking CrowdStrike customers, the company said in a separate blog post. The attack comes in the form of a misleadingly named file called crowdstrike-hotfix.zip. When opened, the file installs malicious software that phones home to a server the hackers control and may use to give additional instructions to the malware. There is currently no automated fix for recovering from the CrowdStrike software glitch, which security experts have said will mean a long and arduous recovery that\u2019s likely to cost millions \u2014\u00a0if not billions \u2014\u00a0of dollars. \u201cCrowdStrike Intelligence recommends that organizations ensure they are communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels and they adhere to technical guidance the CrowdStrike support teams have provided,\u201d the company said. In some ways, what is currently playing out in cyberspace resembles how mis- and disinformation can overwhelm the public\u2019s understanding of events taking place in the physical world. Hackers commonly try to use high-profile news stories to funnel traffic their way. For example, after the massive Equifax data breach announced in 2017, security companies said they observed cybercriminals sending hundreds of thousands of phishing emails impersonating banks. The emails sought to prey on anxious victims who, given the Equifax news, may have been more likely to open an email from their financial institution, experts said at the time. These types of event-driven scams are taking place against the backdrop of a broader rise in impersonation scams. In recent years, the Federal Trade Commission has pointed to an uptick of scams in which cybercriminals pretend to be government officials or agencies, such as the Internal Revenue Service or the Social Security Administration. During the Covid-19 emergency, creative hackers even posed as FTC Chair Lina Khan and sent fake emails that falsely claimed the agency was distributing pandemic relief funds \u2014 prompting the FTC to plead with consumers not to respond to those messages. Americans have collectively lost hundreds of millions of dollars to these impersonation scams, the FTC has said. In a situation like the CrowdStrike outage, where people are searching for information in an urgent, fast-moving crisis and are hungry for solutions, phishing can mislead well-intentioned people and organizations into taking the wrong steps, making a bad deal even worse. Phishing dangers compound other knock-on risks, as well. Some organizations may decide on their own to weaken or even disable their cybersecurity defenses while trying to get operations back to normal. \u201cAs customers start to recover, they\u2019ll most likely disable or modify their CrowdStrike protections,\u201d said Azim Khodjibaev, a cybersecurity researcher at Cisco Talos, the cybersecurity arm of the networking company Cisco, in a post on X. \u201cThis is going to leave a whole [lot] of people exposed!\u201d If businesses start falling victim to phishing attacks that wind up compromising important data or key systems, it could have ripple effects for their corporate clients and consumers, warned Brett Callow, managing director of the cybersecurity practice at FTI Consulting. \u201cBad actors routinely try to take advantage of current events, so it\u2019s not all surprising to see them attempting to take advantage of this one,\u201d Callow said. \u201cAnd this, of course, is something that customers of companies which have experienced high profile incidents need to be ready for.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/tech/hackers-crowdstrike-outage-scams/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_business_office-building-conversion-to-apartments", "text": "Most Americans know the No. 1 rule in real estate: \u201clocation, location, location.\u201d But for some developers, there\u2019s a new winning strategy: \u201crecycle, recycle, recycle.\u201d A growing number of office buildings have found second lives as apartments, boosted by the Covid-era work-from-home movement that slashed office attendance and thinned out cities\u2019 downtowns. But breaking up sterile, expansive workspaces into inviting homes is harder than you might think. Real estate developers say these projects can be like working out a puzzle: Office buildings are designed with very different considerations than apartment dwellings. Some conversions aren\u2019t possible, and unexpected costs can add up. Even so, as office vacancies hit a record 20.1% in the United States in the second quarter of this year, according to a recent report from Moody\u2019s Analytics, and the supply of homes remains persistently below demand, local governments have upped incentives for office building conversions. These include tax breaks and speedier approval processes for real estate developers willing to remake the spaces. Nearly 70 million square feet of office space, or 1.7% of the total US supply, was in the process of being converted for other uses in the first three months of 2024, according to a recent report from commercial real estate firm CBRE. Sixty-three percent of those conversions are expected to be into multi-family housing. How does it work? At first glance, The Crosby, an apartment building that opened in 2020 in Los Angeles\u2019 Koreatown neighborhood, seems like a typical luxury high-rise. It boasts plush amenities like a fitness center and pool deck. Residents of The Crosby\u2019s 336 apartment units may not know, though, that their building was the former West Coast headquarters of oil and gas company Texaco. Converting an office space like Texaco\u2019s into luxury units requires \u201cbasically gutting everything,\u201d said Jaime Lee, CEO of Jamison Group, the building\u2019s owner, which oversaw the renovation. \u201cWe are basically clearing the floors,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just have the floors, the building shell and the elevators left.\u201d Unlike a traditional office layout, each apartment unit needs to have at least one bathroom and a kitchen, meaning plumbing must be reworked. And most office buildings have central air conditioning, so the system needs to be replaced with individual cooling and heating systems for each unit. Sometimes, the project is more costly than initially expected. \u201cEspecially for buildings that have been around for a long time and have seen lots of different tenants over the years \u2014there have been times when we\u2019ve opened up a wall and realized there is more work to be done,\u201d Lee said. Although converting unused office buildings into housing units may seem like an easy remedy for the affordable housing crisis, some office buildings (even those that are entirely empty or have multiple floors sitting empty) cannot feasibly be converted into housing, said Chris Sherman, the president of Sherman Associates, a real estate developer based in Minneapolis. \u201cOnly about 15% of office buildings here in the markets that we\u2019re based in are potentially good candidates for office-to-housing conversions,\u201d Sherman said. Older buildings are best, he said. Apartments require operable windows, which most newer buildings lack. New buildings also tend to have a larger square footage. While that may initially seem like a positive, apartment units need to have access to windows facing the exterior. To have access to natural light, the units can\u2019t stretch too far from the windows, Sherman said. \u201cYou end up with a scenario where you\u2019re not able to utilize a lot of the middle of that floor plate,\u201d Sherman said. Local governments play a role Older buildings also qualify for historic tax credits, making these conversions more financially feasible, said Sherman. The key to these conversions is local government buy-in, said Jason Ward, the co-director of the RAND Center on Housing and Homelessness. Recent tax breaks and major cities loosening zoning restrictions like the required width of apartment stairways and parking requirements have made more of these transformations possible, Ward said. In September, New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced an effort to eliminate mandates that parking spaces be included with new construction, freeing up space to build more homes. One of the largest ever office-to-residential conversions will begin construction soon: The former headquarters of Pfizer in New York\u2019s Midtown will be converted into roughly 1,500 new rental apartments. Los Angeles also recently established a faster approval process for the conversion of existing buildings that are at least 15 years old. \u201cEncouraging the reuse of buildings is a sustainable practice to extend the life of buildings and retain much of the resources that went into their initial construction,\u201d a March ordinance from the city said. Local governments aren\u2019t only pushing for office building conversions, though. John Watson, CEO of Indianapolis-based Core Redevelopment, said he has transformed abandoned schools and hotels into housing, as well. \u201cLarge office buildings are probably the most difficult to do,\u201d Watson said. \u201cHotels and schools are easy.\u201d The project Watson is most proud of, though, is the Stadium Lofts, an apartment building built from the remnants of an old baseball stadium in Indianapolis. He bought the stadium from the city for $1 and revitalized it for $28 million, including $5 million from the city. \u201cI went to the city and said, \u2018Look, this is physically possible, but I have a $5 million gap between what it\u2019s worth and what it costs,\u2019 and the city said they\u2019d fund the gap because it would help expand downtown and add to the vibrancy of the neighborhood,\u201d Watson told CNN. \u201cIt turned out to be one of the best projects I ever did.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/business/office-building-conversion-to-apartments/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

The hearing, which was held behind closed doors, found Kurmasheva guilty of spreading false information about the Russian army, making her just the latest US journalist to be convicted in the country in recent months. Kurmasheva\u2019s charge was handed down in the city of Kazan on Friday, the same day that a court in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg convicted Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich of espionage and sentenced him to 16 years in prison, following a trial condemned by his newspaper and the United States as a sham. The convictions of Kurmasheva and Gershkovich on the same day \u2013 both in rapid, closed-door trials \u2013 have raised questions about whether the Kremlin is intending to use journalists in a prisoner swap with the US. When asked about this possibility earlier Monday, spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \u201cI have no answer to this question. I leave this question unanswered.\u201d Kurmasheva, a Prague-based journalist for the US-backed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), was detained in October 2023 after allegedly failing to register as a foreign agent, while on a trip to visit her mother in Russia. She was formally accused of spreading false information in December \u2013 charges her family and employer deny. RFE/RL CEO Stephen Capus called Kurmasheva\u2019s conviction \u201ca mockery of justice\u201d and demanded her immediate release. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond time for this American citizen, our dear colleague, to be reunited with her loving family,\u201d Capus said in a statement, adding that \u201cthe only just outcome is for Alsu to be immediately released from prison by her Russian captors.\u201d Pavel Butorin, Kurmasheva\u2019s husband, reacted to the court\u2019s decision, telling CNN: \u201cMy daughters and I know Alsu has done nothing wrong. And the world knows it too. We need her home.\u201d Before her conviction, Butorin told CNN he was \u201cso confident that she would get back to us that I bought Taylor Swift tickets\u201d for August this year. \u201cLittle did we know that she would be arrested and taken away from us.\u201d Butorin told CNN that Kurmasheva had traveled to Russia to see her mother in May 2023, but was detained at the airport when trying to return home to Prague in early June. After her passports were taken, she was fined and placed under de facto \u2013 and then formal \u2013 house arrest for months, before being charged in December. Butorin had asked that the US government also declare Kurmasheva as wrongfully detained, as it has done for Gershkovich \u2013 the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Monday called for Kurmasheva to be released. Speaking at a State Department briefing, Miller called Kurmasheva a \u201cdedicated journalist who is being targeted by Russian authorities for her uncompromising commitment to speaking the truth and her principled reporting.\u201d \u201cJournalism is not a crime, as you have heard us say on a number of occasions, and we continue to make very clear that she should be released,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/media/us-russian-journalist-sentenced-to-6-5-years-in-jail-after-swift-secret-trial-in-russia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_investing_global-markets-rise-in-bidens-wake", "text": "Global markets made solid gains after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential election Sunday and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee. European stocks saw an uptick and markets in the US closed higher following Biden\u2019s announcement. The Dow ended Monday higher by 128 points, or 0.3%. The S&P 500 closed up 1.1% and the Nasdaq gained 1.6%. European markets also closed higher, and Asian markets closed mostly lower. US Treasuries rose slightly, trimming yields, and the dollar was softer against major currencies. Much of Monday\u2019s gain came from a rebound in tech stocks. Nvidia gained 4.8% while chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices was up 2.8%. Shares of CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm behind a crippling global tech outage on Friday, plunged 13.5%. The stock has lost 27% of its value since Thursday. The Trump trade falters Significant doubt about Biden\u2019s ability to beat former President Donald Trump led Wall Street to begin to price in a Trump victory in November. That became apparent with so-called Trump trades, in which investors bought up stocks they believed Trump\u2019s tariff-heavy agenda could benefit \u2014 and they likewise sold off stocks related to green energy and other industries traders believed Trump\u2019s policies could hurt. Meanwhile, a large number of economists have predicted Trump\u2019s policies would\u00a0make America\u2019s inflation problem worse, and he would balloon the US deficit. As Trump\u2019s fortunes appeared to advance in recent weeks, US Treasury prices fell and yields rose, which they often do in anticipation of higher inflation. With the Democratic party now apparently coalescing around Vice President Kamala Harris as its likely nominee, some of those Trump trades could begin to unwind \u2014 or at least go on hiatus until new polling begins to show whether or not Harris appears to stand a better chance against Trump than Biden did. With fewer than 100 days until the US election in November, Sunday\u2019s upheaval could have sent uncertain investors into a worry spiral. But \u201cthe fact that Biden endorsed Kamala Harris reduces uncertainty,\u201d said Jay Hatfield, CEO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. He expects a muted market reaction instead. Uncertainty remains Last week was exceptionally rough for markets. The S&P 500 notched its worst three-day performance of 2024 and Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 logged its worst weekly performance since October, according to Deutsche Bank data. Some analysts worry that market churn could continue as we get closer to the election. \u201cMarkets are increasingly focused on the US presidential election in November,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank\u2019s Henry Allen in a research note on Monday. \u201cBut there\u2019s heightened uncertainty about the outcome, particularly after President Biden has just become the first incumbent President to withdraw since Lyndon Johnson in 1968.\u201d Moreover, the S&P 500 has declined in every September since 2020, he said. Over the last three years, September was the worst month of the year for the index. Still, markets remain unusually strong. The S&P 500 has been higher for 28 of the last 38 weeks, something we haven\u2019t seen exceeded since 1989, he noted. Stocks tumbled\u00a0toward the end of last week as a turbulent election cycle and a global tech outage rocked technology stocks in particular.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/investing/global-markets-rise-in-bidens-wake/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_media_biden-mental-fitness", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s White House repeatedly and aggressively shot down reports\u00a0on\u00a0the president\u2019s age and any possible limitations\u00a0on his ability to perform all the duties of his office. But after his shaky debate performance last week, in which Biden routinely struggled to\u00a0get his point across, some in the White House press corps say they wish they had pushed harder to tell the story. In June, when the Wall Street Journal published a\u00a0lengthy piece\u00a0on President Joe Biden\u2019s mental\u00a0state, the newspaper\u00a0got\u00a0slammed.\u00a0The White House, its allies, and\u00a0some in the media\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources\u00a0\u2013\u00a0criticized the Journal for quoting mostly Republican political foes on the record, who had a clear political motive to damage Biden\u2019s image. No Democrats were quoted on the record making those allegations, and several Democrats complained their on-the-record quotes praising Biden\u2019s sharpness were not included. The\u00a0Journal defended its reporting at the time. Last week\u2019s debate on CNN laid bare many of the concerns the Journal\u2019s reporting had raised \u2013 that the president has good days and bad days but can sometimes seem to slip up. A New York Times report on Tuesday raised similar concerns by those who have recently been in the room with Biden. The Times reported Biden has more frequent \u201clapses,\u201d although at other times he appears sharp. After Biden\u2019s lackluster performance last week, some are questioning whether the White House press corps dropped the ball on fully covering Biden\u2019s limitations. Biden\u2019s\u00a0age issue is not secret or new. Nearly every media outlet has reported on\u00a0growing concerns about\u00a0Biden\u2019s age well before the debate. The White House in the past has complained that the coverage is disproportionate, and that the media is spending more time covering Biden\u2019s age than his accomplishments as president versus former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies. The media has faced accusations that it has not covered Biden\u2019s mental fitness more aggressively because it wants to prop up the campaign in some way \u2013 an accusation the White House reporters CNN spoke to denied. Several White House reporters\u00a0told CNN that\u00a0the\u00a0coverage\u00a0of Biden\u2019s age and his mental stamina\u00a0should have\u00a0pushed harder. They cited several difficulties in doing so before the debate \u2013 from the obvious political motivations of sources who either want to protect Biden\u2019s image or project a certain image, to the blowback from pursuing such reports, especially from the White House and Democrats. A difficult task Like all past presidents, Biden has good days and bad days. It\u00a0can be tricky to report on something as difficult to define as a person aging, when his opponent\u00a0is a convicted felon, who regularly lies and has threatened to use the government to go after his political opponents. Still, some reporters said the press corps\u00a0could\u00a0have done a better job\u00a0covering\u00a0Biden\u2019s physical and mental state. The failure of the media, one White House reporter said,\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0pushing more aggressively\u00a0into Biden\u2019s abilities after the release of the Robert Hurr report in February, which called Biden a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d Biden\u2019s age was also a right-wing talking point for years, something the White House was quick to point out to reporters,\u00a0which\u00a0may have inadvertently turned off any serious investigation. For example, deceptively edited clips of Biden from the G7 spread widely by right-wing media figures were made to seem as though he was aimlessly \u201cwandering off\u201d from fellow world leaders when really, he was speaking to parachutists who had just landed during a demonstration. \u201cThe right-wing media was calling him senile from day one, and that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cThen whenever you report on the age you were in some ways solidifying, giving credence to some people that were actually of bad faith.\u201d All the White House reporters who spoke to CNN for this piece chose to speak anonymously so they could speak more freely about their relationship with the White House. Keeping the president at a distance Reporters said the White House has not made the press corps\u2019 job easy:\u00a0The White House has put up guardrails around Biden, they say, and\u00a0he does not engage in as many interviews or planned press conferences\u00a0as previous presidents. At those events,\u00a0the press might be able to gauge how he\u2019s doing on the spot, without prepared remarks. \u201cThey keep him at arm\u2019s length, and he rarely does extended interviews,\u201d the reporter said of the White House,\u00a0although he acknowledged Biden has started giving more interviews as of late. Biden has done fewer interviews and formal press conferences than his most recent predecessors, according to data compiled by\u00a0Martha Joynt Kumar,\u00a0professor emerita of political science at Towson University who chronicles the presidents\u2019 interactions with the press. But on quick and informal interactions with the press, like shouted questions on the way to his helicopter or plane, Biden\u00a0as of this week has had 588 interactions, Kumar reports, second only to Trump when compared to recent presidents. But those interactions are not the same as an extended press conference, reporters noted. On Tuesday, ABC News announced Biden would sit down with George Stephanopoulos for an interview, his first since the debate. The White House press shop has also been very \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cfairly successful\u201d in mitigating coverage of concerns over the president\u2019s age,\u00a0said\u00a0another White House reporter who works for a different publication. \u201c[B]erating reporters who bring them reporting about age concerns, bemoaning that it\u2019s all anyone writes about (clearly, it\u2019s not) and often attacking pieces after they run,\u201d the reporter told CNN. \u201cI think that\u2019s left some folks to conclude that these stories are too painful to report or that they should pick their spots more. It\u2019s clear the age stories that have angered the White House (and the liberal Twittersphere) the most.\u201d Alex Thompson, a White House reporter for Axios, said on CNN the day after the debate that \u201cthe White House\u2019s response every single time\u00a0it\u00a0has come up for three-and-a-half years has been to deflect, to gaslight, to not tell the truth \u2013 not just to reporters, not just to other Democrats, but even at times to themselves about the president\u2019s limitations at his age.\u201d Still, this White House\u2019s recent conduct with reporters pales in comparison to Trump\u2019s team, which has done everything from revoking press access to reporters they disagree with, to calling reporters the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d The White House declined to comment. Aging doesn\u2019t happen all at once Aging is also not a sudden moment.\u00a0That makes it trickier to report on. \u201cTo some extent, the decline has appeared to be gradual \u2014 hard to notice from day to day \u2014 and that\u2019s perhaps made it harder for reporters to determine when is the right moment to write something,\u201d one of the reporters said. Just a few days before the debate, Biden held a press conference at the G7 alongside Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelensky that passed off without anything of note in Biden\u2019s demeanor. But reporters pointed out (and have published stories noting) that the president has been using teleprompters at most big events, even fundraisers where in the past he might not have. He has also started to use the lower stairs to board Air Force One. Last year, The New York Times published a lengthy piece on the \u201ccomplicated reality of America\u2019s oldest president,\u201d which looked at some of those accommodations and concerns for his age, but also the moments where he showed stamina and vigor. Some reporters said that there has been a distinct change\u00a0within the last year, and that the press corps should have reported more aggressively on the accommodations made for the president. \u201cI think the press, most of the White House press, did suffer from a bit of lack of curiosity,\u201d one of the reporters said. Look who you\u2019re up against Biden\u2019s allies will often question coverage of the president\u2019s age, questioning why reporters focus on the president\u2019s age and mental lucidity and not on Trump\u2019s\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who, at 78,\u00a0was observed falling asleep during his hush money trial, has made his own major verbal flubs and bizarre statements, and regularly spouts complete falsehoods. \u201cIt makes sense to reflect on this now and ask whether we missed or, really, under-reported the story of Biden\u2019s age and decline. But it\u2019s complicated,\u201d one of the reporters said. \u201cThe fact that the political alternative to Biden is an authoritarian who sparked an insurrection and is a convicted felon does not mean that the press is failing American democracy to focus on Biden\u2019s obvious frailty.\u201d One of the reporters said the media can, and do, report on both. Biden\u2019s allies, however, say too much attention is placed on Biden\u2019s age and not on the threat Trump could pose to American democracy. But the reporters say they can, and should, do both. \u201cJust because you are reporting on Biden age, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not reporting on Trump\u2019s lies.\u00a0 I find that argument silly, and it seems one design towards like producing a certain outcome in the election, rather than like an honest reporting,\u201d one of the reporters said. The outlets that had received harsh blowback for their previous reports on Biden\u2019s lucidity now feel justified. A source familiar with the staff behind the Wall Street Journal\u2019s report said that when the piece first published, the reporters were approached by people with sympathy asking how they\u2019re doing \u201cas if something terrible had just happened,\u201d the source said.

A software update from a single cybersecurity company, US-based CrowdStrike, was the root cause of the chaos, underlining the fragility of the global economy and its dependence on computer systems to which relatively few people give a passing thought. \u201c[M]ost people believe that when the end of the world comes, it will be AI taking over some kind of nuclear power plant and shutting down electricity,\u201d Costin Raiu, a longtime cybersecurity researcher, quipped to CNN. \u201cWhile in reality, it\u2019s more likely to be some kind of a little bit of code in a botched update, causing a cascade reaction in interdependent cloud systems.\u201d Software updates are a critical function in society to keep computers protected from hackers. But the update process itself is crucial to get right and to safeguard from tampering. An inherent \u2014 and some say misplaced \u2014 trust in that process was punctured on Friday. CrowdStrike is everywhere Numerous Fortune 500 companies use CrowdStrike\u2019s cybersecurity software to detect and block hacking threats. Computers running Microsoft Windows \u2014\u00a0one of the most popular software programs in the world \u2014 crashed because of the faulty way a code update issued by CrowdStrike is interacting with Windows. CrowdStrike, a multibillion-dollar firm, has expanded its footprint around the world in its more than decade of doing business. Many more businesses and governments are now protected from cyberthreats because of this, but the dominance of a handful of firms in the anti-virus and threat-detection marketplace creates its own risks, according to experts. \u201cWe trust cybersecurity providers widely but without diversity; we\u2019ve created fragility in our technology ecosystem,\u201d Munish Walther-Puri, the former director of cyber risk for the city of New York, told CNN. \u201c\u2018Winning\u2019 in the marketplace can aggregate risk, and then we all \u2014\u00a0consumers and companies alike \u2014 bear the costs,\u201d Walther-Puri said. CNN has requested comment from CrowdStrike. How to prevent this from happening again The wide swathe of critical infrastructure providers affected by the outage is also likely to raise fresh questions among US officials and corporate executives about whether new policy tools are needed to avoid catastrophe in the future. Anne Neuberger, a senior White House tech and cybersecurity official, spoke of the \u201crisks of consolidation\u201d in the tech supply chain when asked about the IT outage on Friday. \u201cWe need to really think about our digital resilience not just in the systems we run but in the globally connected security systems, the risks of consolidation, how we deal with that consolidation and how we ensure that if an incident does occur it can be contained and we can recover quickly,\u201d Neuberger said at the Aspen Security Forum in response to a question about the IT outage. The chaotic scenario that played out Friday did not involve a malicious actor, but government officials around the world will likely be gaming out what might have been. The infamous hack of the US government using SolarWinds software in 2020, which US officials blamed on Russia, came through a tampered software update. That hack was not nearly as disruptive but another alleged Russian hack in 2017 caused billions of dollars in damage to the global economy because malicious code spread like wildfire. The CrowdStrike episode \u201cdemonstrates the serious damage that could be inflicted by a malicious adversary if they were so minded,\u201d Tobias Feakin, a former ambassador for cybersecurity and critical technology in the Australian foreign ministry, told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/tech/tech-outage-crowdstrike-software/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_business_jd-vance-populist-pro-worker", "text": "There\u2019s a popular idea in political discourse known as the horseshoe theory. The idea is that if you map ideologies on a horseshoe-shaped spectrum, the far right and the far left are actually more closely aligned than the centrists on either side. It\u2019s not exactly a serious academic theory, but it can be a useful image when party orthodoxies are going through the kind of upheaval that we\u2019ve seen, particularly on the American right, over the past decade. And nowhere is that upheaval more apparent than in the ascendancy of Ohio Republican Sen. JD Vance, the self-styled Appalachia populist \u2014 with a Yale law degree and a deep rolodex of Silicon Valley billionaire supporters \u2014 who is now running to be Donald Trump\u2019s vice president. Vance, who is 39, is widely viewed as the vanguard of a Millennial far right that ostensibly champions blue-collar workers and chastises greedy executives (a view that Democrats and labor advocates dispute, but more on that in a moment). And he has repeatedly run afoul of the Reagan-era Republican dogma that has long made the party popular with deep-pocketed business leaders. Vance caught flak from Republicans earlier this year for complimenting Biden\u2019s top antitrust crusader, FTC chair Lina Khan. (She\u2019s \u201cone of the few people in the Biden administration that I think is doing a pretty good job,\u201d Vance said at a conference in February.) Vance has even teamed up with Wall Street\u2019s No. 1 nemesis, Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, on legislation that would crack down on big banks. Just last month, Vance himself alluded to the horseshoe-y evolution of his views, telling the New York Times\u2019 Ross Douthat: \u201cThe people on the left, I would say, whose politics I\u2019m open to \u2014 it\u2019s the Bernie Bros.\u201d Vance isn\u2019t alone in this newly business-hostile wing of the GOP. Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley is another young buck (44 is the new 24 in Congress) who\u2019s all-in on Trump and positioning himself as an advocate for workers. Last month, Hawley stood out \u2013 even among Democrats \u2013 when he publicly shamed Boeing\u2019s CEO for taking a huge pay raise while stiffing the rank and file. Investors and industry moguls aren\u2019t loving those optics for the Trump ticket. \u201cFor many business leaders, to know Vance is not to love him,\u201d wrote a group of researchers from the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute in Time magazine on Tuesday. \u201cMany of Vance\u2019s economic policy stances amount to an American\u00a0CEO\u2019s worst nightmare; a smorgasbord of populist promises which will expand government\u2019s reach into the economy, undermine global confidence, and subvert free markets.\u201d Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch and hedge fund pioneer Ken Griffin were reportedly part of that anti-Vance chorus, according to the Washington Post. Anxious CEOs may take comfort in some theories from the left, where longtime worker advocates say the Vance-Hawley Millennial Populism is little more than playacting. \u201cA Trump\u2013Vance White House is a corporate CEO\u2019s dream and a worker\u2019s nightmare,\u201c AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said in a statement Monday. \u201cSen. JD Vance likes to\u00a0play\u00a0union supporter on the picket line, but his record proves that to be a sham.\u201d Vance\u2019s short voting record \u2014 he\u2019s been in the Senate just shy of two years \u2014 doesn\u2019t\u00a0inspire a ton of confidence among labor advocates. He voted against Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, which directed hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies to American manufacturers.\u00a0According to the AFL-CIO, the nation\u2019s biggest union federation that represents some\u00a012.5 million\u00a0workers, Vance has introduced\u00a0legislation\u00a0that would allow bosses to bypass their workers\u2019 unions, and\u00a0opposed\u00a0legislation that would make it easier for workers to form unions. \u201cPro-worker is raising the minimum wage, ensuring people get overtime, supporting paid sick and family leave,\u201d Terri Gerstein, the Director of the NYU Wagner Labor Initiative, told CNN. \u201cPlayacting as working class by dressing up in jeans and acting aggrieved doesn\u2019t do anything for real working people who are struggling.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/business/jd-vance-populist-pro-worker/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_business_ryanair-fares-lower-summer", "text": "Ryanair said Monday that it expects airfares during the busy summer travel season to be \u201cmaterially lower\u201d than last year as the low-cost carrier reported a plunge in profits. Europe\u2019s biggest airline by passenger numbers, comparable in size to Delta Air Lines in the United States, said its average fare fell nearly 15% in the April-to-June quarter from the same period in 2023, to \u20ac41.93 ($45.65) from \u20ac49.07 ($53.42). Ryanair\u00a0(RYAAY) attributed that dip in the first quarter of its financial year, in part, to the timing of the Easter break this year, some of which fell over March. \u201cWhile Q2 demand is strong, pricing remains softer than we expected, and we now expect Q2 fares to be materially lower than last summer,\u201d Ryanair\u2019s chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary said in a statement, referring to the crucial July-September period. The airline previously thought fares would be \u201cflat to modestly up,\u201d he added. In a call with investors Monday, Neil Sorahan, the airline\u2019s chief financial officer, said there was \u201ca bit of push back\u201d on fares from consumers, who were spending more cautiously, according to a Reuters report. Ryanair reported a 46% fall in profits in the first quarter of the year, to \u20ac360 million ($392 million), despite a 10% rise in the number of passengers. Shares in the airline were trading more than 15% down at 6.20 a.m. ET, with other European airlines also feeling the chill. Shares in British carrier EasyJet were down 8%, and IAG, which owns several airlines including British Airways, had shed 4.4% by the same time. Ryanair\u2019s latest forecast for fares contrasts with its warning some five months ago that it might have to raise them as much as 10% during the summer, partly because of delays in aircraft deliveries by crisis-hit Boeing. Boeing has been battling a raft of safety and quality concerns in recent months. In January a piece of fuselage on a 737 Max 9 plane, operated by Alaska Airlines,\u00a0blew out mid-flight. Since then, further problems have come to light with some 737s, disrupting Boeing\u2019s production schedule. On Monday, Ryanair said its passenger numbers increased to 55.5 million in the first quarter \u201cdespite multiple Boeing delivery delays.\u201d But it also noted that it had seen \u201can improvement in the quality and frequency\u201d of deliveries from the airplane maker during that period. For the entire financial year, which runs until the end of March 2025, Ryanair expects its passenger numbers to grow to around 200 million from 184 million \u2014 that\u2019s comparable to the roughly 190 million passengers that took Delta flights last year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/business/ryanair-fares-lower-summer/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_07_19_media_evan-gershkovich-espionage-trial-verdict-intl", "text": "Evan Gershkovich, the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War, has been found guilty of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison by a Russian court, in a case that the US government, his newspaper and supporters have denounced as a sham. The court in Yekaterinburg announced the guilty verdict and sentencing on Friday shortly after 3 p.m. local time (8 a.m. ET). The court heard closing arguments and 32-year-old Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter, delivered his closing remarks behind closed doors on Friday morning. The case\u2019s rapid conclusion comes just weeks after Gershkovich first appeared in a glass cage with his head recently shaved at the start of his trial on June 26. On that day, Gershkovich stood cross-armed, occasionally smiling and waving to the crowd of reporters. The speed of the trial has raised questions over whether the Kremlin is intending to use him as part of a prisoner swap deal with the United States, suggestions which spokesman Dmitry Peskov left without comment when asked about them on a Friday conference call ahead of the verdict announcement. In June,\u00a0Moscow\u00a0confirmed again\u00a0that contacts are ongoing regarding a potential prisoner exchange deal for Gershkovich, but Peskov\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0insisted that those conversations were to be carried out in \u201cabsolute silence\u201d to prevent complications. Gershkovich was arrested while reporting for the WSJ, during a trip to Yekaterinburg in March 2023, and later accused of spying for the CIA.\u00a0Russian authorities have never offered any public evidence to support their claims. Within two weeks of his arrest in March 2023, the US State Department designated him as wrongfully detained and called for his immediate release. In a statement following Friday\u2019s sentencing, Gershkovich\u2019s employer said: \u201cThis disgraceful, sham conviction comes after Evan has spent 478 days in prison, wrongfully detained, away from his family and friends, prevented from reporting, all for doing his job as a journalist. \u201cWe will continue to do everything possible to press for Evan\u2019s release and to support his family,\u201d the statement from Dow Jones CEO and Wall Street Journal Publisher Almar Latour and Wall Street Journal Editor in Chief Emma Tucker continued. \u201cJournalism is not a crime, and we will not rest until he\u2019s released. This must end now,\u201d it added. At the United Nations Security Council on Friday, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield Ambassador also raised Gershkovich\u2019s case. \u201cLet me begin with the news coming out of Russia this morning. Evan Gershkovich was sentenced to 16 years. He has committed no crime. He is being punished because he is a journalist, and he is an American. Simple as that,\u201d she said. Journalist advocacy group, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), joined the chorus of criticism, pointing out Russia\u2019s current record as the world\u2019s fourth-worst jailer of journalists, with at least 22 currently behind bars. \u201cJournalists are not pawns in geopolitical games. It\u2019s time to stop hostage diplomacy and free him immediately,\u201d CPJ Director Carlos Martinez de la Serna said in a statement. 15 days to appeal The verdict has yet to enter into force, and the defense can appeal the conviction within 15 days, judge Andrey Mineyev said while delivering his verdict.\u00a0The court also ordered Gershkovich to pay procedural costs of 6,708 rubles ($77), and for some of his personal items, including an iPhone and a notepad, to be destroyed. According to the judge, the time Gershkovich has already spent in detention since last March will count towards his sentence. Following his arrest, Gershkovich\u00a0was held in Moscow\u2019s notorious Lefortovo prison, spending almost every hour of the day in a small cell,\u00a0before being transferred to the city of Yekaterinburg in the Urals more than 1,100 miles east of the capital. He passed the time by writing letters to his friends and family, his parents said in an interview with the WSJ, adding that he was allowed just one hour of walking per day. Gershkovich, the US government, and the WSJ have vehemently denied the charges against him. US and Western officials have accused Russia of using Gershkovich and other jailed foreigners as bargaining chips for possible prisoner exchanges. A high-profile swap\u00a0in 2022 saw US basketball star Brittney Griner exchanged for arms dealer Viktor Bout. But Russia\u00a0refused\u00a0to release another jailed US citizen, Paul Whelan, as it was seeking a former colonel from Russia\u2019s domestic spy organization in return. Whelan told CNN on Friday that he feels \u201csympathy and empathy\u201d for Gershkovich, but expressed hope that the latest developments could open the door for a deal to secure both of their release. Whelan, who called CNN from his remote prison camp in Mordovia Friday, said he was able to watch a news broadcast about the sentencing. \u201cThe only thing I could think about was, when I was standing in court, listening to the judge read the false tale of my conviction and hearing that I would have to serve 16 years in prison. And there\u2019s surreal experience of knowing that you were 100% innocent, and that\u00a0this, this, stage show, this drama was going on around you,\u201d Whelan said. Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously suggested \u201can agreement can be reached\u201d with the United States to release Gershkovich and alluded to the case of a Russian national convicted of carrying out an assassination in Berlin in 2019, in an interview with right-wing US media personality Tucker Carlson in February. The trial of Gershkovich, the American-born son of Soviet-era emigres to the US, has highlighted the extent to which Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has harmed relations between Moscow and Washington. In their indictment, Russian prosecutors said that \u201cunder instructions from the CIA\u201d and \u201cusing painstaking conspiratorial methods,\u201d Gershkovich \u201cwas collecting secret information\u201d about a Russian tank factory.

{"id": "2024_06_17_success_how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges", "text": "Long before you take your high schooler on college campus tours, consider this: Shopping for college shouldn\u2019t be any different than shopping for a home.\u00a0When you want to buy a home, you come up with a range of how much you can afford and get pre-qualified for a mortgage. Then you look in neighborhoods that offer homes that meet your family\u2019s needs and fall within your price range. \u201cAdopt a mindset that we\u2019re buying college like we\u2019re buying a house,\u201d said Beth Walker, author of \u201cBuying College Better\u201d and \u201cNever Pay Retail for College.\u201d As a financial adviser and certified\u00a0college planning specialist, Walker tries to help families avoid a situation that many find themselves in at the 11th hour: Their child applies \u2014 and gets into \u2014 schools they cannot afford because the schools won\u2019t give them enough aid. And then they just \u2026 try to make it work, no matter how much debt is involved for the parents or the student. Instead, she advises families to start as early as 9th or 10th grade in figuring out what is affordable for them as a family \u2014 so parents don\u2019t sacrifice their own financial welfare and the future college student doesn\u2019t drown in debt upon graduation. And second, she recommends assessing how a child\u2019s talents and interests pare with majors and careers they might want to pursue. Doing both those things can help you target the right colleges to apply to. Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners, defines the perfect college as one \u201cwhere a student can go be happy, safe and successful, graduate in four years or less with a marketable degree and little or no debt.\u201d In helping families align parents\u2019 affordability constraints with their student\u2019s academic and social needs, he cautions them not to automatically assume the Ivys or other high-prestige schools will be best simply because of their status. And he stresses what success in life looks like after college and notes that an Ivy League degree isn\u2019t the only path to achieving it, especially if your child won\u2019t get much aid to attend. In fact, said Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, a lot of brand-name schools don\u2019t even offer merit-based aid, only need-based. So if you\u2019re not rich, but you make too much to qualify for need-based aid, you could find yourself having to cover the entire cost of tuition, room and board every year, which is pushing $90,000 at some US colleges. Set up financial guardrails well before the college search Fothergill created a free calculator called CostHero that lets parents assess what financial resources they will have available to pay for a child\u2019s college education. It then provides a range of affordability: At the low end is the number representing what they can pay if they don\u2019t take on debt. And at the high end is the number they can pay if they also take out an unsubsidized federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). \u201cIf you\u2019re not in a position to write a check for $90,000 a year, put up guardrails for yourself so you don\u2019t blow up your retirement,\u201d he said. The calculator inputs let you set the amount of resources you\u2019re willing to use to pay for college from your income and savings, your child\u2019s earnings from summer jobs, any family gifts, and any federal Stafford loans your child may take. It also factors in if you qualify for the federal American Opportunity Tax Credit. That credit, for qualified educational expenses, will reduce your tax bill or increase any refund you have coming. The calculator also gives you a debt-to-income score like the kind a mortgage lender might use to assess whether you\u2019re a good credit risk. Ideally, he said, you don\u2019t want your housing costs to exceed 36% of your gross income and your total debt \u2014 including debt from housing, cars, credit cards and any parental education loans \u2014 to exceed 43%. If your DTI ratio is close to or higher than 43% that is a sign you could get yourself into trouble if you end up having any financial problems while your child is in college, Fothergill said. \u201cIf folks have a way to determine the range of affordability prior to the onset of the college search, the outcomes are a lot better.\u00a0 For example, if one knows that the range of affordability is between $30,000 [a year] with no parent debt and $50,000 with parent debt, then any college that comes in with a net cost in that range is, by definition, affordable,\u201d Fothergill said. Net cost refers to the true cost of attendance after figuring out how much aid your child may get (e.g., grants and scholarships). Figure out where your student may qualify for the most aid Generally speaking, the biggest tuition discounts go to the most academically accomplished students in an incoming class. \u201cThe student needs to be in the top 25% of those admitted,\u201d Walker said. Getting into that top 25% cohort is based on SAT or ACT scores, and having a high, unweighted GPA based on a rigorous high school curriculum. The curriculum\u2019s academic rigor can be further bolstered by taking AP courses. Since your child is more likely to make the top quartile at some schools than others, Fothergill and Walker both recommend your child focus on applying only to those schools in which they stand the best chances of being in that top group to maximize their chances for merit-based aid. Otherwise, you\u2018ll spend money to apply to guidance-counselor-recommended \u201csafety\u201d schools or \u201creach\u201d schools with no sense if those places are affordable to you should your child get in. Using reported data from admissions officers about their key criteria in admitting an incoming class and based on what more than 1,000 schools report about the qualifications they used to grant aid, Fothergill created another tool called ListHero. It gives students a score that helps gauge\u00a0how competitive their profile is\u00a0at a given school, relative to others admitted, and by extension their eligibility for tuition discounts. Right now the tool is only available to college planning professionals for a fee. But Fothergill plans to create a free mini-version for consumers to use. For parents doing their own research on test scores, GPA requirements, costs and aid, he recommends checking the Department of Education College Scorecard, the site CollegeData.com and the College Board. Other ways to reduce college costs before applying While your children are in high school they can take other steps to reduce the total cost of their education. One way is by doing well on the PSAT to qualify to compete for a National Merit Scholarship. Another is to take AP courses. If their high school doesn\u2019t offer them, there is a program called Freshman Year for Free offered by the Modern States Education Alliance. It provides free AP placement courses and pays the fee for students to take the AP tests or college-level preparation (CLEP) tests administered through the College Board. Getting the minimum AP scores a college requires to earn a college credit will lower how much you ultimately have to spend on tuition. A third option is to see if your state has a program that offers a year of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to a state university from which your child could earn their degree. Or, if you plan to go to any other college, make sure the school will accept the credits from a community college course you plan to take. No matter what steps you take, starting the research and budgeting process early can save everyone a lot of stress, debt and potential heartache in the end. Said Walker: \u201cWe have to be a lot more intentional about this purchase.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/success/how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

But after her shifts working near a sparkling Sleeping Beauty Castle, she went \u201chome\u201d to a car, for about four months last year, because her wages, plus earnings at two other jobs, weren\u2019t enough to afford renting a place with a bed. Now, negotiating better wages and working conditions for Carranza and thousands of other Disneyland employees has gotten messy, to the point where thousands overwhelmingly voted Friday to authorize a potential strike. Now that the vote has passed, it\u2019s up to union leadership to decide whether to hold one. It would be the first at Disney\u2019s original resort in 40 years. \u201cToday Disneyland Park cast members made their voices heard by voting to authorize the Disney Workers Rising bargaining committee to call for a strike to protest unfair labor practices by 99%,\u201d UFCW Local 324 said in a statement. \u201cWe stood up and showed Disney that we won\u2019t sit by and allow them to intimidate, surveil and unlawfully discipline cast members for exercising their rights.\u201d Disneyland Resort spokesperson Jessica Good told CNN in an email late Friday that it remains committed to reaching an agreement. \u201cWe greatly appreciate the important roles our cast members play in creating memorable experiences for our guests, and we remain committed to reaching an agreement that focuses on what matters most to them while positioning Disneyland Resort for growth and job creation,\u201d Good said. \u201cMaster Services Council\u2019s strike authorization is not unusual as part of a negotiations process, and we look forward to continuing discussions at upcoming meetings on Monday, July 22 and Tuesday, July 23. A strike date has not been scheduled, and Disneyland Resort continues to welcome guests.\u201d Disneyland officials previously said that there are plans in place that would allow the parks to continue operating with the same expected level of service, in the event of a strike. Union leaders said if the strike happens, it would likely be of limited duration, unlike open-ended strikes by actors\u2019 and writers\u2019 unions that halted film and TV productions at Disney and other media and tech companies for much of 2023. Strike authorization votes are common, and they typically pass by overwhelming margins. But that does not mean a strike will necessarily happen, as was the case with Teamsters at UPS last year. While this potential strike would officially be about Disney not allowing union buttons to be worn at work, the\u00a0underlying concern among rank-and-file workers is about the current contract that many say does not provide a livable wage. A dream of affordability Carranza \u2018s Disneyland wage is just over $20 per hour, after factoring in a differential for working the overnight shift. Her work is laborious, often dragging 600 feet of PVC hose and working with heavy machinery to buff the floors. \u201cIt\u2019s upsetting that the balloons that we sell in the park are more expensive than [what] I\u2019m making an hour. I have to work an hour and a half if I want to afford one of those Disney balloons,\u201d Carranza said. As of April 1, California\u2019s minimum wage for fast food workers is $20 per hour, which has affected other industries competing for the same workers. Voters in the city of Anaheim in Orange County, CA, where the Disneyland Resort is located, had previously approved a measure that required the resort\u2019s employees to make a $19.90 minimum wage as of January of 2024. But in a county where the 2022 median rent was $2,251 a month, and where about 10% of residents live in poverty, workers said a wage of about $20 an hour is still not enough. After Carranza lived in a car, she moved into a hotel because she could not afford a security deposit or first and last months\u2019 rent for an apartment. Today, she shares an apartment with a roommate. Change at the Disneyland Resort \u2013 and in affordability in Southern California in general \u2013 has been deeply troubling for Coleen Palmer, who has seen been at Disneyland Resort for 37 years. When she first started, Palmer says she was able to rent a $400 a month two-bedroom apartment by herself on the around $650 per month wages she earned. Today, she\u00a0rents a one-bedroom apartment for just a little over $2000 a month, and limits the groceries she buys on the $2800 she says she takes home every month. Then there\u2019s utilities, food, a phone bill, medical care, and other fixed costs. She doesn\u2019t travel anywhere besides work in order to save on gas, and buys items like chicken that can be shared with her dog. \u201cIt does feel very defeating at times. It makes me question my self-worth. And there are times when I think to myself, is it worth it? Should I go somewhere else? But I am a few years away from retirement,\u201d Palmer said. She said she wants to stick it out, especially because she loves the job. She loves talking to kids about what they\u2019ve been doing around the park and telling them they\u2019ve been brave to try the thrill rides. Palmer is happy to see the lowest wage earners get an increase due to the city\u2019s minimum wage laws. But those earning slightly more, with decades of experience, did not get a raise. Palmer said she makes just under $24 an hour after nearly four decades, while an entry-level employee makes $19.90 an hour. Disneyland officials said wages are up more than 40% in the last five years. But much of that increase has followed changes in the state and local minimum wage. Escaping reality, not confronting it A strike would involve about 9,500 employees who work at Disneyland Park, currently under a contract that expired in June. Another 4,500 employees in the same bargaining group work at the Downtown Disney retail and dining district, the Disney hotels, or the resort\u2019s other theme park, Disney California Adventure. Their contract expires in September, and they are not part of the current strike developments. Together, they represent about 40% of the entire resort\u2019s employees. But only the Disneyland Park employees will vote and participate in a strike for now. The unions and Disneyland have two more meetings scheduled on Monday and Tuesday. These groups do not include the character and parade performers who organized in May as part of Actors\u2019 Equity Association and have yet to start their bargaining process. Officially, this potential strike would be over union buttons depicting a raised Mickey fist. SEIU-USWW, Teamsters Local 495, UCFW Local 324 and BCTGM Local 83 filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board against Disney in June for what they say are hundreds of instances of unlawful discipline, intimidation and surveillance of union members wearing these buttons at work. The NLRB is expected to investigate the charges over the next few months, after which a regional NLRB director could decide if the case merits a hearing. Disneyland officials told CNN the wearing of union buttons goes against the parks\u2019 uniform policy and that only a \u201chandful\u201d of employees have been disciplined. Disneyland officials said in a statement that the parks strive to give guests \u201can uninterrupted,\u202fimmersive experience,\u201d and that \u201canything that distracts from the\u202fshow or story, be it a\u202fnon-approved\u202fbutton, pin or sticker worn by a cast member, would be addressed by a leader.\u201d The term \u201ccast member\u201d refers to any Disney employee, as the company treats any experience in front of a guest as a performance. Every employee works toward creating a space where guests escape reality and suspend disbelief, to feel as if they are truly on a Star Wars planet, for example. For the same reason, cast members are not allowed to refer to humans underneath character costumes, because this would break the fa\u00e7ade. Disney\u2019s policy is that a leader would ask the employee to remove the union button to maintain the integrity of the \u201cshow.\u201d Only\u202frepeated violations\u202fwould warrant any\u202fdisciplinary\u202faction, starting with a verbal warning.

{"id": "2024_06_13_success_gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy", "text": "Employees\u2019 negative daily emotions and lack of well-being can ultimately hurt worker engagement \u2013 and the economy, according to a new report released this week. Gallup, in its \u201cState of the Global Workplace,\u201d estimates that low employee engagement costs the global economy $8.9 trillion, or 9% of global GDP. The report includes findings from its latest annual World Poll, which surveyed 128,278 employees in more than 140 countries last year. That poll found that roughly 20% of workers globally reported feeling lonely, angry or sad on a daily basis. And 41% on average say they feel stress. Those most likely to say they feel lonely were younger workers (22%), employees who worked remotely full-time (25%) and those who felt most disengaged on the job (31%). While work isn\u2019t always the cause of a person\u2019s negative daily emotions, employers should still be concerned. That\u2019s because work can either improve or worsen employees\u2019 well-being. On the one hand,\u00a0the Gallup report noted,\u00a0\u201cwhen employees find their work and work relationships meaningful, employment is associated with high levels of daily enjoyment and low levels of all negative daily emotions. Notably, half of employees who are engaged at work are thriving in life overall.\u201d On the other, researchers found that being disengaged at work can negatively affect a person\u2019s wellbeing as much as \u2014 or more than \u2014 not having a job at all. \u201cEmployees who dislike their jobs tend to have high levels of daily stress and worry, as well as elevated levels of all other negative emotions,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOn many wellbeing items (stress, anger, worry, loneliness), being actively disengaged at work is equivalent to or worse than being unemployed.\u201d Engaged managers help workers thrive The poll found that last year only 23% of employees were engaged at work, unchanged from the year prior. Gallup defines an engaged employee as someone \u201chighly involved in and enthusiastic about their work and workplace. They are psychological \u2018owners,\u2019 drive performance and innovation, and move the organization forward.\u201d But those who said they were not engaged rose by 3 percentage points to 62%. These are employees characterized as \u201cpsychologically unattached to their work and company. Because their engagement needs are not being fully met, they are putting time but not energy or passion into their work.\u201d Engagement levels are highest in so-called \u201cbest practice\u201d organizations, where three-fourths of managers on average are engaged as well as seven in 10 non-managers, Gallup said. Their best practices include leaders\u2019 emphasizing well-being at work and in life; and putting a high priority on manager hiring and development. The manager piece of the equation is especially crucial. \u201c[W]hen managers are engaged, employees are more likely to be engaged,\u201d the report said. And, it added, \u201chigh-engagement business units are likely to see significantly higher employee wellbeing \u2014 as well as higher productivity, profitability and sales \u2014 than low-engagement teams.\u201d Where the most and least stressed workers are Engagement and well-being results varied in each of the 10 regions covered by Gallup\u2019s poll. The report noted that the United States and Canada, for example, showed the highest percentage of engaged employees (33%) among all the regions studied; and the third highest percentage of thriving employees (53%), behind Australia and New Zealand (60%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (54%). But the US and Canada also ranked second among employees experiencing daily stress (49%), right behind the Middle East and North Africa (52%). By contrast, Europe showed the lowest level of employee engagement (13%). South Asia scored lowest in terms of employees described as thriving overall (13%). And countries in post-Soviet Eurasia ranked lowest in terms of daily stress (19%).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/success/gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "nba-rights-deal-match-tnt-amazon-wbd", "text": "Warner Bros. Discovery notified the NBA on Monday that it will pay roughly $1.8 billion per year to match an offer from Amazon to carry a package of the league\u2019s games, setting up a last-second buzzer-beating attempt by TNT\u2019s parent company to retain the broadcast rights to the games. \u201cWe have reviewed the offers and matched one of them,\u201d TNT Sports said in a statement. \u201cOur matching paperwork was submitted to the league today. We look forward to the NBA executing our new contract.\u201d The announcement comes as the NBA moves to renew its contracts with media partners, agreeing to 11-year deals with Disney, NBC and Amazon Prime Video\u00a0for a reported\u00a0$76 billion. Those deals, which were approved by the NBA\u2019s Board of Governors last week, notably did not include WBD, CNN\u2019s parent company, which currently broadcasts the league\u2019s games on the TNT network and Max streaming service. The governors\u2019 signoff on the deals started the clock on a five-day window for WBD, during which it could opt to match the league\u2019s other offers. While NBC\u2019s bid for the package  currently held by WBD far surpassed the current price it pays to air the games, WBD executives have repeatedly underscored that the company retains the right to match other offers, including a new third slimmer package of games won by Amazon. A person familiar with the matter confirmed WBD\u2019s matching offer Monday was for Amazon\u2019s bid, which includes regular season and playoff games. \u201cWe\u2019ve received WBD\u2019s proposal and are in the process of reviewing it,\u201d an NBA spokesperson said. It\u2019s unclear if the NBA will accept or reject WBD\u2019s offer, which the league intended for a streaming partner. In recent weeks, WBD executives have suggested that if the NBA declines to accept its matching offer, it could bring a lawsuit. The months of dealmaking and uncertainty has set off alarms both inside and out of WBD, raising the possibility of Turner Sports\u2019 nearly four decades as an NBA partner and home to the beloved \u201cInside the NBA\u201d show could come to an end. In its statement Monday, TNT said its offer to match Amazon\u2019s deal, \u201cwill allow fans to keep enjoying our unparalleled coverage, including the best live game productions in the industry and our iconic studio shows and talent, while building on our proven 40-year commitment for many more years.\u201d The high-profile deals, months in the making, represent a massive shakeup for the league and WBD, which has aggressively marketed the NBA as a cornerstone of its streaming platform, Max, to woo audiences away from competitors. The first sign of an upending to the carriage rights came earlier this year when WBD\u2019s exclusive negotiating window with the NBA expired in April without an agreement. That allowed other companies to vie for the coveted sports rights, considered by many to\u00a0be\u00a0the crown jewel in WBD\u2019s sports portfolio. As reports emerged that the league agreed to multi-billion dollar offers from other media companies, the fate of \u201cInside the NBA\u201d\u00a0 was thrown into question. In recent months, host Charles Barkley has publicly decried what he believed was WBD\u2019s\u00a0bungling of the NBA deal. \u201cThese people I work with, they screwed this thing up, clearly; and we have zero idea what\u2019s\u00a0gonna\u00a0happen,\u201d Barkley said in May. \u201cI don\u2019t feel good, I\u2019m not\u00a0gonna\u00a0lie \u2014 especially when they came out and said we bought college football. I was like, \u2018Well damn, they could\u2019ve used that money to buy the NBA.\u201d Barkley\u2019s comments came after WBD inked a new five-year deal with Disney\u2019s ESPN to air two first-round College Football Playoff games this season and two additional quarterfinal matchups beginning in 2026, adding to the company\u2019s live sports offerings. The showdown over the NBA rights comes as legacy media companies struggle to retain audiences, with viewers opting to leave cable bundles behind in favor of cheaper, on-demand content. As streaming services like Netflix have continued to attract and further carve up audiences, live sporting events have continuously proved impervious to declines in viewership felt across traditional television. While WBD maintains the rights to the\u00a0NCAA March Madness\u00a0tournament, along with the\u00a0MLB,\u00a0NHL\u00a0and\u00a0NASCAR, the NBA remains crucial to the media conglomerate. The cable channel TNT has built a programming slate around the NBA games, most notably the highly rated \u201cInside the NBA\u201d show featuring Barkley, Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith and Shaquille O\u2019Neal. Asked last week about the fate of WBD\u2019s broadcast rights, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d \u201cMuch of it is outside my control,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/nba-rights-deal-match-tnt-amazon-wbd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_media_morning-joe-pulled-hosts-disappointed-nbc", "text": "The hosts of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d rebuked the network\u2019s leadership on Tuesday, expressing dismay over the decision to pull the flagship morning show program from the air Monday and telling viewers that they were not provided clear answers about the matter. Joe Scarborough, speaking alongside co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Willie Geist, said that the show\u2019s staff had been told on Sunday evening that all of MSNBC\u2019s lineup would be pre-empted for a single NBC News feed in the wake of the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. But, as he noted, \u201cthat did not happen.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know why that was that didn\u2019t happen. Our team was not given a good answer as to why that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Scarborough said. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d \u201cWe were also told it was going to happen throughout the day, and I guess, after there was such a strong blowback about yesterday morning, I guess they changed their plans,\u201d Scarborough added. \u201cWe were very surprised, we were very disappointed.\u201d Spokespersons for NBCUniversal News Group and MSNBC did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment on Tuesday morning. CNN\u00a0first reported\u00a0Sunday evening that Cesar Conde, the NBCUniversal News Group chairman, had made the decision to pull the top-rated morning program Monday, in conjunction with Rashida Jones, the MSNBC president, and Scarborough and Brzezinski. In the wake of the attempt on Trump\u2019s life, some of the former president\u2019s supporters have vehemently criticized the press and liberal media commentators for their hard-knuckled reporting, which has sounded the alarm on what four more years under the former president would look like. MSNBC has, in particular, been blasted by Trump\u2019s allies, putting the network in the spotlight. Some of Trump\u2019s allies have gone as far as to attack the network\u2019s parent company, Comcast. The decision to pull \u201cMorning Joe\u201d was made with that political reality in mind. A person familiar with the matter told CNN on Sunday they moved to preempt the celebrated roundtable program over concerns a guest might make an inappropriate comment that could be used to assail the program and network as a whole. Given the breaking news nature of the story, the person said, it made more sense to continue airing rolling breaking news coverage in the fraught political moment. \u201cWe want to be here for our audience, and we know you trust us, and we have ultimate respect for you guys,\u201d Geist said. \u201cSo we are here today. I wish we\u2019d been here yesterday.\u201d Brzezinski added that \u201cMorning Joe\u201d is a special program because it is \u201cthe place where you can go to have the hard conversations in a civil way.\u201d \u201cAnd so it seemed like now more than ever, is a day, a time, that we would like to be on,\u201d Brzezinski said. \u201cAnd I think our viewers agree with that.\u201d Scarborough told viewers the show\u2019s staff would cover news events in the future and threatened to quit if the program is once again pulled from the air. \u201cLet me just say, next time we\u2019re told there\u2019s going to be a news feed replacing us, we will be in our chairs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe news feed will be us, or they can get somebody else to host the show.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/media/morning-joe-pulled-hosts-disappointed-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_07_16_business_musk-trump-support", "text": "At first glance Elon Musk and Donald Trump wouldn\u2019t seem to be natural allies. One has made cutting greenhouse emissions a major business selling point. The other questions the need to cut emissions at all, denouncing most forms of clean energy as at best unnecessary and at worst destructive. One wants to move away from fossil fuels and convert all car sales worldwide to electric vehicles. The other believes EVs will be an economic disaster for America and that the nation should to produce and burn more oil. But as of Saturday, Musk is now publicly endorsing Trump\u2019s presidential reelection bid. And the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported Monday that Musk is now planning on supporting Trump\u2019s presidential campaign by committing $45 million a month to a new super PAC backing the former president. The donations, if they come to pass, are a significant development in not only the presidential campaign, but also the relationship between the two men, who both have fervent support among millions of fans who stand ready to believe most anything they say. Musk has given money to candidates from both parties in the past, including $5,000 to Barack Obama in April of 2011. He used to be primarily a Democratic donor, but those relatively paltry sums pale in comparison to the amount he is now reportedly donating to the Republican presidential candidate. He has said for several years the Democratic party has moved too far to the left for him to support many of its candidates. Musk didn\u2019t comment directly on the Journal report, but he did use a meme of people dressed as African wildebeests with the title \u201cFake Gnus,\u201d suggesting the report was incorrect. And he tweeted soon after the assassination attempt on Trump Saturday \u201cI fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.\u201d But Musk responded \u201cyeah\u201d to an account he interacts with frequently, @EndWokeness, which said that Musk \u201cwent from being an Obama voter to pledging $180 million to elect DJT. The woke left really f*cked up. Badly.\u201d The super PAC, called America PAC, aims to help register voters, persuade people to vote early and to ask for mail-in ballots in swing states, one person told the Journal. Beyond his financial support for the Trump campaign, Musk, with 190 million followers on his platform X, is possibly one of the world\u2019s most-followed \u201cinfluencers,\u201d in addition to having the greatest net worth on the planet. He has millions of fans \u2013 a recent Tesla annual meeting had the feeling of its own political rally, with shareholders telling him things like \u201cWe love you all from our bottom of the heart, we love you so much, Elon.\u201d The shareholders at that meeting voted 84% in favor of restoring the most lucrative pay package ever given to a CEO, with stock options worth $48 billion at the time of the meeting. A judge in Delaware had previously stripped him of that package. Asked at that meeting about his relationship with Trump, and Trump having nice things to say about Tesla even as he attacks EVs, Musk replied, \u201cI can be persuasive.\u201d \u201cI mean, I have had some conversations with him and he just called me out of the blue for no reason, I don\u2019t know why, but he does,\u201d Musk continued. \u201cAnd it\u2019s like he\u2019s very nice when he calls and I was like, electric cars, I think are pretty good for the future. America is the leader in electric cars, buy American stuff. And I think he actually \u2013 a lot of his friends now have Teslas and they all love it. And he\u2019s a huge fan of the Cybertruck. So I think those may be contributing factors, yeah.\u201d Relations haven\u2019t always been so friendly between the two. Musk quit two White House business councils he served on early in 2017 after Trump announced America would withdraw from Paris climate accord. \u201cClimate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\u201d he tweeted at that time. But for the last several years Musk has repeatedly shown support for Trump \u2013 or opposition to President Joe Biden. Soon after Musk purchased the social media platform then known as Twitter in the fall of 2022, he restored Trump\u2019s Twitter account. He has complained that Twitter was improperly censoring anti-Biden stories under its previous ownership, although Twitters\u2019s own lawyers later challenged that conclusion in a court filing. Tesla, the greatest source of Musk\u2019s planet-leading net worth, has benefited from subsidies passed under the Biden Administration, providing tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV buyers. But those tax credits also help established automakers seeking to sell their own EVs. Musk recently tweeted the EV subsidies passed under Biden actually helped its rivals more than Tesla. \u201cTake away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,\u201d he tweeted early Tuesday. \u201cAlso, remove subsidies from all industries!\u201d While Musk is right that some of the industries he criticizes, specifically coal and oil, receive their own massive government subsidies, his tweet doesn\u2019t acknowledge that much of his wealth has come from government support of Tesla and SpaceX, one of his other companies that depends upon government contracts to operate.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/business/musk-trump-support/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_economy_car-loan-repos-rejections", "text": "When Greg Cook\u2019s car of 12 years, a 2010 Honda Fit, up and quit on him in May 2022, he knew it would land him \u201cbetween a rock and a hard place.\u201d He couldn\u2019t afford to go without a car: He knew he\u2019d be out of work soon \u2014 federal funding ran out for the Covid-19 response position he held for two years \u2014 and that the job hunt would be challenging because he relocated to a smaller, more affordable (but more remote) town in Oregon after losing his steady performing arts job to the pandemic. \u201cWhen I\u2019m filling out an application, one of the questions I\u2019ve noticed is, \u2018Do you have reliable transportation to get to and from work?\u2019 \u2018Can you commute?\u2019\u201d said Cook, 56. But without consistent work, he feared he couldn\u2019t afford a car. Cook did the math, made a pros and cons list, and bought a new car. He locked in a low rate, but that was one of the few bright spots: Since that time, not only have the dozens of jobs applications been unfruitful; but Cook, like many other Americans, was slammed by exponentially rising prices. His car \u2014 the monthly payment, the fast-rising insurance, fuel and maintenance costs \u2014 takes up a 30% share of his monthly budget. Still, he can\u2019t afford to lose it, so he\u2019s using what odd jobs he picks up and the savings he built for a rainy day to keep current on the six-year loan. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like grabbing a few pennies out of a piggy bank every few days and eventually that piggy bank weighs a little lighter,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there seem to be more days ahead than there are pennies.\u201d Cars or trucks are lifelines for many Americans, but after three-plus years of painfully high inflation and now a slowing economy, they\u2019ve become liabilities. Delinquencies are climbing at rates not seen since the Great Recession, defaults have grown and repossessions have jumped 23% from last year, new Cox Automotive data shows. And buying a car is no cakewalk either: Credit is increasingly harder to come by and rejection rates are spiking. Waiting for interest rates to drop Fewer people are applying for credit and an increasing share are being rejected, according to the June credit access survey released last week by Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The survey, which is conducted every four months, found that the credit application rate slipped to 41.2% in June from 43.4% in February and the overall rejection rate increased to 21.4% from 18.7%. While the increase was broad-based across age groups and credit scores, the area seeing the biggest spike in rejection rates was auto loans, which shot to 18.5%, its highest on record. The one-two punch of elevated inflation and decades-high interest rates \u2014 the latter being a Federal Reserve-induced antidote for the former \u2014 have diminished consumers\u2019 appetites for loans on many big-ticket items. That\u2019s certainly been visible in the automotive industry, where loan originations were down year-over-year throughout 2023, said Jeremy Robb, senior director of economic and industry insights at Cox Automotive. Car sales did pick up a little bit in the first quarter of this year, he said, \u201cbut not a whole lot.\u201d \u201cEveryone\u2019s been waiting and hoping to see interest rates come down,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think we got a little bit of a head fake early this year \u2014 we thought inflation was coming down more quickly \u2014 and people thought rates would come down, but that didn\u2019t really happen.\u201d Lenders are wary One favorable development for the car shopper has been falling prices, especially for used cars, Robb said. Vehicle prices soared in 2021 amid fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic and its jumbling of global supply chains. In their case, the semiconductor chip shortage (a result of manufacturers reassigning capacity to consumer tech because the auto factories shuttered amid the pandemic and lower demand) led to limited production of enough cars to meet the sharp rebound in consumer demand. Although slightly cheaper cars help the affordability equation for consumers and could stir up interest, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that lenders are more willing. Instead, consumers have been presented with a higher bar, including requirements for a heftier down payment and a higher credit score, he said. More restrictive lending typically equates to approval rates going down and rejection rates rising. \u201cLenders are wary of consumer balance sheets and just the overall economy,\u201d he said. \u201cMost economic trends have been OK, but they\u2019re not great \u2026 Lenders don\u2019t want to lend to people if they\u2019re fearful they won\u2019t get their money back.\u201d Job growth has remained steady, but the unemployment rate has ticked up for three consecutive months and was at 4.1% in June, its highest since November 2021. Repossessions are rising Through the first half of this year, car repossessions are up 23% from the first six months of 2023 and 14% from 2019 levels, according to Cox Automotive data released earlier this month. Such a spike, while unnerving, might not appear as foreboding as it seems, Robb said. When the pandemic hit and fiscal stimulus flowed freely in the early months to help prop up American households and the broader economy, consumers were able to stay current on their bills. And many lenders were more amenable to working with customers who fell behind. As the economy recovered, repossessions started picking back up and returning to pre-pandemic levels. \u201cI don\u2019t want to diminish the fact that repossessions are higher and default rates are higher and delinquencies on automotive loan payments are also higher,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a lot of the trends we\u2019re seeing have gotten back a little bit toward normal.\u201d Delinquencies have accelerated at a much greater pace, nearing what was seen during the Great Recession; however, defaults haven\u2019t shown as steep a rise, Robb said. \u201cThere are more people who clearly find a way to make the payments that they\u2019re behind on and get current some way on their loan so that they don\u2019t default,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/economy/car-loan-repos-rejections/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_cars_china-baidu-apollo-go-robotaxi-anxiety-intl-hnk", "text": "In China, it\u2019s possible to travel six miles in a driverless taxi for just about 50 cents. Self-driving cars, commonly called robotaxis, are being popularized at cut-throat prices in Wuhan, a sprawling metropolis of over 11 million people in central China. It has ambitions to become the world\u2019s first driverless city, even as the vehicles often struggle to navigate the streets. \u201cYou\u2019ll never have to buy a car,\u201d a passenger inside one of the white robotaxi sedans said in a video that has been viewed over 80 million times on Chinese social media platform Weibo since last week. The fleet of 500 vehicles operating in the city belongs to Apollo Go, a unit of Chinese tech giant Baidu (BIDU). They serve an area that covers roughly half of Wuhan\u2019s population, according to a May company release. A major selling point is the price. Base fares start as low as 4 yuan (55 cents), compared with 18 yuan ($2.48) for a taxi driven by a human, state media Global Times reported on Wednesday. The service launched in 2022 and started to gain traction during\u00a0the first half of the year. The company aims to double its fleet to 1,000 cars by the end of 2024. Wuhan currently has around 17,000 regular cabs, according to the city\u2019s transport bureau. But the rapid adoption of the driverless taxis has rattled China\u2019s gig economy workforce, which has suffered from stagnant wages because of deflationary forces stalking the economy following years of tight coronavirus restrictions and a real estate crisis. \u201cWith the Chinese economy struggling a bit, Chinese people are likely much more fearful of losing their jobs, and this serves as a reminder of one of the ways that could happen,\u201d Tu Le, managing director of Sino Auto Insights, told CNN in an email interview. He added that any significant job losses could be a few years away. On Monday, the National Bureau of Statistics reported that the country\u2019s gross domestic product expanded by just 4.7% in the April to June months, a much slower pace of growth than the 5.1% expected. There have also been complaints from residents in Wuhan about traffic jams, as driverless cars fail to respond to traffic lights. Earlier this month, one robotaxi ran a red light and crashed into a pedestrian, state-run paper People\u2019s Daily reported. \u2018Stealing\u2019 livelihoods Backlash against the service, particularly against Apollo Go\u2019s allegedly predatory pricing tactics, became the second top trending topic last week on Chinese microblogging site Weibo, with more than 75 million users chiming in on the discussion last week. \u201cDisrupting the market is the least of their worries. They will steal your rice bowl,\u201d one user wrote, referring to the ability to make a living. \u201cDriving schools, road inspectors, and taxis are all going to shut down,\u201d another user said. A source at the company told CNN that discounts from companies and subsidies from local governments are commonly used during the initial launch period to get people to try new services, and the\u201cextremely low\u201d pricing could be a temporary strategy. Autonomous taxis currently operate on a relatively small scale in several cities around the world, mostly in the United States and China, while the United Arab Emirates is also welcoming companies worldwide to run driverless vehicle trials. Several US companies, including Waymo, a subsidiary of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet (GOOG), and GM (GM) subsidiary Cruise, are working on autonomous ride-sharing services but have recently faced setbacks. Cruise\u2019s permit to test fully autonomous vehicles in California was suspended in October 2023 after a series of collisions, including one that caused grievous injuries to a woman after dragging her across asphalt. The company is now being investigated by the Department of Justice. Waymo recently had to issue a recall after two of its cars hit the same tow truck within minutes of one another. Uncertainty over the safety and reliability of driverless cars has cast a long shadow over the industry in the US. But Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk isn\u2019t bothered, with the electrical vehicle giant vowing to unveil its robotaxi in the coming months. Conquering the roads China, already home to the world\u2019s biggest car market,\u00a0could someday also become the top market for automated vehicles, according to a 2023 report from consulting firm McKinsey. It projects the sector could generate between $300 billion to $400 billion in revenue by 2035 in part due to support from Beijing to roll out more pilot programs. Governments in several major Chinese cities, including Wuhan and Shenzhen, have granted commercial licenses for companies to pilot driverless services, while automakers and ride-hailing platforms are also investing in their automated fleets. Last week, authorities in Shanghai\u2019s Pudong New Area started handing out licenses to driverless car operators, including Apollo Go and Alibaba-backed AutoX, according to state media China Daily. California-based startup Pony.ai, backed by Toyota and Saudi Arabia, was also given the green light to test driverless vehicles in the financial hub. Officials in Beijing said in June that they were \u201csoliciting public opinion\u201d on regulations involving the use of autonomous vehicles for buses, taxis and car rental services. Earlier this month, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Economy and Information Technology issued draft guidelines stating that autonomous vehicles should have drivers or safety officers on board, or be able to be intercepted remotely. Any traffic violations should be handled based on local laws and regulations, it said. In the southern megacity of Shenzhen, Apollo Go was granted a license in February to run a trial in Bao\u2019an district, People\u2019s Daily reported, which allowed the company to charge. More such trials are expected across the country.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/cars/china-baidu-apollo-go-robotaxi-anxiety-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications.

According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_business_misinformation-kamala-harris", "text": "Within minutes of\u00a0President\u00a0Joe Biden endorsing\u00a0Vice President\u00a0Kamala Harris to replace him on the Democratic Party\u2019s ticket on Sunday, the internet crackled with lies, altered photos and other misleading claims about Harris. Some supporters of former President Donald Trump \u2013 the Republican nominee in the November election \u2013 even suggested Biden was the victim of a coup. Meanwhile, a slew of slickly edited pro-Harris videos quickly proliferated on social media as her backers tried to capitalize on the moment. The vitriol and counter-punches are a likely preview of the final three months of the presidential campaign, where a furious battle to shape and smear Harris\u2019 image will play out at a moment where social media platforms have weakened guardrails on disinformation. \u201cAs Kamala Harris becomes increasingly likely to be the presumptive presidential nominee for the Democratic Party and gains more public spotlight, the corresponding amount of disinformation and misleading rhetoric will grow exponentially,\u201d Erik Nisbet, a professor at Northwestern University\u2019s School of Communication, told CNN. On X, owner Elon Musk fanned an antisemitic conspiracy theory by replying to a photo of Harris and Alexander Soros, son of the billionaire megadonor George Soros, by suggesting that Harris would be a \u201cpuppet\u201d of the Soros family. Musk endorsed Trump this month and has been pumping out pro-Trump content to his roughly 190 million followers. Photoshopped images of Harris also circulated. One image of Harris posing with her husband had been edited to make it appear like the vice-president had posed with Jeffrey Epstein, the deceased financier and accused sex trafficker. On X, the hashtag \u201cShe\u2019s Indian\u201d was trending in the hours after Biden\u2019s announcement, with\u00a0some users advancing a false\u00a0\u00a0smear of Harris that she is \u201cnot\u00a0Black\u201d (Harris\u2019 mother\u00a0was born\u00a0in\u00a0India and her father\u00a0was born\u00a0in Jamaica). A review by social media analytics firm PeakMetrics of nearly 175,000 posts on X between 6 and 7 pm ET on Sunday that mentioned Harris in relation to Biden\u2019s announcement found that 8.3% of the posts used \u201cracialized\u201d language in referring to Harris, while 4.5% posts used \u201csexualized\u201d language. Biden\u2019s likeness was also exploited in the aftermath of his announcement, which came via a post on social media and not televised address. A fake expletive-laden video purportedly of Biden announcing his decision to leave the race began circulating on X. PBS News, whose logo was featured in the video, issued a statement describing the video as a \u201cdeepfake,\u201d adding, \u201cPBS News did not authorize the use of this video and we do not condone altering news video or audio in any way that could mislead the audience.\u201d On TikTok, pro-Harris videos surged, many referencing a coconut meme that has become synonymous with support of her candidacy. (In 2023, Harris gave a speech on advancing opportunities for Hispanic Americans that included a line that she attributed to her mother about understanding the context of young people\u2019s lives: \u201cYou think you just fell out of a coconut tree?\u201d) One TikTok video, a round-up of Harris memes, had over 712,000 likes and 73,000 shares. Harris\u2019 team has also embraced a viral post from British pop singer Charli XCX that referred to Harris as \u201cbrat,\u201d a concept that includes women and queer empowerment. Russian state media was also quick to react to Biden\u2019s decision to drop out. Sputnik, one of a number of pro-Kremlin mouthpieces, falsely suggested in a tweet that Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0had been a \u201ccurse\u201d on Biden. \u201cI don\u2019t think Kremlin-aligned accounts will drive conversations related to this news,\u201d Joseph Bodnar, a researcher who tracks pro-Kremlin media, told CNN. \u201cBut they\u2019re certainly happy to boost divisive domestic narratives.\u201d Foreign operatives will have a hard time outpacing the real-life twists and turns around the US presidential campaign, according to some experts. \u201cImagine being a foreign disinfo/information operations actor trying to compete with the actual news this election cycle,\u201d quipped Shane Huntley, a cyber threat intelligence expert at Google, on X.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/business/misinformation-kamala-harris/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_20_business_unmarried-couples-living-together-questions-to-ask", "text": "Taking your romantic relationship to the next level \u2014 sharing a home \u2014 is a big deal in so many ways. If you opt to live together instead of marrying, you may think you\u2019re saving money (e.g., no wedding!) and keeping your financial and legal independence from each other. In some ways you may be. But there are a lot of financial and legal considerations that you both should hash out before calling the movers. That is especially the case for couples over 50 \u2014 for whom living together may seem the easier option if they have already had long-term marriages. \u201cMy research has shown that following a gray divorce, women and men are more likely to form a cohabitation than a remarriage, signaling that cohabitation is gaining ground among older adults these days,\u201d said sociology professor Susan Brown, director of the\u00a0National Center for Family & Marriage Research at Bowling Green State University. An analysis of federal data by the Pew Research Center found that in 2016, couples over 50 represented roughly a quarter of adults living together. Those in this age group \u2014 far more than couples in their 20s and 30s \u2014 have already lived complex lives, raised families and saved for and envisioned retirement. They also, much to their chagrin, are more likely to develop health problems during their relationships from hereon out. But while some concerns may be more urgent for older couples, here are some key questions couples of any age should consider when deciding to live together: 1. What are the numbers we\u2019re working with? Mari Adam, a certified financial planner and founder of the educational consultancy Mari Talks Money, recommends partners know the financial basics about each other. This includes your income, assets, debts and credit scores. It also includes what kind of health, disability and long-term care insurance you have. And don\u2019t forget to share with your partner whether and how much you owe in alimony and child support. Surprises and secrets are never welcome in this regard. If you\u2019re the person receiving alimony or child support, figure out the potential consequences of living together on your eligibility for those payments. Every state has its own rulebook. So check in with a divorce attorney. \u201cThere can be all sorts of gotchas,\u201d Adam said. In terms of Social Security benefits, if you are divorced or widowed, you may be entitled to benefits based on your former spouse\u2019s earnings records. But the rules may change if you remarry, based on your age. If, however, you are just cohabitating, that isn\u2019t likely to interfere with your getting those benefits if you\u2019re otherwise eligible, said Steven Rubin, a certified elder care attorney at the firm Drazen Rubin Law. 2. Who pays for what? Figuring out how much each of you will pay for joint living expenses is a conversation worth having, if only to ward off potential resentments in the future. Adam has counseled people to find \u201cfair and equitable\u201d solutions. For some, that may mean splitting expenses 50/50. But for others that may not make sense. For example, if you make three times as much as your partner, you might decide to pay on a proportional basis, with each contributing the same percentage of your incomes for common expenses. Here\u2019s what that can look like: 10% of a $75,000 income ($7,500) is three times less than 10% of $225,000 ($22,500). Beyond dollars and cents, you also might consider what each partner brings to the table in terms of living together \u2014 whether it\u2019s cooking, cleaning, home repairs or taking charge of your social life as a couple. \u201cI\u2019ve seen friends and clients where the woman has money and [her male partner] doesn\u2019t. She pays all the house expenses and he is the handyman,\u201d Adam said. If your partner owns their home and you move in to that house, consider that the financial benefits of anything that improves the home\u2019s value \u2014 such as a new roof or a kitchen renovation \u2014 will only accrue to your partner, since you are not a co-owner, even though you will both enjoy the day-to-day benefits of living in an improved space. \u201cYou can solve anything. But you have to be willing to talk about it and be fair-minded about it,\u201d Adam said. \u201cThere is no one right answer.\u201d She also recommends a \u201cyours, mine and ours\u201d approach to bank accounts. \u201cIt is important to keep money separate \u2014 especially when you have kids. But have a joint account that both parties put money into [for joint living, traveling and entertaining expenses].\u201d 3. What happens if one of us gets sick? No one wants to contemplate this question. (Even writing about it is unpleasant.) But discussing it ahead of time can lessen some of the stress, should a situation arise when a partner gets sick and requires chronic care or becomes terminally ill, Rubin said. Discuss whom each of you wants to legally give a durable power of attorney to \u2014 that is the person you designate to manage your finances if you become incapacitated. Also discuss who you want to be your health care proxies. A medical proxy is the person who will make medical care decisions for you if you become unable to do so for yourself. And make clear how much and what types of medical intervention you want if you become terminally ill \u2014 that is something a proxy will be charged with respecting, even if the person\u2019s family is pushing for something different. All these wishes should be executed through a durable power of attorney form and what is sometimes called an advance health directive or living will. And if your partner is not your chosen health care proxy, include a medical release form in your health care directive naming them as someone who you, essentially, want by your side during a health crisis. \u201c[T]hat will allow doctors and hospitals to communicate with your partner, even if the partner is not the decision maker,\u201d Rubin said. \u201cI also list this in the advance directive that they want the person to have full visitation rights and the decision maker has a fiduciary responsibility to ensure your wishes are met.\u201d 4. What do you want to happen to your assets when you die? While everyone should have a will spelling out how they want their assets to be distributed, it\u2019s especially important for unmarried couples to do so since the law typically confers a lot of automatic benefits to marital spouses and a person\u2019s children than to one\u2019s live-in partner. If one or both of you have kids, both partners need to be clear about how the children and the surviving partner will (or won\u2019t) be provided for in the estate. One concern, for example, may be what happens to the home you share when one of you dies? If you own it jointly, who will inherit the deceased partner\u2019s share? If the person who dies is the sole owner, who will inherit the property? If it\u2019s not the live-in partner, then do you want to have a provision where the partner can stay in the home for a given period of time? All that can be addressed by setting up a trust for the asset, Rubin said. One area where things can get tricky with the home, Rubin said, is if the person who owns the house needs expensive long-term care and tries to qualify for Medicaid, which requires them to have very few assets.

{"id": "2024_07_17_tech_social-media-trump-assassination", "text": "The social media industry\u2019s tepid response this week to the conspiracy theories floating wildly on their platforms about the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump was part of a purposeful shift away from actively policing online speech \u2013 even in the face of potentially dangerous rhetoric. The reaction could not be more different from 2021, in wake of the country\u2019s last brush with political violence.\u00a0That does not bode well for the coming election \u2013 or its aftermath. Three years ago, major online platforms including Meta, Twitter and YouTube took swift action to keep the attack on America\u2019s democracy on January 6 from spiraling online \u2013 suspending thousands of accounts that had promoted election lies, extending a pause on political advertising and removing posts that praised the US Capitol attack, among other moves. In stark contrast, however, social media platforms over the past few days have been overrun by false claims about the attempt on Trump\u2019s life, ranging from baseless left-wing speculation that the incident had been \u201cstaged\u201d for Trump\u2019s own political benefit to right-wing conspiracy theories falsely suggesting \u201cdeep state\u201d government agents or perhaps President Joe Biden himself had somehow orchestrated the attack. The incident was not staged. The US Secret Service has described it as an assassination attempt and the Department of Homeland Security has acknowledged it as a security failure. Investigators are still searching for the shooter\u2019s motive. And Biden condemned political violence following the attack, pledging an independent investigation into the security lapse as well. Big Tech CEOs have universally echoed Biden\u2019s remarks. But amid the torrent of conspiracy theorizing, the social media platforms have been largely silent about their own role in how the event has played out online, reflecting a sharp departure from their previous hands-on approach to containing the spread of falsehoods that, left unchecked, could risk fueling further conflict. None of the country\u2019s largest social media platforms responded to repeated questions from CNN over multiple days this week about what actions they have taken in response to misinformation and conspiracy theories circulating about the Trump rally shooting. Meta, Google, TikTok and X did not respond. Only Snapchat issued a statement saying it is designed \u201cdifferently from traditional social media\u201d in that it doesn\u2019t offer a curated news feed \u201cwhere users can broadcast false information.\u201d The steadfast silence from tech platforms underscores how significantly industry giants have shifted in the past three years to embrace a more hands-off approach \u2014 in their latest attempt to juggle, in real time, competing values of free expression, online safety and political neutrality. And what the public experienced on social media in the moments after the attack on Trump is a sign of what\u2019s to come, said Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a social media watchdog group that advocates for tighter regulation of the platforms. \u201cThis should be a hint,\u201d Ahmed said, \u201cthat the months ahead are going to be just as unedifying, as stultifyingly stupid and as confusing as the last few days have been on social media.\u201d How did we get here? A dizzying array of factors have combined to create today\u2019s more toxic information environment. Most visibly, Elon Musk\u2019s purchase of Twitter, now known as X, has transformed what was once the premier social media destination for breaking news into a messier, less trustworthy platform. Musk has made multiple interlocking decisions around account verification, payments to creators, and whom to allow on the platform that have degraded users\u2019 ability to trust each other and what they see there, misinformation researchers have long said.\u00a0And he has erected barriers to independent accountability by forcing researchers to pay astronomical fees for access to the platform\u2019s data. Users on X are now being financially rewarded for posting the most inflammatory, engaging content regardless of its accuracy or truthfulness. Although Musk has touted X\u2019s crowdbased fact-checking feature, Community Notes, as a bulwark against misinformation, it has been widely criticized as slow and ineffective. On Tuesday, CCDH published new research finding that of 100 top-performing conspiracy theory posts on X about Trump\u2019s shooting, only five contained a Community Note refuting a false claim. The posts collectively garnered more than 215 million views on X, according to CCDH. Soon after Musk bought the platform, he laid off roughly 80% of Twitter\u2019s pre-acquisition headcount. The deep cuts affected the company\u2019s trust and safety team responsible for safeguarding the platform and, in a separate move, Musk eliminated Twitter\u2019s trust and safety council of outside experts. But X wasn\u2019t alone in reducing investments in trust and safety. Industrywide, companies cited tough macroeconomic conditions to justify sweeping layoffs that in some cases have hit trust and safety teams. In 2019, Snapchat had 763 employees working on trust and safety, a number that grew to more than 3,000 by 2021, the company told Congress this year. But by 2023, that figure had fallen 27% to 2,226.\u00a0Meta and TikTok told lawmakers they each employ roughly 40,000 safety employees but did not disclose how that number has changed over time. Social media companies retreated in other ways, too, from YouTube deciding to once again allow lies about the 2020 election on its platform to Meta deciding to stop amplifying news, politics and social issues in its curated feeds altogether. \u201cMeta decided that it can\u2019t profitably deliver civic content,\u201d said Laura Edelson, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University and the co-director of Cybersecurity for Democracy, a research group focused on digital misinformation.\u00a0\u201cIt can\u2019t make a safe social media product that does politics and civic stuff, and so it just got out of that business.\u201d Baybars Orsek, managing director of the fact-checking organization Logically Facts, said these and other changes by social media platforms have made working with them in the last few years more challenging. \u201cIt is concerning to see that some platforms have chosen to distance themselves from political discourse rather than enforce transparent and scalable policies to protect free speech while maintaining a safe information environment,\u201d Orsek told CNN. It isn\u2019t just the companies\u2019 own business decisions driving the shift. Since the 2020 election, researchers who study digital platforms have increasingly reported being harassed and intimidated, in some cases by US lawmakers who have baselessly alleged they are part of a government-led pressure campaign to silence right-wing speech on social media. For years, some conservatives have said, the US government in regular meetings and emails with social media companies has pressured platforms to remove Covid-19 and election misinformation in violation of Americans\u2019 First Amendment rights. Those claims reached a climax this year at the Supreme Court, where, in a closely watched ruling, a 6-3 majority declined to say that government efforts to persuade platforms to remove posts is unconstitutional. The decision effectively means the US government can continue\u00a0to flag misinformation threats to social media companies in the runup to the 2024 election. But it is still up to the companies to decide what to do with that information. And the Trump rally shooting now raises fresh questions about their willingness to act on it, especially against the backdrop of a sustained effort by right-wing social media critics to discredit trust and safety work and misinformation research. How this all played out on Saturday The combination of all these factors led to ripe conditions for a misinformation maelstrom surrounding the Trump assassination attempt. The incident touched off an intense demand for information. Mainstream media outlets, taking\u00a0care to\u00a0report only credible\u00a0answers, were initially slower to report what was happening than the breakneck pace of social media speculation. That led to what researchers call an information void: a gap between what is known and what audiences want to know. Meta\u2019s decision not to amplify news and politics in curated feeds \u2013 part of a broader industry retrenchment on trust and safety driven by internal business pressures and external cultural ones \u2013\u00a0may have helped prevent some people from going down algorithmically recommended rabbit holes, at least on company-owned platforms. But in the minutes after the shooting, some Threads users complained that mentions of the incident could not immediately be found on the site, in direct contrast to X \u2013 where, thanks in part\u00a0to Musk\u2019s prior decisions \u2013\u00a0conspiratorial thinking was already flowing fast and free. Meta\u2019s pullback from promoting news\u00a0content likely contributed to the information void, Edelson said, as it failed to sufficiently elevate authoritative reporting and likely drove users into the arms of conspiracy theorists on other platforms. The decision highlights the difficult tradeoffs of managing a fast-moving information ecosystem, said Orsek. \u201cThe lack of stringent content moderation on X has led to a proliferation of misinformation, whereas Meta\u2019s more conservative strategy has resulted in less immediate information [on its platforms], both verified and unverified,\u201d Orsek said. (The Verge reported Saturday that Meta did appear to be surfacing news outlets\u2019 reporting about the shooting in Facebook search results, but that it inconsistently showed conspiracy-related content at the top of its trending topic on Threads for the incident.) Meanwhile, Edelson added, TikTok also emerged as a key spreader of misinformation due to the way its recommendation algorithm surfaced videos it believed would resonate with users, rather than primarily authoritative information. For other social media users, the episode highlighted how X remains the platform of choice for following big breaking news events online, even if the quality of the information is degraded. And the near-instant calcification of pro-Trump and anti-Trump false narratives surrounding the shooting shows how Americans are primed to look at the same event through completely different lenses, irrespective of the underlying facts. The eagerness with which people on the right and, increasingly, on the left have embraced misleading claims linked to the shooting is a worrying sign for civil discourse and democracy, some researchers say. That includes Alicia Wanless, director of the Information Environment Project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who has been researching how people create their own realities from the information they consume and the technology they use. \u201cI\u2019ve been finding a pattern that after new technologies change how humans can produce and share information,\u201d Wanless said, it leads to clashes of different realities in which supporters of various sides and ideologies try to do ever more to convince audiences that their narrative is the truth. Historically, if the tension between realities can\u2019t be resolved, Wanless warned, it often leads to violence. \u201cAll my case studies led up to conflict,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/tech/social-media-trump-assassination/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}

How did the crash unfold? Which systems have recovered, and which ones are still affected? We break it down. (All times Eastern Time.) Late Thursday night and early Friday, 911 centers and transportation services are disrupted Overnight on Thursday and into Friday, several states, including Alaska and Arizona, experience 911 service outages. Some hospitals also begin experiencing technology issues overnight, according to nurses on shift. Between 2 and 3 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration announces that all Delta and American Airlines flights are grounded. Several minutes later, the FAA says flights from United and Allegiant Airlines have been grounded regardless of their destination. Spirit Airlines says its flight reservation system has also been affected by the outage. A few hours later, between 5 and 6 a.m., public transit systems in the Northeast begin announcing that they have been impacted. Washington, DC, public transportation services \u2014 including trains and buses \u2014 begin experiencing delays, according to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. In New York City, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, North America\u2019s largest transportation network, says customer information systems have gone temporarily offline, but train and bus services remain unaffected. At 5:30 a.m., US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike tells customers that it was \u201caware of reports of crashes\u201d of its software on Microsoft Windows operating systems, according to a company advisory viewed by CNN.\u00a0CrowdStrike\u2019s cybersecurity software \u2014\u00a0used by numerous Fortune 500 companies \u2014\u00a0detects and blocks hacking threats. Between 6 and 7 a.m., the White House investigates and global banks report issues Between 6 and 7 a.m.: A White House National Security Council spokesperson tells CNN they are \u201caware of the incident and are looking into the issue and impacts.\u201d A White House source familiar with the matter tells CNN there are no indications at this time of malicious activity, though the administration is still investigating. Global banks start reporting some service disruptions, including Australia\u2019s Commonwealth Bank, South Africa\u2019s Capitec, and the Bank of Israel. Australian lenders ANZ and Westpac were also impacted, according to Downdetector, a website that tracks cyber outages. Downdetector has also reported issues for New Zealand\u2019s ASB Bank. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler issues an emergency declaration in response to the outage that affected Bureau of Emergency Communication\u2019s Computer Aided Dispatch system that is used for fielding emergency calls. The bureau begins taking calls manually, according to the mayor\u2019s office. Meanwhile, United Airlines announces that it is resuming \u201csome flights.\u201d Between 8 and 9 a.m., some flights resume but airports brace for a busy day Delta Air Lines resumes some flight departures and issues travel waivers to affected customers. A spokesperson for Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield Jackson International Airport said that systems were operational and the airport put in place additional customer service personnel to address the challenges they\u2019re facing. The spokesperson urged customers to \u201chave patience. We\u2019re trying to have grace and patience with all of the passengers. We\u2019re asking the same.\u201d Later Friday morning, Charlotte Douglas International Airport, an American Airlines hub, advises passengers to not go to the airport \u201cunless they have confirmed their flight information with the airline.\u201d Officials at Miami International Airport, another American Airlines hub, likewise warn travelers that US Customs and Border Protection operations have been affected nationwide, \u201cso international passenger arrivals are currently being processed manually at a slower pace.\u201d Between 9 a.m. and noon, federal agencies get involved and Biden is briefed A little before 9 a.m., Alaska State Troopers and Phoenix Police Department in Arizona say that service at its 911 centers are once again operational after emergency and non-emergency call centers were impacted. Portland\u2019s Computer Aided Dispatch system also comes back online at 9 a.m. \u201cAt no time was the community\u2019s ability to make 911 calls impacted,\u201d the mayor\u2019s office says in a news release. \u201cThe critical, life-saving services of public safety bureaus, including Police and Fire & Rescue, continue.\u201d The Federal Communications Commission announces it is working with federal agencies to provide assistance and determine the extent of the outage after it was made aware of \u201creports of a systems outage causing disruptions in service, including 911.\u201d President Joe Biden is briefed on the CrowdStrike outage and his team is in touch with CrowdStrike and impacted entities, says a White House official. The president\u2019s team is also engaged with agencies \u201cto get sector by sector updates throughout the day and is standing by to provide assistance as needed,\u201d according to the official. Around this time, an increasing number of federal agencies begin getting involved and reporting service disruptions. The US Department of Homeland Security says in a statement on X they are \u201cworking with CrowdStrike, Microsoft and our federal, state, local and critical infrastructure partners to fully assess and address system outages.\u201d Social Security offices close to the public, as the agency warns the public that \u201clonger wait times on our national 800 number are expected.\u201d In an internal memo viewed by CNN, the US Department of Justice says it is feeling some impact from the technology outage and, while it\u2019s working on workarounds, notes it does not have an \u201cestimated restoration time.\u201d Mail carriers UPS and FedEx tell CNN they were also impacted by the outage. UPS says its airline is operational and its drivers are on the roads, but there may be some service delays. A little after 11 a.m., CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz says in a post on X, the firm \u201c(understands) the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,\u201d adding that the incident was not a cyber attack, and that customers\u2019 data remains protected. \u201cThe issue has been identified and a fix has been deployed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was an issue with a Falcon content update for Windows Hosts.\u201d Late morning through early afternoon: canceled doctors and DMV appointments The Massachusetts Department of Transportation announces that some Registry of Motor Vehicle operations are impacted. Other states also report impacts to their driving services, including Georgia, North Carolina, Texas and Tennessee. Around the same time, several of the nation\u2019s healthcare and hospital systems announce they have been impacted by the global outage, including Mass General Brigham hospital system in Massachusetts, Penn Medicine in Pennsylvania, Northwell Health in New York, and Emory Healthcare in Atlanta. While some hospitals report delays in services, others cancel some non-urgent surgeries and medical office visits. Several cancer centers, including Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and New York\u2019s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center say they have paused certain procedures and scheduled appointments. In British Columbia, the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) announces its health system has been impacted, and is working on implementing contingency plans in order to ensure care for patients. Late afternoon sees more medical disruptions Around 4 p.m., New York Blood Center, a supplier of blood to approximately 200 hospitals in the Northeast United States, says it has put in place an emergency driving operation to distribute blood. \u201cThe test tubes are not making it onto planes from yesterday and today, requiring for us to drive them,\u201d New York Blood Center\u2019s senior vice president Andrea Cefarelli told CNN in a phone call. \u201cThere is going to be a 12-24 hour delay in getting the test results.\u201d Blood Centers of America, which rely on shipping companies like FedEx, says it is experiencing delays in reporting test results.\u00a0Executive Vice President Jenny Ficenec says blood usage may be down due to hospitals canceling elective surgeries, so the delay should not cause any shortages unless the problem persists. Blood\u00a0Assurance, which provides blood to hospitals in a number of Southeast states, including Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia, says its planned shipment of at least 20\u00a0platelets has been postponed due to flight delays and cancellations caused by the outage. \u201cWe are asking community members to help through donation,\u201d\u00a0Blood\u00a0Assurance says in an email to CNN. \u201cWe have a fantastic community of donors that always shows up when we need them.\u201d Meanwhile, CrowdStrike CEO Kurtz takes to social media again and promises customers \u201cfull transparency\u201d on how the global IT outage involving the company\u2019s software occurred. CrowdStrike would take steps \u201cto prevent anything like this from happening again,\u201d according to a statement on the company\u2019s website. Saturday morning: massive flight delays In a statement Saturday morning, Microsoft estimates the outage affected 8.5 million Windows devices. That\u2019s less 1% of all Windows machines, according to Microsoft, but the company adds that \u201cthe broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services.\u201d Various sectors are still feeling the aftershocks of the outage. Although airlines have largely resumed services, many tell customers that they expect disruptions in schedules to continue. As of noon on Saturday, at least 3,375 flights across the United States have been delayed and more than 1,200 canceled, according to data from flight tracker FlightAware. Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the nation\u2019s busiest airport, remains the most affected. Delta Air Lines has canceled more than 500 flights, while United Airlines has canceled almost 300, according to FlightAware.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/tech/timeline-crowdstrike-system-outage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_media_hunter-biden-sues-fox-news", "text": "Hunter Biden has sued Fox News and its parent corporation, accusing the right-wing network of smearing him and unlawfully publishing his explicit images without his consent in a 2022 miniseries about his legal troubles. In the lawsuit, filed Sunday in New York state court, the president\u2019s sonaccuses Fox News of unjust enrichment, intentionally inflicting emotional distress, and violating New York civil rights laws. The lawsuit makes good on\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s threat he made in April that he would take the network to court if it didn\u2019t immediately issue retractions and corrections. The miniseries, \u201cThe Trial of Hunter Biden,\u201d was a six-part offering on the Fox Nation digital streaming network, and was also promoted on Fox News, the cable TV channel. It featured a dramatized \u201cmock trial\u201d about Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas financial dealings that led in part to his federal tax indictment and that also fueled House Republicans\u2019 struggling impeachment inquiry into his father. Fox News\u00a0took down the miniseries\u00a0in late April, one day after Hunter Biden threatened to file a lawsuit. But according to the lawsuit, promotional materials for the miniseries are still on some Fox News-linked social media pages, and the miniseries episodes are still circulating \u201conline and in the public domain.\u201d A Fox News spokesperson claimed the lawsuit was meritless and \u201centirely politically motivated,\u201d and said the network looks forward to \u201cvindicating our rights in court.\u201d \u201cThe core complaint stems from a 2022 streaming program that Mr. Biden did not complain about until sending a letter in late April 2024,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe program was removed within days of the letter, in an abundance of caution, but Hunter Biden is a public figure who has been the subject of multiple investigations and is now a convicted felon. Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden\u2019s own making.\u201d The new lawsuit claims Fox News \u201ctargeted Mr. (Hunter) Biden in an effort to harass, annoy, alarm, and humiliate him, and tarnish his reputation.\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s son is seeking an unspecified amount of punitive damages, as well as any profits that Fox reaped from the miniseries, and other corrective measures. \u201cThe miniseries is fictionalized; it is not a news event. It was made for the purpose of trade and advertising, and merely exploits Mr. Biden\u2019s name, image, and likeness for Fox\u2019s commercial benefit,\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers wrote in the lawsuit. Hunter Biden\u2019s team said in the lawsuit that without his consent, Fox News \u201cunlawfully published numerous intimate images (both still and video) of Mr. Biden depicting him in the nude, depicting an unclothed or exposed intimate part of him, as well as engaged in sex acts.\u201d The right-wing network said these images originated form Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0infamous laptop\u00a0\u2013 data from which was leaked by allies for former President Donald Trump in 2020. The president\u2019s son was\u00a0convicted at a trial\u00a0last month on federal gun charges, and faces a second trial this fall on alleged tax crimes. However, he hasn\u2019t been charged in connection with the bribery and foreign lobbying allegations that were at the center of Fox\u2019s \u201cmock trial\u201d series.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/media/hunter-biden-sues-fox-news/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_21_tech_how-ai-helps-companies-set-prices", "text": "It\u2019s hard not to get fired up by how much more everything costs compared to just a few years ago. But people making the same exact purchases as you aren\u2019t necessarily paying the same exact prices as you. This became apparent to me a few weeks ago when a friend texted me that Starbucks was running a buy one, get one free drink promotion. But when I logged in to the app, the offer was nowhere to be found. Why was my friend getting special treatment? It\u2019s likely that Starbucks used artificial intelligence to determine that my friend, if offered a promotion, would make a purchase they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have, whereas I would make a purchase regardless, said Shikha Jain, a lead partner in the North American consumer and retail division at the consultancy firm Simon-Kucher. The system nailed it for me \u2014 just opening the app to check if I had the promo got me to order, and I paid full price. It\u2019s impossible to say exactly how Starbucks\u2019 systems made that correct judgment about me \u2014 though my past shopping behavior and the shopping behavior of similar customers were almost certainly factors, she said. The Seattle-based coffee chain declined to share what feeds into its AI model, dubbed Deep Brew. A spokesperson did, however, confirm that AI is powering the individualized offers it sends customers. This personalized promotion strategy is not unique to Starbucks. Companies are increasingly leveraging customer data, often derived from loyalty programs, in coordination with machine-learning models to customize prices of goods and services based on an individual\u2019s willingness to pay. The end goal: \u201cGet you to buy more items, buy the same items again or to spend more on the same items,\u201d said Jain. Traditional marketing tactics on steroids Companies are still employing tried and true marketing 101 tactics, like segmenting customers who exhibit similar purchasing behavior and preferences and taking into account, for instance, a shopper\u2019s location and the time of year. Companies have used this kind of information to effectively offer different prices to different groups of consumers. But in the past, they had to cast a pretty wide net to do so, said Jim Presley, senior vice president of US consumer analytics at NielsenIQ, a consumer insights company. That might have involved mailing coupons to homes located in a specific neighborhood or tailoring deals to people who click certain kinds of ads or read certain online publications. Companies have for years tried to target customers by distilling statistics into actual preferences. What\u2019s changed now with the advancements in AI is the level of sophistication and accuracy with which these types of predictions can be made, said Presley. Using AI, companies can now answer questions like, \u201cWhat is this person going to buy next? What do we think they\u2019re going to be willing to pay? Where are they going to buy from? When are they going to buy it?\u201d said Jain. Matt Pavich, senior director of strategy and innovation at Revionics, an AI company that specializes in helping retailers set prices, said its goal is not to tell retailers exactly how much to charge individual customers. Rather, its bread and butter is to provide companies with \u201call of the analytics and predictive scenarios\u201d to figure out prices themselves. Instead of waiting for customers to respond in real time to price changes, Revionics\u2019 clients get a toolbox to test out prices in advance. Then, by predicting how much consumers will buy at different price points, Revionics helps retailers manage their inventories. The personalization even extends beyond prices to targeting customers. So, for instance, a notification you receive informing you of a sale may be worded completely differently from a notification another customer receives of the same sale. Mary Winn Pilkington, senior vice president of investor relations and public relations at Tractor Supply Co., told CNN it recently partnered with Revionics because it wanted to more successfully adjust prices to \u201cthe ever-changing market\u201d to \u201cattract and retain customers.\u201d The aim of partnering with Revionics wasn\u2019t to see how high they can raise their prices without turning away too many customers, she said. She noted that Tractor Supply Co.\u00a0does use\u00a0machine learning \u201cto curate specific offers individualized for customers,\u201d\u00a0although\u00a0Revionics is not involved in that\u00a0aspect. This, she said, \u201coften leads to lower prices and better value on the products and services our customers need.\u201d Of course, like my Starbucks experience, it could also very well lead to identifying customers who don\u2019t require promotions at all.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/tech/how-ai-helps-companies-set-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_business_american-airlines-flight-attendants-union-new-contract", "text": "American Airlines\u2019 28,000 flight attendants have reached a tentative labor agreement with the company, their union said on Friday. The Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents the flight attendants, said the deal addresses their concerns about compensation, work rules and retroactive pay. It did not offer more details. Reached after more than three years of negotiations, the tentative agreement will be sent to the union\u2019s board for review. Once the board approves the deal, members will vote on ratifying it. \u201cIf approved, this agreement will put billions of additional dollars into compensation and work rules for our flight attendant workgroup,\u201d said union head Julie Hedrick. The White House had been closely monitoring the talks in recent months and had been concerned about the impact of a work stoppage. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and acting Labor Secretary Julie Su had earlier been involved in the talks. President Joe Biden on Friday praised the deal saying it \u201caverts a strike that would have been devastating for the industry and consumers\u201d and demonstrates \u201conce again that collective bargaining benefits workers, companies, and our economy.\u201d American said the contract will provide immediate financial and quality-of-life improvements for the employees. Last month, the airline offered flight attendants a new contract with an immediate 17% wage increase and higher profit sharing in 2024, which the union rejected. American\u2019s flight attendants had authorized their union to call a strike if there wasn\u2019t a deal.

{"id": "2024_07_01_tech_meta-eu-competition-rules", "text": "Facebook parent Meta has been accused of breaking Europe\u2019s new digital competition rules over its \u201cpay or consent\u201d advertising model. Late last year, Meta (META)\u00a0launched\u00a0a service called \u201cSubscription for no ads,\u201d allowing European users of Facebook and Instagram to pay up to \u20ac12.99 ($14) a month for ad-free versions. The alternative is to accept versions with personalized ads. The European Commission said in a statement Monday that, in its preliminary view, \u201cthis binary choice forces users to consent to the (use) of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalized but equivalent version of Meta\u2019s social networks.\u201d If the provisional findings of the Commission\u2019s investigation are confirmed, the EU could hit Meta with a fine equivalent to 10% of its global annual revenue under its landmark Digital Markets Act. Based on the company\u2019s 2023 results, that would amount to $13.5 billion. Meta said it didn\u2019t accept the Commission\u2019s findings. \u201c\u2019Subscription for no ads\u2019 follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.\u201d The EU announcement comes a week after the Commission accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the DMA by preventing app developers from freely directing consumers to cheaper services. The regulators are also investigating Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) under the new law. The DMA, which came into force in March, requires dominant online platforms \u2014 so-called gatekeepers \u2014 to give users more choice, and rivals more opportunities to compete. Online platforms often collect personal data across their own and third-party services and use it in digital advertising services. Margrethe Vestager, a European Commissioner in charge of competition policy, noted in Monday\u2019s statement that Meta had been accumulating personal data of \u201cmillions of EU citizens over many years.\u201d \u201cWe want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalized ads experience,\u201d she said. Michael Koenig, a senior official at the Commission, said Meta must offer users an alternative to \u201cfull\u201d ad personalization that \u201cdoes not rely on this personal data and which is then automatically less personalized and still available to them.\u201d \u201cThen Meta is free to keep a third option, which is a subscription not to see ads at all, or a fourth option which may have some premium features,\u201d he told journalists. The Commission is due to conclude its probe into Meta by late March next year.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_04_24_tech_nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc", "text": "Texting on the Moon? Streaming on Mars? It may not be as far away as you think. That\u2019s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets. A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year \u2014 the exact date has yet to be confirmed \u2014 carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon\u2019s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth. \u201cThe first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,\u201d Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation. The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia\u2019s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice. One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice. Images of ice \u2014 transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network \u2014 would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon. For NASA\u2019s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable. Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund \u2014 especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated. \u201cBeing able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis \u2014 as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,\u201d said Engelund. \u201cEventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.\u201d It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth\u2019s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing \ufeffspace colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth. NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy. Bell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the \u201cframework for the lunar economy.\u201d \u201cA future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,\u201d Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN. \u201cThis includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.\u201d There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too. If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth \u2014 such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms. \u201cEspecially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,\u201d Klein said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/tech/nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_investing_election-markets-your-money", "text": "Stocks are soaring this year, but that could soon change as election chaos takes the market on a rollercoaster ride. The S&P 500 is up more than 15% since January and hasn\u2019t fallen by 2% in more than 353 trading sessions. That\u2019s the longest such streak since 2007 (right before the financial collapse). But this has been a destabilizing week for US stocks and the market trajectory could be shifting. Investors have struggled to find their footing in recent days as they contend with an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, rising odds that President Joe Biden will drop out of the election, attacks on Big Tech and chipmakers from both sides of the aisle and a global computer outage affecting airports, banks, hospitals and other businesses. The Dow fell 378 points, or 0.9%, on Friday as the tech outage continued to rattle investors. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were down 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. It\u2019s the latest session to see stocks oscillating this week, reaching new highs before swinging back down again. The S&P 500 posted a new record high on Tuesday. By Thursday, the index had logged its worst two-day decline since April \u2014 when Iran launched an attack on Israel. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq had its worst day since 2022. The selloff \u201ccame amidst intense political uncertainty,\u201d wrote Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank, \u201cas speculation continues to mount that President Biden will stand down as the Democratic nominee, perhaps before Monday according to many reports, which has the potential to completely upend the dynamics of the presidential election in November.\u201d Investors crave stability, and with about 100 days left until the election, they\u2019re worried that market mayhem has set in. So what does that mean for your money? The standard advice for investors is to invest for the long term and to avoid making any short-sighted election-inspired trades. \u201cWe do not favor making meaningful portfolio changes based on who you think might win the November election,\u201d said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo. \u201cThe economy\u2019s trend seems to be a clearer signal for an investor than trying to predict the eventual market impact of any election.\u201d Still, some argue that we\u2019re in the midst of a larger market rotation. Small-sized stocks prevail For the last two years, the stock market has been tied to the Federal Reserve\u2019s actions. Inflation and interest rates have been a guiding light for markets: A higher-than-expected inflation reading or tough speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell have frequently thrown stocks into freefall. Meanwhile, any data that shows signs of a crack in the job market has sent stocks soaring as investors bet on impending rate cuts. Now, investors are parrying that central bankers will finally cut interest rates in September after first signaling a move last December. And they\u2019re celebrating. Liz Young Thomas, head of investment strategies at SoFi, said she also thinks that investors might be more certain about the election than before, as President Donald Trump has seen better polling in the days following an attempt on his life. One clear indication of that celebration is the return of small-cap stocks. Smaller companies typically outperform large caps in declining-interest-rate environments because it\u2019s cheaper for them to borrow money and grow. This makes them more attractive to investors looking for better returns. In just seven trading days, the Russell 2000 (a small-cap index) has moved nearly 10% over the last month. \u201cThe new information has been a combination of lower US Treasury yields, cooler inflation data, and increased risk appetite on the possibility of a more certain US election outcome,\u201d said Young Thomas. The earnings data helps to confirm that the move has fundamental support from the index, but likely wasn\u2019t the driving force.\u201d Tech selloff Part of the reckoning between large-cap and small-cap stocks has been due to the sudden tech selloff. As expectations increase that the Fed will begin cutting rates in the fall, investors are starting to move out of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks that fueled record highs this year. Tech stocks took an additional pummeling this week after Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the Biden administration is mulling plans to impose more sanctions on Chinese tech firms and to heighten semiconductor trade restrictions between the US and China. Former President Donald Trump, meanwhile, said in an interview with Bloomberg that Taiwan should pay for its own defense. \u201cThey did take about 100% of our chip business,\u201d Trump said. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing are down more than 12% over the past five days. On Friday, a massive global outage of Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system, caused by a faulty update from cybersecurity company \u200b\u200bCrowdStrike, furthered the tech stock rout. Shares of CrowdStrike dropped more than 11% on Friday. Shares of Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet all closed the week lower. The bright side Investors have been largely resilient this year and some financial bigwigs say the election won\u2019t change that. JPMorgan Chase CFO Jeremy Barnum said during an earnings call last week that even though the election cycle is making big news, it isn\u2019t \u201cfinancially material in the context of earnings.\u201d The current economic environment, he said, is \u201cno different than any other.\u201d As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might change slightly.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/investing/election-markets-your-money/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "business"}}
