{"id": "2024_06_23_cars_eu-china-ev-import-tariffs-talks-intl-hnk", "text": "China\u00a0and the\u00a0European Union have agreed to start talks on the planned imposition of tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) being imported into the\u00a0European market, senior officials of both sides said on Saturday. Germany\u2019s Economy Minister Robert Habeck said he had been informed by\u00a0EU\u00a0Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis that there would be concrete negotiations on tariffs with\u00a0China. The confirmation came after\u00a0China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said its head Wang Wentao, and Dombrovskis, executive vice president of the\u00a0European Commission, had agreed to start consultations over the\u00a0EU\u2019s anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs. \u201cThis is new and surprising in that it has not been possible to enter into a concrete negotiation timetable in the last few weeks,\u201d Habeck said in Shanghai. He said it was a first step and many more will be necessary. \u201cWe are far from the end, but at least, it is a first step that was not possible before.\u201d The minister had said earlier on Saturday that the\u00a0European Union\u2019s door was open for discussions regarding\u00a0EU\u00a0tariffs\u00a0on Chinese exports. \u201cWhat I suggested to my Chinese partners today is that the doors are open for discussions and I hope that this message was heard,\u201d he said in his first statement in Shanghai, after meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing. Habeck\u2019s visit is the first by a senior\u00a0European official since Brussels proposed hefty duties on imports of Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) to combat what the\u00a0EU\u00a0considers excessive subsidies. Habeck said there is time for a dialog between the\u00a0EU\u00a0and\u00a0China\u00a0on tariff issues before the duties come into full effect in November and that he believes in open markets but that markets require a level playing field. Proven subsidies that are intended to increase the export advantages of companies can\u2019t be accepted, the minister said. Another point of tension between Beijing and Berlin is\u00a0China\u2019s support for Russia in its war in Ukraine. Habeck noted Chinese trade with Russia increased more than 40% last year. Habeck said he had told Chinese officials that this was taking a toll on their economic relationship. \u201cCircumventions of the sanctions imposed on Russia are not acceptable,\u201d he said, adding that technical goods produced in\u00a0Europe should not end up on the battlefield via other countries. Not a \u2018punishment\u2019 The\u00a0EU\u2019s provisional duties of up to 38.1% on imported Chinese EVs are set to apply by July 4, with the investigation set to continue until November 2, when definitive duties, typically for five years, could be imposed. \u201cThis opens a phase where negotiations are possible, discussions are important and dialog is needed,\u201d Habeck said. Proposed\u00a0EU\u00a0tariffs on Chinese goods are not a \u201cpunishment,\u201d Habeck told Chinese officials earlier in Beijing. \u201cIt is important to understand that these are not punitive tariffs,\u201d he said in the first plenary session of a climate and transformation dialog. Countries such as the United States, Brazil and Turkey had used punitive tariffs, but not the\u00a0EU, he said. \u201cEurope does things differently.\u201d Habeck said the\u00a0European Commission had for nine months examined in detail whether Chinese companies had benefited unfairly from subsidies. Any countervailing duty measure that results from the\u00a0EU\u00a0review \u201cis not a punishment,\u201d he said, adding that such measures were meant to compensate for the advantages granted to Chinese companies by Beijing. Zheng Shanjie, chairman of\u00a0China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission, responded: \u201cWe will do everything to protect Chinese companies.\u201d Proposed\u00a0EU\u00a0duties on Chinese-made EVs would hurt both sides, Zheng added. He told Habeck he hoped Germany would demonstrate leadership within the\u00a0EU\u00a0and \u201cdo the correct thing.\u201d He also denied accusations of unfair subsidies, saying the development of\u00a0China\u2019s new energy industry was the result of comprehensive advantages in technology, market and industry supply chains, fostered in fierce competition. The industry\u2019s growth \u201cis the result of competition, rather than subsidies, let alone unfair competition,\u201d Zheng said during the meeting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/cars/eu-china-ev-import-tariffs-talks-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_24_business_boeing-doj-criminal-faa-737-max", "text": "Prosecutors are urging the US Justice Department to file criminal charges against Boeing for safety issues surrounding its 737 Max, although top Justice Department officials haven\u2019t made a final decision, a source familiar with the development tells CNN. The possible criminal charges are just the latest severe blow to the reputation of Boeing, a company once known for the quality and safety of its commercial jets. Beyond two fatal crashes of the 737 Max in 2018 and 2019, the company has faced a series of questions about the safety and quality of its jets. In January, a door plug on a 737 Max flown by Alaska Air blew out early in a flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet, further damaging Boeing\u2019s reputation. The Justice Department and Boeing had reached an agreement in January of 2021 to settle charges that alleged the company defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the certification process of the 737 Max before it could carry its first passengers. The plane started service in 2017, but suffered two fatal crashes \u2013 in October 2018 and March of 2019 \u2013 which led to a 20-month grounding of the jet. The cause of the crashes proved to be a design flaw, Boeing has admitted. The 2021 settlement would have spared Boeing any criminal liability despite the Justice Department\u2019s statement at that time that \u201cmisleading statements, half-truths, and omissions communicated by Boeing employees to the FAA\u201d had hidden potential problems with the the design flaw. Reuters first reported the charging recommendation. Boeing declined to comment on that report earlier Monday, nor did it have any comment when reached again Monday evening. Boeing has told prosecutors that it will contest claims that it violated the 2021 deal. Some family members of the crash victims and members of Congress harshly criticized the 2021 deal, known as a deferred prosecution agreement, which spared Boeing from criminal charges at that time. And this month a group of those family members wrote a letter to the Justice Department urging Boeing be hit with the maximum possible $24.9 billion fine. The letter they wrote to the Justice department called Boeing\u2019s actions \u201cthe deadliest corporate crime in U.S. history.\u201d Boeing had just over $6.9 billion cash on hand as of its last quarterly earnings statement in late March. The 2021 deferred prosecution agreement was due to expire this past January, freeing Boeing from the risk of criminal liability. But just days before that deadline expired, the Alaska Air incident happened. The charges against Boeing don\u2019t mean any Boeing executive will face charges as an individual. But it could add to the company\u2019s deep financial problems. It has posted core operating losses of $31.9 billion since the start of the 20-month grounding of the 737 Max that followed its second fatal crash in 2019. The company is at risk of losing its investment grade credit rating for the first time in its history. If its debt falls into junk bond status, its cost of borrowing money that it needs to cover losses will soar. At its most extreme, Boeing could be found ineligible to do business with the federal government if found guilty of a crime. That would be an virtual death sentence for Boeing, which gets 37% of its revenue in 2023 from US government contracts. But such a penalty is highly unlikely for reasons of national security, since most of those contracts are with the Department of Defense. But if the company faces criminal charges, a new settlement is the most likely outcome. And such a settlement would likely include some manner of additional oversight of the company\u2019s operations, perhaps in the form of a federal monitor, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace and defense management consultant.

{"id": "2024_06_24_business_apple-eu-competition-rules", "text": "European Union regulators have accused Apple of breaking tough new digital competition rules by preventing app developers from freely directing consumers to cheaper services. The European Commission\u2019s preliminary findings stem from an investigation opened in March. If found guilty, the company could face a fine of up to 10% of its $383 billion annual global revenue, the EU\u2019s executive arm said in a statement Monday. The fine can be increased to 20% of the company\u2019s global revenue if it repeats the offense, it added. Monday\u2019s action marks the first time the Commission has accused a company of breaching its landmark Digital Markets Act. The DMA, which came into force in March, is a sweeping set of\u00a0competition rules aimed at curbing the power of Big Tech. That month, the Commission announced that it had launched investigations into Apple (AAPL), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook parent Meta (META) on suspicion they were failing to comply with the DMA. The three companies have been designated as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d by the Commission \u2014\u00a0Big Tech firms crucial to interactions between businesses and consumers through their links to \u201ccore platform services,\u201d such as digital marketplaces and app stores. The Commission must reach the final decision on whether Apple has failed to comply with the DMA within one year from the opening of its investigation on March 25. Apple said in a statement Monday that, over the past few months, it had \u201cmade a number of changes to comply with the DMA in response to feedback from developers and the European Commission. We are confident our plan complies with the law.\u201d More scrutiny The Commission has provisionally found that, according to the rules of Apple\u2019s app store, \u201cdevelopers cannot provide pricing information within the app\u201d or communicate \u201cin any other way\u201d with their customers to steer them toward offers available on alternative platforms. Apple allows so-called \u201csteering\u201d by developers only through links in their apps that redirect customers to a web page, the Commission said. But that \u201clink-out process is subject to several restrictions,\u201d it added. \u201cToday is a very important day for the effective enforcement of the DMA,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the EU\u2019s competition and digital chief, said in Monday\u2019s statement. \u201cSteering is key to ensure that app developers are less dependent on gatekeepers\u2019 app stores and for consumers to be aware of better offers.\u201d Apple said in its statement: \u201cAll developers doing business in the EU on the App Store have the opportunity to utilize the capabilities that we have introduced, including the ability to direct app users to the web to complete purchases at a very competitive rate. As we have done routinely, we will continue to listen and engage with the European Commission.\u201d The Commission also said it had opened another investigation, into whether Apple\u2019s new contractual requirements for app developers breach the DMA. These requirements include a \u201ccore technology fee,\u201d which charges developers of third-party apps \u20ac0.50 ($0.54) each time their app is installed. The Commission\u2019s initial findings against Apple come only months after it fined the company \u20ac1.84 billion ($1.97 billion) for preventing rival music streaming services such as Spotify from telling iPhone users that they could find cheaper ways to subscribe outside of Apple\u2019s app store. It was the bloc\u2019s first-ever antitrust penalty on the US tech giant. Apple said in a statement at the time that app developers \u201ccompete on a level playing field\u201d on its app store and that it planned to appeal the fine. In January, Apple announced\u00a0changes\u00a0to its handling of apps in the EU in anticipation of the DMA coming into effect. That included plans to allow third-party app stores on iPhones and iPads for the first time\u00a0in\u00a0the company\u2019s history\u00a0and significant cuts to its app store fees.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_tech_airbnb-whistleblower-complaint-dangerous-organizations-team", "text": "Airbnb has undermined users\u2019 safety by scaling back its work to remove extremists from its platform, a former contractor alleged in a new whistleblower complaint. Jess Hernandez worked full-time as an investigations analyst for Airbnb\u2019s dangerous organizations team from May 2022 to November 2023, researching extremist networks as part of the company\u2019s work to keep dangerous individuals off the platform. But she says she was terminated in November 2023, shortly after her team was directed by management to reinstate users who had been removed for their participation in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. \u201cAirbnb spent much of 2023 scaling back and undermining the work of its team tasked with removing individuals affiliated with dangerous and extremist organizations from the platform,\u201d Whistleblower Aid, the organization representing Hernandez, said in a statement. It added that by making the changes, \u201cAirbnb privately abandoned its public commitment to its hosts\u2019 and guests\u2019 safety and security under this policy.\u201d Hernandez filed the whistleblower disclosure in May to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Trade Commission. The complaint was first reported Wednesday by NBC News. CNN has not viewed the complaint and could not independently verify the details included in the NBC News report. Airbnb disputed Hernandez\u2019s claims, saying that it continues to enforce against members of dangerous or extremist organizations. \u201cContrary to these baseless and inaccurate allegations, we have actually expanded the remit of our team\u00a0to detect and remove users who pose safety risk\u00a0and this year we\u2019ve hired additional team members to support the enforcement of this policy,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cAs an online platform that\u00a0facilitates millions of real-world interactions globally,\u00a0we have robust policies, processes, and teams across the company focusing on promoting community safety, including preventing unsafe users from using the platform.\u201d Airbnb touts more than 5 million hosts who list space on the room- and home-rental platform. In the first three months of 2024 alone, Airbnb facilitated the booking of more than 132 million nights and \u201cexperiences,\u201d non-overnight offerings such as walking tours. The whistleblower complaint comes as Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky has for years tried to quell safety concerns over a business that is, at its heart, strangers staying in the homes of other strangers. Those efforts have included crackdowns on parties, resources for solo female travelers and a ban on indoor security cameras. Airbnb in 2016 asked members to sign a commitment that they would \u201caccept people regardless of their race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or age\u201d in order to host or make a booking on the platform. And in the following years, it pointed to that pledge when removing users associated with extremist organizations. In 2017, the company removed some accounts and canceled bookings associated with the Unite the Right White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. And in 2021, months after the January 6 attack, Airbnb said it had removed \u201cnumerous individuals\u201d who had been identified as having \u201cparticipated in the violent criminal activity at the US Capitol.\u201d It added that it had canceled reservations in the Washington DC metro area during inauguration week in response to calls from local and federal officials. But in 2023, Airbnb came under fire by conservative media for removing the parents of far-right activist Lauren Southern from the platform; the company quickly reversed the removal, calling it a \u201cmistake.\u201d Southern, a far-right Canadian YouTube personality, had criticized her parents\u2019 removal from the platform on social media and later in an appearance on Fox News. Around the same time, Hernandez claims that Airbnb made the dangerous organizations team\u2019s work slower and more complicated, requiring proposed removals to be reviewed by legal, communications and community policy departments leaders, according to NBC, which said it received Hernandez\u2019s 161-page complaint from an anonymous source on Capitol Hill. \u201cOur hands were tied \u2014 we weren\u2019t removing people,\u201d Hernandez told NBC. Prior to her work at Airbnb, Hernandez worked as a researcher for the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium, an organization that tracks terrorist and hate groups, according to Whistleblower Aid.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/tech/airbnb-whistleblower-complaint-dangerous-organizations-team/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_business_malls-lack-windows-curious-consumer", "text": "Decades ago, Americans flocked to Main Street to shop. A string of small family-owned stores stood next to each other along a tree-lined block or two, displaying their goods through large welcoming windows. Then in 1956 something happened that forever changed that shopping experience. A new retailing format packed up the hustle and bustle of Main Street commerce and recreated it inside of a very large boxy building that was \u2013 deliberately \u2013 devoid of windows. The birth of the American mall ushered in an era of \u201cwindowless\u201d shopping that\u2019s largely still here. The strategy was clever and little details in the planning \u2013- from the no-frills shoebox architecture to potted plants \u2013 were carefully thought out. These were cost-saving measures for mall operators that were also designed to influence mallgoers to spend freely. The unnaturally bright artificial lighting strived to create a perpetual daytime environment. This way, mall visitors would stay longer than they had expected to and spent more than they would have wanted to. Another reason for malls shunning windows did have something to do with the merchandising, Burt Flickinger, retail expert and managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group told CNN. Fewer windows and more walls, he said, meant more space for retailers to add shelves and rods to stock their products and maximize sales per square foot in their stores that would otherwise be lost to a dull view of a mall parking lot. But the sneakiest reason why malls limit windows could be to make shoppers lose track of time. \u201cShoppers can\u2019t see the rain storm or snow storm blowing in without windows. Windowless shopping creates an environment of consumption without distractions,\u201d Flickinger said. \u201cWhen people have a sense of timelessness and comfort, families spend more because they can focus just on the stores and the mall experience.\u201d Shock-and-awe on the inside The first fully enclosed mall \u2013 the Southdale Center in Minneapolis \u2013 opened in 1956. It became the prototype going forward as indoor climate-controlled malls that could stay open year-round popped up in suburbs across the country. The architect of the 1.2 million square feet Southdale Center was Austria-born Victor Gruen, considered the pioneer of modern mall design. He established Gruen Associates, a legacy architecture, planning and landscape firm still in existence and based in Los Angeles. He wanted to wow shoppers with shock-and-awe once they entered the building and took in the brightly-lit shops and cafes, even artwork exhibited around the mall. At the center of the mall layout would be a fountain or a skylight, possibly the only entry point to natural light coming into the expansive space. He added plants and music to create an inviting sensory experience. The structure of the traditional mall was either a T-shape, or a cross shape with the four anchor stores on either sides, Stephanie Cegielski, vice president of research with the International Council of Shopping Centers, told CNN. \u201cWhen you are walking around that \u2018T\u2019 everything is facing into you. As a shopper, you are perpetually looking at what is coming next and opposed to what\u2019s going on in the outside world,\u201d she said. Because all of the activity faced in, Cegielski said it didn\u2019t make sense for there to be windows per se, \u201cunless you were looking at a department store that has its own separate entrance into the mall that would create that window to the outside,\u201d she said. The exterior look was another story. The Southdale mall was functional and drab to look at and that is the blueprint that all traditional enclosed malls have continued to follow. \u201cMalls are really built to have the landscape on the inside. All of the architectural energy that we normally see on the outside of a building in an urban setting is focused internally. A mall is a machine for selling,\u201d Alexandra Lange, an architecture critic and author of \u201cMeet me by the fountain: An inside history of the mall\u201d said in an interview with CNN. The first round of malls in the mid-to-late 1950s did have more architecture on the outside, Lange said. \u201cBut the mall owners found that there was no increase in consumer interest based on that so let\u2019s  not waste money on that,\u201d she said. Fewer windows means lower energy bill As an added bonus, \u201cit was a lot less expensive for mall developers to not put multiple windows facing on the outside because it would make it cheaper to heat and cool the big-box space,\u201d said Thomas McMillan, director with the Center of Retailing Studies at Texas A&M University\u2019s Mays Business School, in an interview with CNN. Energy costs typically are the second-highest operating expense for retailers after labor costs. \u201cThe sophistication of double-pane energy-efficient windows wasn\u2019t ubiquitous when a lot of the malls were built in America during and after the 1970s energy crisis. So air conditioning could seep through the window panes,\u201d said Flickinger. The mall design inspired another type of store. Other shopping destinations that incorporate a windowless boxy venue are supermarkets. \u201cA typical grocery store layout has all of the fresh food around the outside that tends to be refrigerated. It\u2019s good for it to be next to a wall where there is power,\u201d Lange said. \u201cIf you cut windows into the wall, you have less space for refrigerated cases.\u201d Today, there are about 1,122 enclosed malls in the US, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. That\u2019s down from around 1,400 regional malls that existed around 15 years ago, according to Kristin Mueller, president, retail property management with\u00a0JLL, a real estate and investment management services firm, in an interview with CNN. But even with fewer enclosed malls in existence today, and just a handful of new malls built over the last decade (including the 3 million square foot American Dream Mall which opened in East Rutherford, New Jersey in 2019) that still abide by Gruen\u2019s blueprint, shoppers, especially Gen Z and Millennials, don\u2019t appear to be put off by their windowless aesthetic, she said. On average, 54% of US adult shoppers have visited a mall at least once a month in 2023 and spent an average of a little more than $300 each month last year, according to the latest data from the ICSC. As many as 70% of those shoppers were GenZers and 66% of them Millennials, according to the group. Mall retailing is evolving, however, said Cegielski. Families head to malls for entertainment as much as shopping, with people enjoying restaurants, movies, mini golf, pickleball courts and large indoor amusement centers that have been retrofitted inside of existing shopping centers. Some of these adaptive uses of traditional malls might be creating a practical need for windows after all, she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/business/malls-lack-windows-curious-consumer/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_23_tech_apple-ringtone-by-the-seaside-alarm", "text": "One morning at 6 am, Gyaltsen Moktan woke in a panic. It was 2019. He worked at an all-you-can-eat sushi buffet and was responsible for opening the restaurant each morning. So he set a wakeup call on his iPhone. Then Apple\u2019s \u201cBy the Seaside\u201d alarm sound went off. Moktan chose the jaunty, cheerful tune available as a ringtone and alarm on many of Apple\u2019s devices, thinking that the song\u2019s easygoing melody would make waking up a peaceful experience. That bet soured. \u201cThe alarm is mocking you in a way. It\u2019s kind of like a horror movie, where they do the nursery rhyme before doom,\u201d said Moktan, now an English teacher in Tokyo, Japan. \u201cBy the Seaside\u201d is perhaps Apple\u2019s most polarizing alarm and ringtone, evoking comparisons to nails on a chalkboard, the word \u201cmoist\u201d and screaming children on a plane. In the past, phones had only one sound: the shrill, continuous ring of a landline. With so many ringtones now available, though, the sounds say more about how people express themselves \u2014 and what can cause stress and anxiety. You probably think you don\u2019t know \u201cBy the Seaside,\u201d but you do. On YouTube, there are extended versions, rap versions, versions played on various instruments. \u201cSome people think it\u2019s a great ringtone. And other people say, Oh, my God, it\u2019s terrible,\u201d said Carlos Xavier Rodriguez, chair of music theory at the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance, of the divisive tune. \u201cYou love it or you hate it.\u201d From knocker-uppers to chirping birds People have been trying to use sound to wake up reliably for centuries, relying on everything from church bells to roosters. Some people used to employ the services of knocker-uppers, or workers paid to wake customers by tapping on the door or window with a stick, until the 1970s in some parts of Britain. The first known alarm clock in the United States was invented by clockmaker Levi Hutchins of Concord, New Hampshire in 1787, but his clock rang just once at 4 am. In 1874, French inventor Antoine Redier patented an adjustable mechanical alarm clock. Seth Thomas patented a mechanical wind-up one a couple years later, and the electric alarm clock was invented by the end of the 19th century. (Its inventors probably didn\u2019t expect the iPhone.) Alarm clocks have evolved further since then. Some high-tech ones these days are designed to emit light mimicking sunrise, waking users gently with a soft glow and relaxing sounds such as birds twittering or the lilt of a flute. What is wrong with this song? Boston Flake, a 15-year old Utah high school student, says that \u201cBy the Seaside\u201d is the only alarm that can wake him up every morning for school. Far from a morning person, he has tried creating alarms himself that are mash-ups of songs, blaring sirens, horns and booming bass lines, to no avail. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a love-hate relationship,\u201d said Flake. \u201cSometimes I\u2019ll hear it in my dreams, and I\u2019ll get a little jolt and start freaking out.\u201d Apple did not respond to requests for comment. There are musical elements to \u201cBy the Seaside\u201d that make it difficult to listen to, says Rodriguez. There\u2019s no discernible key. The song doesn\u2019t end on a downbeat, so there\u2019s no feeling of resolution when it briefly pauses before repeating. But a bigger factor of users\u2019 emotional responses is the \u201cuncanny valley\u201d element to the tune, says Rodriguez. The uncanny valley phenomenon is the uneasy feeling people have towards life-like, but not quite human things such as robots, dolls or even clowns. \u201cBy the Seaside\u201d has an electronic, cheesy sound of a Casio keyboard that is reminiscent of computerized music eerily devoid of human touch, Rodrigo said. The alarm sound\u2019s critics are vocal with their displeasure: \u201cif ur alarm is \u2018by the seaside\u2019 you are one unserious\u201d person, says one viral post on X, using a somewhat spicier word than \u201cperson.\u201d It has received 160,000 likes and more than 15,000 reposts, with many users weighing in with their own thoughts. Some claim that the tune sends them into a \u201cflight or fight\u201d response. Others say the tune gives them heart palpitations and that it fills them with dread. So controversial is the nautical jingle that it\u2019s even spawned internet lore. Rumors have circulated on social media that pop singer Adele wrote the tune and that it has made her more money than her entire discography combined. Ryan Meadows, the creator of Fake Showbiz News, confirmed to CNN that he started that rumor. \u201cWe like to think [Adele would] find the joke funny. Perhaps it might even inspire her to compose a suite [of] ringtones for the iPhones of the future!\u201d Meadows, who goes by a pseudonym, wrote in an email to CNN. Representatives for Adele did not respond to requests for comment. To be sure, the tune has its supporters. Krystal Roxas, a biopharmaceuticals quality systems specialist in San Bruno, California, used to wake up to the default \u201cRadar\u201d alarm. She switched to \u201cBy the Seaside\u201d in 2018 after moving in with her boyfriend, who complained that her then-alarm sound made him anxious in the morning. She has been a faithful listener since. \u201cI love \u2018By the Seaside.\u2019 I don\u2019t know why people hate on it,\u201d said Roxas, 34. \u201cI actually let it play out until it\u2019s done. I do a little dance in bed.\u201d Moktan, 26, concedes that he believes users\u2019 hate for the alarm might stem from the fact that people just end up hating whatever wakes them up. He once tried to set Bill Withers and Grover Washington, Jr\u2019s \u201cJust the Two of Us\u201d as his alarm, before changing it because he began disliking the song, he says. \u201cI have yet to find an alarm I like,\u201d Moktan said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/tech/apple-ringtone-by-the-seaside-alarm/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

The Recording Industry Association of America \u2013 the trade group on behalf of labels including Sony Music Entertainment, UMG Recordings and Warner Records \u2013 filed two copyright infringement cases against AI companies Suno and Uncharted Labs, the developer behind Udio, for training their AI models with the labels\u2019 unlicensed sound recordings. Udio is the company behind \u201cBBL Drizzy,\u201d the AI-generated song that went viral last month during the Kendrick Lamar and Drake spat. Udio was founded last year by former Google DeepMind researchers to make it \u201ceasy for anyone to create emotionally resonant music in an instant,\u201d according to the company. In April, it raised $10 million in funding. Meanwhile, Suno raised $125 million in funding last month. The platform, which allows users to create songs with only a few prompts, relies on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT for lyrics and title development. Udio and Suno did not immediately respond to a request for comment. RIAA CEO Mitch Glazier said in a statement that the lawsuits are \u201cnecessary to reinforce the most basic rules of the road for the responsible, ethical, and lawful development of generative AI systems and to bring Suno\u2019s and Udio\u2019s blatant infringement to an end.\u201d He added that the music community is already partnering and collaborating with \u201cresponsible developers to build sustainable AI tools\u201d that put artists and songwriters in charge, but unlicensed services can exploit an artist\u2019s work \u201cwithout consent or pay set back \u2026 .\u201d In April, more than 200 artists, including Billie Eilish, Kacey Musgraves, J Balvin, Ja Rule, Jon Bon Jovi, The Jonas Brothers, Katy Perry, Miranda Lambert and more, signed an open letter\u00a0organized by the non-profit Artist Rights Alliance calling on AI developers, technology companies, platforms and digital music services to \u201ccease the use of artificial intelligence to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists.\u201d The lawsuit against Udio states \u201cif developed with the permission and participation of copyright owners, generative AI tools will be able to assist humans in creating and producing new and innovative music.\u201d It added: \u201cBut if developed irresponsibly, without regard for fundamental copyright protections, those same tools threaten enduring and irreparable harm to recording artists, record labels, and the music industry, inevitably reducing the quality of new music available to consumers and diminishing our shared culture.\u201d Meanwhile, the lawsuit against Suno states the company has over 10,000,000 users generating music files using the platform, bringing in about 2,000,000 streams. \u201cThese digital music files have been released to the public\u2014some already finding their way onto the major streaming services\u2014and compete with the copyrighted sound recordings that enabled their creation; yet Suno sought no permission from and gives no credit or compensation to the human artists or other rightsholders whose works fueled their creation.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context and developments.

{"id": "2024_06_21_business_teamsters-president-speaking-republican-convention-trump", "text": "Teamsters President Sean O\u2019Brien will speak to the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July, a sign that former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is hoping to peel off the support of union members from President Joe Biden. But unlike other speakers at the RNC, O\u2019Brien\u2019s appearance does not represent an endorsement of Trump, according to Teamsters union spokesperson Kara Deniz. O\u2019Brien has requested the opportunity to also speak at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August. The DNC has yet to accept that request, Deniz said. Trump posted the announcement Friday afternoon on his Truth Social platform. \u201cOur GREAT convention will unify Americans and demonstrate to the nation\u2019s working families they come first,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWhen I am back in the White House, the hardworking Teamsters, and all working Americans, will once again have a country they can afford to live in and be respected around the world. Sean, I look forward to seeing you represent the Teamsters in Milwaukee. Together we can Make America Great Again.\u201d Deniz said in an email that the union was happy Trump extended the invitation. \u201cThis is truly unprecedented since it will be the very first time a Teamsters General President has addressed the RNC,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cOur 1.3 million members\u00a0represent every political background, and their message needs to be heard by as wide an audience as possible, and that includes all political candidates running for elected office. We appreciate former President Trump\u2019s openness to inviting a labor leader to speak on behalf of working families.\u201d \u201cWe sincerely hope the DNC will also respond to our request with an invitation,\u201d she said. Trump and O\u2019Brien met at the former president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in early January. Trump then met with the union\u2019s leadership on January 31. Some other union leaders objected to the meetings, with John Palmer \u2014 the group\u2019s international vice president at-large \u2014 writing a letter at that time denouncing Trump as \u201ca known union buster, scab, and insurrectionist.\u201d \u201cWe should never entertain dialogue with a candidate with such an anti-union record,\u201d he wrote. Biden has a very pro-union record. He became the first sitting president to appear on the picket line to support strikers during the United Auto Workers union\u2019s strike against the nation\u2019s three unionized automakers. He has regularly voiced support for unions and has appointed a very pro-union leadership to the National Labor Relations Board, which has been much friendlier to union positions during his administration. He also met with the Teamsters leadership in March. But so far, the Teamsters have endorsed neither candidate, unlike the AFL-CIO and many powerful unions, such as the UAW and the National Education Association. And the union\u2019s political arm gave similar size donations of hundreds of thousands of dollars to committees of both the Democratic and Republican parties earlier this year. O\u2019Brien has had his own harsh criticism of some other Republicans, if not Trump. At a Senate hearing in November, he and Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican from Oklahoma, both said they were prepared to engage in a fist fight in the middle of a hearing until Sen. Bernie Sanders, the committee chair, ordered them to stop. The DNC said it has yet to settle on its set of speakers for its convention in August. \u201cWe are building a convention in Chicago that will tell our story to the American people, including the stories of labor and union leaders and workers that President Biden has been delivering\u00a0for as the most pro-union president in modern history,\u201d said DNC spokesperson Matt Hill. \u2013 CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg and Kristen Holmes contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/business/teamsters-president-speaking-republican-convention-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said.

But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

Apple is the third most valuable company in the US with a $3.27 trillion market cap. Nvidia shares closed 3.5% higher on Tuesday. Microsoft shares fell 0.5% and Apple shares lost 1.1%. Nvidia earlier this month joined the tech giants in becoming the only US companies to cross a $3 trillion market cap. The chipmaker\u2019s stock has been on a tear for the last year and a half. Nvidia\u2019s chips are unmatched in producing processors that power artificial intelligence systems, including for generative AI, the technology backing OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT that can create text, images and other media.

{"id": "2024_06_21_tech_apple-ai-chatgpt-ban-china", "text": "Apple is banking on its upcoming AI features to boost iPhone sales especially in China, where demand has been lagging. But there\u2019s a problem: ChatGPT \u2014 soon to be integrated into Siri \u2014 is banned in China. In a presentation earlier this month, Apple (AAPL) showed off its proprietary technology called Apple Intelligence to power compelling new AI features and announced a partnership with OpenAI to also use its viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity. (When Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry, ChatGPT can step in.) The move signaled how Apple is trying to expedite the latest buzzy technology at a time when tech rivals, such as Microsoft, Google, Meta and Samsung, have already found their AI footing. A deal with OpenAI could help Apple close the gap. But China is one of the first countries in the world to regulate the generative AI technology that powers these popular services. In August, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s top internet watchdog, rolled out new guidelines for the industry, requiring companies to seek approval before deployment. The organization has approved more than 100 AI models as of March, all from Chinese companies. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal Thursday, Apple is looking for a Chinese AI company to partner with ahead of the iPhone\u2019s expected September launch, but it hasn\u2019t reached a deal yet. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The need to find a partner \u2014 and quickly \u2014 comes at a time when Apple\u2019s smartphone sales tumbled a stunning 10% in the first quarter of this year, according to market research firm IDC, due largely to iPhone sales sharply dropping in China. The company has lost momentum in China as nationalism, a rough economy and increased competition have also hurt sales. China is the company\u2019s second-largest market. Trouble in the EU Limitations on its new AI tools may not be specific to China. In a statement sent to CNN following the publication of this article, Apple said it \u201chighly motivated\u201d to bring the features to customers around the world, but it is facing regulatory challenges in the European Union, as well. The company said it doesn\u2019t believe it will be able to roll out its AI features in Europe this year. \u201cDue to the regulatory uncertainties brought about by the Digital Markets Act (DMA), we do not believe that we will be able to roll out three of these features\u2014iPhone Mirroring, SharePlay Screen Sharing enhancements, and Apple Intelligence\u2014to our EU users this year,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cSpecifically, we are concerned that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security,\u201d it added. \u201cWe are committed to collaborating with the European Commission in an attempt to find a solution that would enable us to deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety.\u201d Resurgent competitors In China, concerns around iPhone sales continue to mount as Chinese smartphone brand Huawei\u2019s smartphone sales growth was 70% in the first quarter, according to Counterpoint Research. If a solution is not worked out by fall, Chinese consumers may feel short changed and choose to wait until they can get the full AI experience with Apple, she added. \u201cApple is very likely to seek a local partner in China in place of OpenAI, because simply put, it needs to,\u201d said Nabila Popal, a senior director at IDC Research. \u201cChinese consumers are expecting\u00a0their premium phones to have the latest AI functionality and may\u00a0hesitate to spend over $1000 for devices that don\u2019t have all the AI bells and whistles.\u201d \u201cThe real growth in China for Apple will come in the long term, as Apple Intelligence evolves offering more use cases, extends language support beyond English and when Siri can leverage other local AI models to provide the ChatGPT-like function,\u201d Popal said. In the meantime, some AI companies in China may be better suited to target its consumers anyway, such as by offering more local dialects than what\u2019s currently found in foreign AI models, Reece Hayden, an analyst at ABI Research, noted. Apple wouldn\u2019t be the first foreign company to work with the Cyberspace Administration of China for AI and smartphones. In January, Samsung teamed up with Chinese tech giant Baidu (BIDU) to use its AI model to help power its translation service. It works with another AI firm Meitu for photo editing tools. In other parts of the world, Samsung uses its own propriety AI technology, along with Google\u2019s (GOOGL) AI model Gemini, which is also banned in China. Samsung, however, accounts for less than 1% of the total market in China, according to Counterpoint Research. Although the clock is ticking for Apple to secure a partnership ahead of its fall software launch, Jeff Fieldhack, a research director at Counterpoint, believes it will be able to ink a deal in time. \u201cApple should be able to have a partnership aligned very quickly because it has such a strong global install base, and it would be a gem for these companies to work with them,\u201d he said, noting that they\u2019d soon be established as an an AI power player in the country.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/tech/apple-ai-chatgpt-ban-china/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_business_alaska-airlines-labor-deal-flight-attendants", "text": "Alaska Airlines and its 7,000-member flight attendants union reached a tentative labor deal late Friday, concluding talks that lasted more than a year and a half. Terms of the deal have not been released, though the union called it a \u201crecord contract.\u201d The deal likely contains a significant pay raise, which has been a common demand across the airline industry and sought by unions whose members in some cases have not seen a pay increase in years. In April, the union announced to members it was seeking pay raises of between 43% to 56%, depending upon seniority, through 2026. Those pay raises would include back pay covering a period dating back a year and a half that they\u2019ve worked under the terms of the previous contract. \u201cYour actions over the last two years of bargaining \u2026 ensured we had the leverage to extract every last dollar from Alaska Airlines management,\u201d the union said Friday in a statement to its members. Alaska Airlines said it was pleased to have reached an agreement and thanked union negotiators. \u201cWith our combined efforts, we\u2019ve been able to reach an agreement that provides quality of life and continued career growth at Alaska,\u201d the airline said in a statement. The agreement still needs the approval of union leadership and rank-and-file members to go into effect. In February, rank-and-file members voted 99.5% in favor of authorizing a strike. However, under the Railway Labor Act, the labor law that covers airline workers, its members could not go on strike, even though their contract had reached its scheduled end date in December 2022. Instead, the union members continued to work under the terms and pay dictated by that contract. Such restrictions on striking don\u2019t exist for most private sector employees. In February, flight attendants from Alaska \u2014 along with American, United and Southwest \u2014held unprecedented coordinated pickets demanding new contracts. Since then, flight attendants at Southwest reached a deal that included an immediate 22.3% raise as of May 1 and $364 million in retroactive wages. Meanwhile, flight attendants at American and United are still seeking new deals. American flight attendants have asked to be released from restrictions so they can go on strike, but even if that is granted there would be months of cooling off periods before they could walk out, under the Railway Labor Act. Steve Maller, a flight attendant for nearly 20 years, was among those on the picket lines in February. Maller was one of the flight attendants on the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282, which drew international attention on January 5 when a door plug blew off, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Maller told CNN in February that he and the other members of the flight crew were commended by Alaska Airlines\u2019 top management for their actions in the plane, which landed without serious injuries. But he said he picketed because the existing contract did not provide a livable wage for too many flight attendants. Maller said he has worked at times as a bartender and that most flight attendants he knows also have second jobs. \u201cYou have to have something to have livable pay, to make ends meet,\u201d he said. Maller said he\u2019s also worried the airline is losing too many veteran flight attendants who have gone years with little or now wage increase. \u201cIt was unheard of five years ago (for flight attendants to) quit their jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have 20, 25, 30 a month (quitting).\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/business/alaska-airlines-labor-deal-flight-attendants/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

Here\u2019s what the CDK Global outage means for both car sellers and shoppers. What exactly happened? On Wednesday, CDK spokesperson Lisa Finney told CNN that the company was investigating a cyber incident. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution and concern for our customers, we have shut down most of our systems and are working diligently to get everything up and running as quickly as possible,\u201d Finney said in the statement. Later Wednesday, the company said most of its critical computer systems were back online. But Thursday morning, the company told dealerships another incident had happened. North Carolina-based Sonic Automotive said it was a \u201ccybersecurity incident.\u201d CNN has asked CDK to confirm. Are systems still shut down? CDK said it proactively shut down most of its systems after it experienced an additional cyber incident late in the evening on Wednesday, June 19. \u201cIn partnership with third party experts, we are assessing the impact and providing regular updates to our customers. We remain vigilant in our efforts to reinstate our services and get our dealers back to business as usual as quickly as possible,\u201d the company said in a statement Thursday. On Thursday afternoon, the company said it still had no new information. The company told dealers the systems could be down for several days, according to two sources briefed on the situation. What does CDK Global do? CDK Global provides data and technology to different automotive dealerships. Its systems are used by roughly 15,000 car dealerships across the United States and Canada. CDK operates different products that car dealers use to handle things like keeping records of negotiated deals to scheduling and communicating about service. Not every dealer uses CDK\u2019s products, and even those that do may not use them for everything, but the system shutdown has been a problem for many. To protect customer privacy, customers\u2019 details aren\u2019t written out on a piece of paper that\u2019s just sitting on a desk anymore. Instead, information about deals and customer appointments is\u00a0kept in a server that\u2019s now impossible for salespeople affected by the outage to access. Why is this a bad time for dealerships? The outage can eat into sales during the first official weekend of the summer. Summer is car-buying season. CDK said it themselves in a blog post on its site last week. Post Memorial Day, \u201cthis presents increased opportunities for vehicle sales, service and, of course, revenue. It also means that it\u2019s time to roll out your summer Sales and Service marketing campaigns.\u201d In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Sonic Automotive said the outage resulted in disruptions to its dealer management system hosted by CDK, \u201cwhich supports critical dealership operations including those supporting sales, inventory and accounting functions and its customer relationship management system.\u201d The company said that while the outage has affected its business operations, it hasn\u2019t determined the financial impact. Can I still buy a car? Jeff Ramsey, an executive with Ourisman Auto Group, which is headquartered in Maryland, told CNN the shutdown is a major hassle and could cost his dealerships some business. Customers who are delayed in closing a sale at one of his dealerships could just find a dealer nearby that\u2019s not having these issues and buy a new vehicle there, instead. However, some affected dealerships are still selling cars. \u201cMy selling team can hand-write a buyer\u2019s order,\u201d said Brian Benstock, general manager of Paragon Honda and Paragon Acura in Long Island City, New York. But salespeople could lack access to customer agreements that had been previously negotiated, making it harder to close those sales, dealers CNN spoke with said. There\u2019s more than just the negotiated price of the car involved, since these agreements can involve rebates and incentives, some of which customers must show they\u2019re qualified for. What are automakers saying? Ramsey, whose company operates a number of dealerships, said automakers including Kia, Toyota and Stellantis, which makes Jeep and Dodge vehicles, have been very helpful with finding ways to serve customers even with all technology issues. Ford also said its dealerships involved in the CDK outage have alternate ways to take care of customers. \u201cAlthough there is an industry-wide system outage for some dealers who use CDK, Ford and Lincoln customers are able to receive sales and service support due to alternative processes available to our dealers. While a customer\u2019s local dealer remains the best place for information about their sales and service needs, they can always contact the Ford Customer Relationship Center at 1-800-392-3673,\u201d Ford said in a statement shared with CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/business/cdk-global-car-dealership-outage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing. Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive. Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year. The stock is one of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that have powered the lion\u2019s share of the market\u2019s returns this year, boosted by Wall Street\u2019s bet that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in tech.

{"id": "2024_06_23_business_cdk-cyber-attack-global-outage", "text": "Retail software provider CDK Global says it will likely take several days for its software to be back online and operational, as the company grapples with a system\u00a0outage that has paralyzed nearly 15,000 car dealerships across North America since Wednesday. The data provider\u2019s software, which dealerships use to manage everything from scheduling to records, said Saturday it has begun restoring its software. \u201cWe anticipate that the process will take several days to complete, and in the interim we are continuing to actively engage with our customers and provide them with alternative\u00a0ways to conduct business,\u201d a CDK spokesperson told CNN on Saturday. CDK has said it is working to investigate the shutdown after two cyber incidents brought its systems to a standstill. The company has not confirmed who was behind the incidents. Bloomberg previously reported the company was negotiating with an Eastern European-based hacker group demanding tens of millions of dollars in ransom to end the outage. CDK has not responded Sunday to CNN\u2019s request for comment about the reported ransom. Dealers implement temporary solutions Many car manufacturers and dealerships have scrambled to implement temporary solutions to maintain retail operations while their computer software remains offline. In an automated message via its toll-free number Saturday, CDK advised dealership employees to be cautious of phishing scams and take precautions to secure sensitive information such as passwords. Mike Stanton, the president and CEO of the National Automobile Dealers Association, told CNN in a statement the group \u201ccontinues seeking information from CDK on the nature and scope of the cyber incident, so dealers are able to respond appropriately.\u201d \u201cThousands of franchised new-car dealerships rely on CDK to run their businesses and this outage has impacted dealers\u2019 ability to provide a seamless customer experience and process transactions efficiently,\u201d he added. The system shutdown could slow down business and cause shipping delays at dealerships as the summer season gears up. Dealership sales in 2023 topped $1.2 trillion in the United States, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. Car manufacturer Ford told CNN it is working with dealers to set up alternative software systems and other workarounds. A company spokesperson emphasized the effects of the outage will vary from dealer to dealer. Ford said it encourages customers to contact their local dealership for information. Several dealerships on the East Coast told CNN on Sunday they are manually filling out forms to process sales. Some businesses mentioned they are having issues with registering purchased cars with the state, as they rely on CDK\u2019s software to send registration information to their respective motor vehicle department. One used car dealership told CNN it has been filing paperwork by hand and sending runners to the car registry with the paperwork. Another dealer said they\u2019re still selling cars but can\u2019t complete transactions in a timely manner. In a Friday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Penske Automotive said while its auto dealers don\u2019t use CDK Global, its Premier Trucking Group division \u2014 which mainly serve businesses \u2014 does use CDK\u2019s dealer management system. Penske said it was working on implementing response plans and its 48 PTG locations remain operational. In another SEC filing, Sonic Automotive said it was also operational but was instating \u201cworkaround solutions to minimize the disruption\u00a0caused by this CDK outage.\u201d The company added the incident will likely negatively impact Sonic\u2019s financial and business operations.

{"id": "2024_06_24_business_consumers-are-pulling-back-but-theyre-still-going-out-for-steak", "text": "\u201cGod I love Texas Roadhouse,\u201d began one thread on Reddit, with over 1,000 upvotes. \u201cTexas Roadhouse never disappoints,\u201d began another, with over 5,000 votes. A third touted the \u201cincredible value.\u201d If there\u2019s anything Americans love, it\u2019s cheap meat. So business is booming at Texas Roadhouse and LongHorn Steakhouse, even as Americans pull back elsewhere. In the quarter ending on March 26, sales at company-owned Texas Roadhouse locations open at least 18 months jumped 8.4% compared to the year before. And in the three months through May 26, sales at Longhorn Steakhouse locations open at least 16 months rose 4%. Longhorn, which is owned by Darden Restaurants, outperformed the other chains in Darden\u2019s portfolio, including Olive Garden. That\u2019s all happening as Americans curtail retail spending and plan to shell out less for vacations this summer. Most restaurant chains are feeling the heat, with even McDonald\u2019s reporting that lower-income consumers are pulling back. The two eateries have a history of performing well during periods of economic uncertainty \u2014\u00a0a few years ago, the pair were standouts as inflation-weary Americans began to pull back on spending. It may seem counterintuitive for sales at steakhouses to rise when people feel short on cash. But both Texas Roadhouse and Longhorn Steakhouse seem to have done what every restaurant wishes it could: Make people feel like they\u2019re getting a good deal when they need it most. An affordable luxury When it comes to steakhouses, Texas Roadhouse and LongHorn Steakhouse are on the cheaper end, noted Jim Salera, a research analyst at Stephens. \u201cThat average meal at Longhorn or Texas Roadhouse is actually very affordable,\u201d when compared to local establishments or higher-end chains like STK Steakhouse. The average check per person at Longhorn Steakhouse was $26, Salera said, according to a recent presentation from the Cheesecake Factory, which outlined its competitors\u2019 pricing. At Texas Roadhouse, the average check was $22. \u201cFor their core consumer, it really represents an affordable luxury,\u201d Salera said. Americans might sacrifice vacations or spend less on home goods to save money, but still feel comfortable splurging on a night out. \u201cNo one gives up everything at the same time.\u201d And it might not feel like such a splurge when you\u2019re getting a hearty meal of meat and potatoes. As a recent Bank of America note discussing Longhorn\u2019s results put it: \u201cConsumers recognize the center-of-plate value offered by steak.\u201d Plus, those checks may appear especially reasonable when fast food and other restaurants\u2019 prices are way up. Many restaurant chains have hiked their prices since the pandemic, not only because of high costs, but because they realized that diners would pay. Frustrated customers are finally pushing back, prompting restaurant chains to try to reverse course by offering short-term discounts and meal deals (but not lowering their overall prices). In contrast, both Longhorn and Texas Roadhouse have, made a point of keeping their regular prices relatively low, BTIG restaurant analyst Peter Saleh told CNN. They\u2019ve been trying to raise prices below inflation \u201cfor a while now,\u201d he said.  That approach could be why Texas Roadhouse and Longhorn Steakhouse consistently earn top marks on the American Customer Satisfaction Index, Saleh noted. Longhorn has also made moves to improve its menu. Back in June 2022, Darden CEO Rick Cardenas said during an analyst call that the chain \u201chas made significant investments over the past few years in the quality of their food.\u201d Might as well go out It\u2019s not just about low prices compared to other restaurants. It\u2019s also about what\u2019s happening at the supermarket. While grocery prices overall have been moderating, beef has stayed expensive. In the 12 months through May, uncooked beef steaks\u2019 prices went up 5.7%, according to inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. When people see pricey steaks in the meat aisle, it\u2019s easier for them to justify going out for a nice steak dinner, noted Salera. Texas Roadhouse also mentioned the trend during a recent analyst call. \u201cRetail demand has been probably a little bit weaker,\u201d said Michael Bailen, senior director of investor relations at Texas Roadhouse. That has likely \u201cled to a benefit for us.\u201d Bailen noted that grocers may be offering deals on certain cuts, like strip steaks, but not ribeyes, making restaurant ribeyes seem like a steal in comparison. Going out to eat can also release the anxiety some shoppers feel about ruining a supermarket steak, Salera said. \u201cFrom the consumer perspective they\u2019ll say, \u2018Okay, rather than me buy a steak at Kroger and then bring it home and mess it up, I can just pay somebody to prepare it for me.\u2019\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/business/consumers-are-pulling-back-but-theyre-still-going-out-for-steak/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_business_ups-delivery-vans-air-conditioning", "text": "This was supposed to be the year that air conditioning came to UPS delivery vans. It hasn\u2019t worked out that way. Despite a promise in the contract reached with the Teamsters union last year, UPS has not yet purchased any new vans with AC, even as temperatures soar across the country and the dangers of extreme heat put workers in harms way in and out of doors. Almost none of the nearly 100,000 brown package vans have AC. Temperatures inside the trucks, both the cab and especially the cargo space where drivers need to go to fetch and drop off packages, can regularly get well over 120 degrees, according to the Teamsters union, which represents more than 300,000 UPS employees. The union\u2019s demand for relief from the heat for its nearly 100,000 members working as delivery drivers was a major sticking point in contract negotiations last year between the union and the package delivery giant.\u00a0It was far more than an issue of comfort; it was a worker safety issue, according to the union. Drivers have been known to suffer heatstroke, with some coming close to death, while on the job in the vans. And as part of the contract reached in late July of last year, UPS agreed that all vans purchased after January 1 would include air conditioning. UPS also agreed to retrofit existing vans with fans in the cab, heat shields under the cargo area and what are known as \u201cscoop air intakes\u201d in the cargo area. The fans have been installed in all the vans, UPS said. About two thirds have been retrofitted with the heat shields and air scoops, reducing the temperature in the rear cargo by about 17 degrees on average, according to the company. But there have been no vans purchased this year, so no additional AC vans are on the roads. The company said van purchase decisions are based on package volume and the need to replace existing fleet, and there has been no need to make purchases so far. The Teamsters are not pleased by the lack of progress on the AC. \u201cWe are midway\u00a0into the summer, and frankly UPS is not moving fast enough,\u201d said the union in a statement to CNN. \u201cWe are aware that UPS has installed all contractually required second fans, and UPS is ahead of schedule in the installation of heat shields and air induction scoops for package compartment ventilation. But it\u2019s not enough.\u201d There are a small number of vans \u2013 in the hundreds \u2013 that have AC. Those are electric vans, or specialized vans for rural area that can go on gravel roads, UPS said. But they make up only a small fraction of the 94,000 UPS package vans on American roads. The number of vans with AC was bound to grow slowly. Some vans can last for more than 15 years. Retrofitting the existing fleet was going to bring more immediate relief. UPS told CNN it is very concerned with workers\u2019 safety and that AC was never going to be key to its heat mitigation efforts. In addition to the heat shield and air scoops, it has installed an additional 1,500 ice machines and 1,700 water fountains in its facilities. It said it also provided specialized cooling gear for UPS drivers and inside staff\u00a0to wear, as well as water jugs for drivers. And for inside workers it has installed additional fans in its buildings\u00a0and will install more. But AC is still a rarity in the UPS vans on the road.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/business/ups-delivery-vans-air-conditioning/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_tech_china-huawei-harmony-os-growth-intl-hnk", "text": "Huawei is in the midst of one of the most stunning comebacks in the history of the tech industry. The Chinese giant, which has been a flashpoint in the escalating rivalry between Washington and Beijing, says more than 900 million smartphones now use its in-house operating system Harmony OS. \u201cWe have done in 10 years what our European and American counterparts have done in more than 30 years, and have achieved independent control of the core technology of the operating system,\u201d Richard Yu, the chairman of Huawei\u2019s consumer business group, said at a developer forum on Friday. Harmony, which is called \u201cHongmeng\u201d in Chinese, was first unveiled in 2019, months after Huawei was placed on a US trade blacklist that barred American firms from\u00a0selling tech and software\u00a0to the Chinese tech company without a license. US policymakers have long claimed that Huawei poses a national security risk, alleging that the Chinese government could use the company\u2019s equipment to spy. The company repeatedly denied those allegations, but that didn\u2019t stop some American allies \u2014 such as the UK \u2014 limiting Huawei\u2019s role in building 5G networks. The US ban prevented companies like Google\u00a0(GOOGL)\u00a0from supplying new Huawei devices with its version of Android OS. Those restrictions dealt a huge blow to the Chinese firm\u2019s smartphone ambitions at the time, with some analysts predicting the Huawei phone would become \u201ca brick.\u201d Now the company is once again making its way back to the top. It\u2019s also venturing into new businesses. Last year, it launched an electric sedan to take on Tesla\u2019s Model S. And it has big ambitions in artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia (NVDA), which is running neck and neck with Microsoft (MSFT) as the\u00a0most valuable public company\u00a0in the world, earlier this year named Huawei a top competitor in a number of areas, including in the\u00a0production of processors\u00a0that power AI systems. Yu said Friday that Huawei\u2019s own AI framework, composed of its Ascend processors, was 1.1 times more effective in training large language models than mainstream international offerings. He did not name the competitors. A surprise development But it\u2019s in smartphones that the revival is so far most obvious. Sales of Huawei\u2019s flagship smartphones rose 72% in the first five months of 2024, compared to the same period a year ago, Yu added, underscoring the company\u2019s ambitions to claw its way back to the top despite severe US restrictions. The Shenzhen-based conglomerate\u2019s popular Mate 60 Pro smartphone made headlines last year when the US government\u00a0sought more information\u00a0about the model, which included a sophisticated processor. Its debut shocked industry experts who questioned how the company could\u00a0acquire\u00a0such  chips following sweeping efforts by the US to restrict China\u2019s access to foreign chip technology because of national security concerns. The company\u2019s net profit soared 564% to $2.71 billion in the first quarter, and that robust jump comes after it recorded its\u00a0fastest revenue growth\u00a0in four years in 2023, thanks to a pick-up in its consumer segment and income from new businesses like smart car components. Huawei is also going after another of the biggest companies in the world. The success of its smartphones in China have directly impacted Apple (AAPL) in the premium segment, according to data from Counterpoint Research in April. The iPhone maker, which led China\u2019s smartphone market with a near 20% share in the first quarter of 2023, fell to third spot in the first three months of\u00a0this\u00a0year, according to Counterpoint. Its market share stood at 15.7%, while Huawei\u2019s jumped to 15.5%, from 9.3% in 2023. Sales of the iPhone began bouncing back in May, after the company aggressively cut prices in its largest overseas market.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/tech/china-huawei-harmony-os-growth-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_business_boeing-families-lawsuit", "text": "Families that lost loved ones in two Boeing 737 Max crashes said on Wednesday that the company committed the \u201cdeadliest corporate crime in US history\u201d and asked the Justice Department to fine the company the maximum $24 billion it could face in a criminal trial. The families wrote to the Department of Justice asking for the fine as the US government considers criminal prosecution of Boeing. The Justice Department said last month that Boeing\u2019s recent string of safety lapses and mishaps constituted a violation of its 2021 agreement that allowed the company to avoid charges for 737 Max crashes in Indonesia in October 2018 and in Ethiopia in March 2019 that killed 346 people. The \u201cappropriate action now is an aggressive criminal prosecution\u201d against Boeing including a quick jury trial and \u201ccriminal prosecutions of the responsible corporate officials,\u201d including former CEO Dennis Muilenburg, the families\u2019 attorney wrote. \u201cBecause time is of the essence to avoid any statute of limitations from running (out), the Department should begin these prosecutions promptly,\u201d they wrote in the 32-page letter, which was sent by Paul Cassell, an attorney representing the families. The letter also asks the Justice Department for an independent corporate monitor to oversee Boeing\u2019s safety measures and to direct it in its efforts to improve its quality. Boeing did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. In May, the Department of Justice notified Boeing that it had breached terms of\u00a0its\u00a02021 agreement following a January incident in which a\u00a0door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines flight\u00a0shortly after takeoff in January. The Justice Department said in its letter that it has not yet determined how it will proceed and Boeing had the opportunity to respond to its breach of the agreement \u2013 and steps it has taken to remediate the situation \u2013 by last week. The DOJ said it will let the court know by July 7 how it will proceed. Boeing, in a previous statement, said it has upheld its end of the bargain. \u201cWe believe that we have honored the terms of that agreement, and look forward to the opportunity to respond to the Department on this issue,\u201d the company said. \u201cAs we do so, we will engage with the Department with the utmost transparency, as we have throughout the entire term of the agreement.\u201d On Tuesday, current Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun testified before both Republican and Democratic senators. He apologized to families of victims of the two 737 Max crashes that took place before he became CEO and admitted that Boeing is \u201cfar from perfect.\u201d He also acknowledged that the company has a lot of work to do to regain public trust. The 2021 deferred prosecution agreement that Boeing reached with the Justice Department was harshly criticized by the family members and some members of Congress at that time. Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion, but most of that money - $1.77 billion \u2013 was paid to the airlines that owned the grounded planes, money that Boeing had already agreed to pay. It also agreed to set up a $500 million fund to compensate family members, which it had also already agreed to do in the face of lawsuits, and it would have paid a $244 million fine to the federal government. The $24 billion, as significant as it would be, would still be less than the $31.9 billion in core operating losses it has reported since the second crash of the plane in 2019 resulted in a 20-month grounding of its best-selling jet. Boeing has identified more than $20 billion in direct costs from that grounding, and that doesn\u2019t count the tens of billions in lost sales revenue and increased interest costs as its debt soared to cover its losses. Nor does it include the costs incurred since the January 5 Alaska Airlines incident in which a door plug blew off a 737 Max and the FAA put limits on its rate of production due to new questions about the safety and quality of its planes. \u2013CNN\u2019s Evan Perez contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/business/boeing-families-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

Donald Trump\u00a0can\u2019t quit\u00a0Fox News. The Republican presidential candidate may lash out in strong terms at the right-wing channel for supposedly not being sufficiently loyal to him, but a fresh analysis of the content posted on his\u00a0Truth Social\u00a0page shows that he promotes the outlet more than any other. In the month of May, Trump posted 56 videos from Fox News, dwarfing the volume of content he posted from any other outlet, according to the analysis conducted by\u00a0The Righting, a website that monitors right-wing media. In addition to the 56 video clips, Trump posted an additional six articles linking to\u00a0FoxNews.com, for a total of 62 pieces of content from the\u00a0Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch-controlled media organization, according to the analysis, which was provided first to\u00a0Reliable Sources. \u201cThis analysis shows that despite Mr. Trump\u2019s hot and cold relationship with the Fox News Channel, it was clearly his number one choice in May to shower his followers with links to content that he obviously felt were aligned with his messages,\u201d said\u00a0Howard Polskin, president and founder of The Righting. Comparatively, Trump posted 26 video clips from the upstart internet streamer\u00a0Right Side Broadcasting Network, 11 videos from the pro-Trump cable channel\u00a0Newsmax, and 5 from the far-right\u00a0Real America\u2019s Voice. He posted eight links to Real America\u2019s Voice, only three to\u00a0Breitbart, and one to the\u00a0New York Post. Polskin noted that his analysis indicated Trump has a \u201cpreference for fringe outlets like RSBN and Real America\u2019s Voice over more established outlets like the\u00a0Washington Examiner\u00a0and the\u00a0Washington Times.\u201d The Righting analysis also found that, in addition to the content Trump posts from right-wing sources, he also links to mainstream news organizations when it fits his agenda. In May, he linked to the\u00a0Associated Press,\u00a0The New York Times,\u00a0CNN,\u00a0The Washington Post,\u00a0POLITICO,\u00a0NBC News,\u00a0The New Yorker, and\u00a0Reuters. \u201cWhile Trump consistently disparages mainstream or progressive news outlets as \u2018fake news,\u2019 he\u2019ll link to those sources if it shows the Biden campaign or Democrats in a poor light,\u201d Polskin said. Indeed, Polskin\u2019s analysis pulls back the curtain on how Trump works the media. While he has publicly bashed Murdoch and Fox News, in addition to waging an unrelenting war on the press, he continues to promote their content when it fits into the narrative that he is trying to sell his supporters. The warped feedback loop is yet another way in which he exploits the media for his own ends.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/media/donald-trumps-truth-social-media-diet/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

The university, which reiterated its commitment to combatting antisemitism, did not share any specifics for the leave. But the Washington Free Beacon and later the Columbia Spectator published images or descriptions of school officials  purportedly sharing messages during a May 31 panel discussion that focused on Jewish life on campus amid tensions over the war abroad. Columbia College Dean Josef Sorett said in a statement to the Spectator that he \u201cdeeply regret(s)\u201d his role in the texts. CNN has not been able to independently vet the images, the substance of the purported texts or the identity of the conversations\u2019 participants. \u201cThe Dean of Columbia College informed his team yesterday that three administrators have been placed on leave pending a university investigation of the incident that occurred at the College alumni reunion several weeks ago,\u201d a Columbia spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThe Dean reiterated his commitment to learning from this situation and other incidents over the last year to build a community of respect and healthy dialogue,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe are committed to combatting antisemitism and taking sustained, concrete action to ensure Columbia is a campus where Jewish students and everyone in our community feels safe, valued, and able to thrive.\u201d In a follow-up statement to CNN, a spokesperson said that \u201cColumbia College is attending to this situation with the utmost seriousness,\u201d later adding, \u201cas that effort is pending the College will not be at liberty to discuss any specifics regarding the investigation or the initial incident.\u201d The spokesperson added \u201cwe are committed to confronting antisemitism, discrimination and hate.\u201d Columbia has been swirling in headlines for months now as the university faces intense scrutiny for their handling of campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war \u2013 leading, at one point, to a vote of no confidence in its president Minouche Shafik. A group within the university\u2019s arts and sciences faculty in May rebuked Shafik for the administration\u2019s response to the protests, although fewer than a fifth of the full-time faculty voted. Columbia was the site where dozens were arrested for storming Hamilton Hall during a pro-Palestinian protest in April. Charges were recently dismissed against many of the participants. Representative Virginia Foxx, who chairs the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, which is investigating Columbia for its handling of antisemitism on campus, released a statement earlier this month following reports saying in part: \u201cI was appalled, but sadly not surprised, to learn Columbia administrators exchanged disparaging text messages during a panel that discussed antisemitism at the University.\u201d \u201cColumbia\u2019s Jewish community deserves better than this,\u201d Foxx continued in the statement obtained by CNN. Josef Sorett, the dean of Columbia College, said in a statement provided to CNN he was cooperating with the investigation. \u201cI deeply regret my role in these text exchanges and the impact they have had on our community,\u201d Sorett said in a statement he sent to the Columbia College Board of Visitors Friday and provided to CNN. \u201cI am cooperating fully with the University\u2019s investigation of these matters. I am committed to learning from this situation and to the work of confronting antisemitism, discrimination and hate at Columbia.\u201d Citing an unnamed university official, the New York Times also reported that Sorett \u201cwill be recused from matters relating to the investigation while continuing to serve as dean.\u201d CNN is reaching out to the other administrators allegedly involved in the text exchange.

Homeowners in America aren\u2019t the only ones struggling with an unaffordable housing market. Renters are also bearing the brunt. A report from Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies released last week showed that both homeowners and renters in recent years have become increasingly burdened by climbing housing costs. The report, based on an analysis of existing data, said that nearly one in four households that own a home \u201care now stretched worryingly thin.\u201d The cost burdens are even worse for renters. \u201cFor renters, the landscape is even more challenging,\u201d the Harvard report said. \u201cWhile rents have been rising faster than incomes for decades, the pandemic-era rent surge produced an unprecedented affordability crisis.\u201d Renters who spend more than half of their household income on housing and utilities rose in 2022 to a new record high of 12.1 million, up 1.5 million from levels seen before the Covid-19 pandemic. Allocating such a high proportion of household income to rent makes them vulnerable to becoming unhoused if they face an unexpected financial issue, such as an unexpected medical bill. That\u2019s all part of a broader struggle in the US housing market, and recent data shows that it hasn\u2019t gotten any better. A persistent lack of homes available for sale is spurring bidding wars. Elevated mortgage rates are keeping sellers and some buyers on the sidelines. \u201cHousing costs are a particular pain point for American households,\u201d Lael Brainard, director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, said Thursday at an event in Washington. \u201cCongress really does need to act here,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Senate could act tomorrow and we would have tax credits for 200,000 additional affordable units,\u201d referring to a bill that recently passed the US House. Speaking at an event hosted by the Urban Institute, Brainard outlined the Biden administration\u2019s attempts to fix America\u2019s housing market, such as a cap on annual rent increases for the 2 million households in \u201clow-income housing tax credit\u201d units and a reduction in Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance premiums that took effect in the spring. \u201cAlready, nearly 700,000 homeowners are saving roughly $900 annually as a result of the Administration\u2019s reduction in mortgage interest premiums for FHA-backed loans,\u201d Brainard said. The Harvard report said that \u201cstate and local experimentation with regulatory reforms and incentives will incrementally add affordable homes\u201d and that there\u2019s a pressing \u201cneed for down payment support and access to low-interest mortgage products to close racial gaps and put homeownership within reach for households with modest incomes.\u201d Apple\u2019s new China problem: ChatGPT is banned there Apple is banking on its upcoming AI features to boost iPhone sales especially in China, where demand has been lagging. But there\u2019s a problem: ChatGPT \u2014 soon to be integrated into Siri \u2014 is banned in China, reports my colleague Samantha Murphy Kelly. In a presentation earlier this month, Apple (AAPL) showed off its proprietary technology called Apple Intelligence to power compelling new AI\u00a0features\u00a0and announced a\u00a0partnership with OpenAI\u00a0to also use its viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity. (When Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry, ChatGPT can step in.) The move signaled how Apple is trying to expedite the latest buzzy technology at a time when tech rivals, such as Microsoft, Google, Meta and Samsung, have already found their AI\u00a0footing. A deal with OpenAI could help Apple close the gap. But China is one of the first countries in the world to regulate the generative AI technology that powers these popular services. In August, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s top internet watchdog, rolled out new guidelines for the industry, requiring companies to seek approval before deployment. The organization has approved more than 100 AI models as of March, all from Chinese companies. Read more here. Up Next Monday:\u00a0Fed Governor Christopher Waller delivers remarks.

The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_business_netflix-house-locations-experiential-venues", "text": "Netflix is opening massive entertainment venues in two cities that it says will allow fans to immerse themselves in the worlds of their favorite shows. The \u201cexperiential\u201d complexes, called Netflix Houses, will include elaborate events, themed gift shops and restaurants. In a repurposing of empty retail space, the houses will occupy former department store locations at Dallas Galleria and King of Prussia mall (near Philadelphia). Both will span more than 100,000 square feet and are set to open in 2025, according to the streaming giant. It\u2019s Netflix\u2019s TV tweak on a theme park. For fans of its \u201cSquid Game\u201d dark drama and related reality show, for example, Netflix promises to recreate the program\u2019s Glass Bridge challenge. Competitors walk or jump across clear panels that shatter \u2014 and drop them \u2014 if they stand on the wrong one. It\u2019s a risky move. Critics of the expansion note that attracting repeat business will be challenging. \u201cOne of the keys to success will be to keep the offer refreshed, so that it keeps people coming back to what\u2019s new,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData. Netflix has already had considerable success with elaborate touring productions and events tied to some of its higher-profile programming. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is currently hosting a tour of \u201cBridgerton\u201d High Tea; Toronto has a \u201cKnives Out\u201d dinner party; and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil offers an immersive \u201cStranger Things\u201d experience. Risks and rewards All this is not a new idea, though. \u201cDisney has monetized its content for years and has a very successful retail business through licensing, its own stores, and shop-in-shop concepts,\u201d said Saunders. For Netflix, it\u2019s just the latest move in a series of efforts to broaden its profile and income beyond standard streaming\u2014 even though the bulk of its profits have come from its core business. These new initiatives come at a time profits in the streaming industry are getting squeezed. So the company has cut back on creating original programming but has expanded its video game offerings, rolling out mobile-friendly games from the \u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d franchise. In a brand extension, It also partnered with Williams Sonoma on a line of \u201cBridgerton\u201d-themed dinnerware, paper goods, foods and linens. TikTok influencer, product reviewer and \u201cBridgerton\u201d fan Carrie Berk, who has twice attended \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Ball\u201d said she thinks Netflix\u2019s new venture will be met with success. (She was not compensated by Netflix or given tickets to the events.) \u201cI think that it\u2019s brilliant that Netflix is bringing that magic IRL!\u201d she said. (IRL stands for \u201cin real life.\u201d) For years, \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Ball\u201d has been staged in various cities two or three times daily. Fans could enjoy dances and watch performances by violin players and acrobats dressed in historically accurate garb under chandelier lighting. In keeping with the show\u2019s plot, the Queen named a \u201cDiamond of the Season\u201d at each performance. Social media influencers were invited to write a letter and make their case for why they should be chosen, illustrating Netflix\u2019s keen interest in the social media world. Now, \u201cNetflix House represents the next generation of our distinctive offerings,\u201d said Netflix Chief Marketing Officer Marian Lee, in a statement. \u201cThe venues will bring our beloved stories to life in new ever-changing, and unexpected ways.\u201d Berk agreed and told CNN of her experience, \u201cIt really made me feel like I stepped into the world of the show.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/business/netflix-house-locations-experiential-venues/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_media_jeff-bezos-will-lewis-washington-post", "text": "Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of The Washington Post, broke his silence Tuesday on the mounting turmoil within his newspaper, expressing support for maintaining high standards at the storied publication as questions swirl over the ethical integrity of its new publisher, Will Lewis. \u201cI know you\u2019ve already heard this from Will, but I wanted to also weigh in directly: the journalistic standards and ethics at The Post will not change,\u201d Bezos said in an email to top newsroom leaders, signaling support for Lewis, though not explicitly. Bezos added in the memo, which was obtained by CNN, that \u201cit can\u2019t be business as usual\u201d at The Post, which has been plagued by financial and audience woes. \u201cThe world is evolving rapidly and we do need to change as a business. With your support, we\u2019ll do that and lead this great institution into the future,\u201d Bezos wrote. \u201cBut, as the newsroom leaders who\u2019ve been shaping and guiding our coverage, you also know our standards at The Post have always been very high. That can\u2019t change \u2014 and it won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cYou have my full commitment on maintaining the quality, ethics, and standards we all believe in,\u201d Bezos added. The memo to The Post\u2019s top personnel comes after serious questions were raised about Lewis, who has been the subject of several explosive reports in recent days that raise questions over whether he is committed to the newspaper\u2019s rigorous journalistic standards. The New York Times\u00a0reported over the weekend\u00a0that, in his Fleet Street days, Lewis assigned an article that was based on stolen phone records. And The Post itself reported in a 3,000-word\u00a0front page story\u00a0Sunday that a \u201cthief\u201d who used deceptive tactics to obtain private material had ties with Lewis\u2019 hand-picked incoming top editor, Robert Winnett. The stories, which landed like a one-two punch in The Post\u2019s newsroom, followed reports that Lewis tried to suppress stories at The Post and NPR about his role cleaning up Rupert Murdoch\u2019s UK phone hacking scandal, when he served as a lieutenant to the right-wing media mogul. Instead of deescalating the situation, Lewis initially lashed out, going so far as to criticize his own media reporters and launch an on-the-record attack aimed at the well-respected NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik, who he referred to as an \u201cactivist, not a journalist.\u201d Lewis later sent a memo to staffers, striking a notably different, non-confrontational tone. But the note did not quell the growing anger within The Post. Inside The Post\u2019s newsroom, morale has plunged in recent months as alarmed staffers express frustration over Lewis\u2019 conduct and worries over the future direction of the newspaper under his leadership. Interviews with nearly a dozen Post staffers and others familiar with the internal dynamics of the newspaper this week revealed a workforce that has grown increasingly dismayed by the situation, with some searching for work elsewhere. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the professor and senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, told CNN on Monday that Bezos should dismiss Lewis. Sonnenfeld, who has advised US presidents and scores of corporate leaders, said that if he were advising Bezos, he would tell him Lewis has \u201clost legitimacy to lead\u201d and it\u2019s time to \u201cclean the house.\u201d \u201cThis is a tragic meltdown of the conscience of American journalism bringing shame to the Katharine Graham, Ben Bradlee, Marty Baron legacy of collaboration, courage, and integrity,\u201d Sonnenfeld said. \u201cBezos must recruit an accomplished, experienced editor whom journalists admire and trust.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/media/jeff-bezos-will-lewis-washington-post/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}

Earlier this month, a bankruptcy judge ruled that Jones\u2019 personal assets would be liquidated to help pay off the nearly $1.5 billion he owes the families of victims of the Sandy Hook massacre. But\u00a0at that time, the judge ruled Jones\u2019\u00a0media company Free Speech Systems, the\u00a0parent\u00a0of Infowars, would not be liquidated partly because the process would be costly and lengthy. The dismissal of the bankruptcy case against the outlet meant that the families were free to go after Jones\u2019 assets, including Infowars, in state court.\u00a0Since Jones is the owner of\u00a0Free Speech Systems, a court appointed trustee was put in charge of the company. The trustee wrote on Sunday that since being appointed, he \u201cbegan planning to wind-up\u00a0(Free Speech Systems\u2019)\u00a0operations and liquidate its inventory.\u201d But the trustee\u00a0said the\u00a0process was \u201cderailed\u201d when\u00a0one\u00a0of the Sandy Hook\u00a0victim\u2019s parents\u00a0filed a motion in a Texas District Court to be granted custody of all of\u00a0Free Speech Systems\u2019\u00a0assets, including Infowars. As a result, Jones\u2019 trustee\u00a0asked the\u00a0bankruptcy judge for an emergency stay in\u00a0the\u00a0case to allow them to conduct an \u201corderly wind-down and sale process\u201d of Infowars. In a statement,\u00a0Christopher Mattei,\u00a0an attorney for\u00a0Sandy Hook families from Connecticut who were in favor of liquidating\u00a0the company, said \u201cthis is precisely the unfortunate situation that the Connecticut families hoped to avoid when we argued that the Free Speech Systems/InfoWars case should have remained with the bankruptcy court rather than being dismissed.\u201d \u201cThe Connecticut families are disappointed by this attempt to undercut the orderly and long overdue wind down of Alex Jones\u2019 InfoWars platform,\u201d Mattei said, referring to the attempt by one set of parents to go after FSS assets. \u201cFrom the beginning, they have led with dignity toward a resolution that is fair for every family and are grateful that the Chapter 7 Trustee has already filed a motion \u2013 with which eight of the nine families agree \u2013 supporting an equitable distribution of the FSS assets.\u201d Jones, who had\u00a0earlier this month\u00a0celebrated the judge\u2019s ruling\u00a0not to liquidate\u00a0Infowars\u2019 parent company, has acknowledged Infowars would likely only continue broadcasting for a few more months. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to move forward and maximize the amount of money we can make at Info\ufeffwars to then have a wind-down,\u201d Jones said outside the courthouse after the hearing dismissing his company\u2019s liquidation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/media/alex-jones-infowars-court-trustee/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_investing_premarket-stocks-trading", "text": "Traders could be forgiven for breaking out their champagne glasses, even though 2024 isn\u2019t halfway done yet. US stocks have leaped from all-time high to all-time high this year: the S&P 500 has surpassed its own record a staggering 31 times since January. That equates to a new all-time high about every four trading days. Investors have shrugged off elevated interest and inflation rates, a chaotic political and global environment and general economic uncertainty to give markets the best start to an election year on record. What\u2019s happening: Presidential election years are typically good for stocks. The S&P 500 alone has generated an average return of 7% during presidential election years since 1952, according to LPL Financial. If you limit that to election years in which the incumbent president is running for reelection, the average jumps to 12.2%. This year, the index has already far surpassed those average gains. The S&P 500 is 14.6% higher year-to-date \u2014 the best start to an election year on record, according to Goldman Sachs \u2014 and up nearly 31% from its October 2023 low at 4,117 points. So why is this election cycle different from all the others that have gone before? Gains are typically higher when incumbent presidents run for reelection, most likely because investors crave stability. And this election is the first since 1892 that the nominees of both major parties have occupied the White House, notes Ed Clissold, chief US strategist at Ned Davis Research. If one incumbent running for office reduces uncertainty, then two incumbents really reduces uncertainty. That could pull the typical year-end election relief rally forward, said Clissold. A reason to celebrate: Not only are stocks up, they\u2019re rarely going down. It\u2019s been 333 days since the S&P 500 recorded a decline of 2% or greater, which is the longest stretch since February 2018, wrote Goldman Sachs\u2019 Scott Rubner in a recent note to clients. His outlook for the latter half of the year remains positive \u2014 a good first half means a \u201cvery good\u201d second half, he wrote. \u201cThe impressive market rally continues, notable not only for its strength but also for its stability,\u201d wrote Nationwide\u2019s chief of investment research, Mark Hackett, in a note Friday. \u201c[T]here is no reason that the steady march higher can\u2019t persist, particularly as we approach the tailwind from election seasonality.\u201d Last week\u2019s rally was broad, assuaging some concerns from investors that recent gains have been concentrated in a few big names like tech darling Nvidia, which is up more than 155% so far this year. The equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 rose 1.12% and the small cap Russell 2000 gained 0.79% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was flat on the week. The sustained gains are causing some analysts to raise their year-end targets for the S&P 500.  Scott Chronert, research head of US equity strategy at Citigroup, raised his year-end target to 5,600 from 5,100 last week. Analysts at Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and UBS have also revised their expectations for the broad-based index higher. Yes, but: Market volatility in an election year tends to pick up in October and there are many months left in this cycle with potential surprises to come. Thursday brings CNN\u2019s televised debate between President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump. \u201cThere is plenty of scope for big headlines and for the candidates to gather some momentum or see it go into reverse,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank\u2019s Jim Reid. There\u2019s also the prospect that investors get complacent and begin to take the current bull market for granted. \u201cThe longer optimism remains high, the bigger the risk that it turns into complacency and leaves the market vulnerable to the next piece of negative news,\u201d said Clissold with Ned Davis Research. \u201cAn autumn pullback fits well time wise with potential downside earnings revisions, make-or-break decision time for the Fed, and election uncertainty. The risk is that one or more of those catalysts prove to be longer lasting, turning a pullback into something more,\u201d he said. A global view: The United States isn\u2019t the only country with an upcoming election. France and the UK both face elections in the coming weeks. While opinion polls suggest the opposition centre-left Labour Party is heading for a comfortable victory in the UK on July 4, the situation in France is much more uncertain, and markets have been rattled. French President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election after his centrist Renaissance party lost heavily to the far-right opposition in European elections. The first round of the French election will be held on June 30, with a second round on July 7. \u201cPolitical uncertainty is a near-term headwind to both sentiment (reflected through financial markets) and, now, activity,\u201d wrote Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management, of the upcoming elections. Until July, \u201cwe can anticipate volatility in European equity and debt markets.\u201d Alaska Airlines reaches tentative labor deal with flight attendants Alaska Airlines and its 7,000-member flight attendants union reached a tentative labor deal late Friday, concluding talks that lasted more than a year and a half, reports my colleague Chris Isidore. Terms of the deal have not been released, though the union called it a \u201crecord contract.\u201d The deal likely contains a significant pay raise, which has been a common demand across the airline industry and sought by unions whose members in some cases have not seen a pay increase in years. In April, the union announced to members it was seeking pay raises of between 43% to 56%, depending upon seniority, through 2026. Those pay raises would include back pay covering a period dating back a year and a half that they\u2019ve worked under the terms of the previous contract. In February, flight attendants from Alaska \u2014 along with American, United and Southwest \u2014held unprecedented coordinated\u00a0pickets\u00a0demanding new contracts. Since then, flight attendants at Southwest reached a deal that included an immediate 22.3% raise as of May 1 and $364 million in retroactive wages. Meanwhile, flight attendants at American and United are still seeking new deals. American flight attendants have asked to be released from restrictions so they can go on strike, but even if that is granted there would be months of cooling off periods before they could walk out, under the Railway Labor Act. Apple\u2019s new China problem: ChatGPT is banned there Apple is banking on its upcoming AI features to boost iPhone sales especially in China, where demand has been lagging. But there\u2019s a problem, reports my CNN colleague Samantha Murphy Kelly, ChatGPT \u2014 soon to be integrated into Siri \u2014 is banned in China. In a presentation earlier this month, Apple (AAPL) showed off its proprietary technology called Apple Intelligence to power compelling new AI\u00a0features\u00a0and announced a\u00a0partnership with OpenAI\u00a0to also use its viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity. (When Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry, ChatGPT can step in.) The move signaled how Apple is trying to expedite the latest buzzy technology at a time when tech rivals, such as Microsoft, Google, Meta and Samsung, have already found their AI\u00a0footing. A deal with OpenAI could help Apple close the gap. But\u00a0China\u00a0is one of the first countries in the world to regulate the generative AI technology that powers these popular services. In August, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s top internet watchdog, rolled out\u00a0new guidelines\u00a0for the industry, requiring companies to seek approval before deployment. The organization\u00a0has approved\u00a0more than 100 AI models as of March, all from Chinese companies. According to\u00a0a report\u00a0from the Wall Street Journal Thursday, Apple is looking for a Chinese AI company to partner with ahead of the iPhone\u2019s expected September launch, but it hasn\u2019t reached a deal yet. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The need to find a partner \u2014 and quickly \u2014 comes at a time when Apple\u2019s smartphone sales\u00a0tumbled\u00a0a stunning 10% in the first quarter of this year, according to market research firm IDC, due largely to iPhone sales sharply dropping in China. The company has lost momentum in China as nationalism, a rough economy and increased competition have also hurt sales. China is the company\u2019s second-largest market.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_business_employer-obligations-worker-safety-heat-waves", "text": "Summer is just starting in North America, and already an intense \u201cheat dome\u201d is forecast to affect more than half the US population this week. Some areas, including Montpelier, Vermont; Syracuse, New York; and Pittsburgh, haven\u2019t seen heat like this in about three decades. Along with stifling days comes the risk of developing dangerous heat-related conditions, such as dehydration, heat stress, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and other hazards. While you can take as many measures as you like to stay cool at home, what about when you go to work? What responsibilities does your employer have to prevent you from suffering a heat-related illness? And what can you do if you think those aren\u2019t being met? Under the federal law that created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, employers always have a duty to keep your workplace free of known hazards. \u201cThis includes protecting workers from heat-related hazards,\u201d OSHA notes on its website. And it applies whether you work outdoors or indoors. While some states have specific laws governing occupational heat exposure, there is no heat-specific federal regulation mandating how employers must prevent heat illness in the workplace. But they are expected to \u201ctake reasonable action to prevent their employees from illness and death.\u201d Nor is there a specific threshold that defines \u201cextreme heat,\u201d although OSHA said it is working \u201ctowards enacting a federal heat standard that encompasses indoor and outdoor workers.\u201d The heat an employee\u2019s body experiences will depend on a lot of factors beyond the general temperature.\u00a0\u201cFor someone working outside without shade and working on cement \u2013 the heat index is going to be higher for them than [if the thermometer says] it\u2019s 85 degrees,\u201d said attorney Jason Krasno, a senior partner at Krasno, Krasno & Onwudinjo, who specializes in worker compensation cases. The same goes if someone is working in high humidity or in rooms where air circulation is poor and there is no air conditioning. Anyone required to wear a uniform that doesn\u2019t breathe may be at greater risk of overheating. And an employee\u2019s underlying chronic conditions such as asthma and heart disease may make them more vulnerable to heat risks. At minimum, your employer should take basic preventative measures All that said, both OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which research the prevention of work-related illnesses and injury, provide recommendations for employers to follow as they seek to keep workers safe on hot days. They recommend companies: Have a heat illness prevention plan. It should outline procedures, supplies and equipment necessary to prevent workers from getting a heat-related illness, as well as an emergency action plan if a worker shows signs of distress. Make water easily accessible. \u201cEncourage workers to drink at least one cup every 20 minutes, even if they are not thirsty,\u201d according to OSHA recommendations. Allow regular rest breaks. These should be in the shade or a cool area. Give employees time to acclimate. OSHA recommends the so-called \u201c20% rule.\u201d \u201cOn the first day, don\u2019t allow employees to work more than 20% of a shift at full intensity in the heat. Increase their time by no more than 20% a day until they are used to working in the heat.\u201d In a worker\u2019s first few days, the agency notes, \u201cabsolutely all symptoms should be taken seriously\u201d and workers should be allowed to stop working and get an evaluation to see if they\u2019ve developed a heat-related illness. \u201cNew employees whose bodies have not had time to adjust to working in the heat are most vulnerable \u2014 nearly 3 out of 4 workers who die from heat-related causes die in their first week on the job,\u201d OSHA notes in its Extreme Heat Hazard Alert. Encourage employees to dress for the heat. That means wearing light-colored, loose fitting, breathable clothing. Monitor workers for signs and symptoms of heat illness. These include dizziness, fainting, nausea and muscle spasms. Also, do verbal checks frequently with workers who are wearing face coverings or wearing face equipment like a respirator. Managers should encourage employees to do the same for themselves and their coworkers. Should any signs appear, try to cool the worker down and \u201cwhen in doubt, call 911,\u201d OSHA recommends. Change work hours. Another OSHA-recommended accommodation employers may make when feasible is to alter employees\u2019 working hours so that they work primarily during the coolest parts of a day \u2014 such as very early morning or after the sun goes down, said attorney Alka Ramchandani-Raj, who is co-chair of\u00a0the occupational safety and health practice group at Littler, a law firm representing employers in employment law and labor practice issues. What you can do To find out more about your particular employer\u2019s obligations and commitment to providing a healthy workplace, first check the company\u2019s safety handbook to see what recommendations they build into their policies and what the best way is to alert managers about potentially unsafe working conditions, Ramchandani-Raj noted. Next, check to see which rules and recommendations your employer should be following in the state where you work. While more than 20 states are subject to federal OSHA requirements, which establish the most basic obligations of most US employers, your particular state may have its own OSHA-like agency that establishes more stringent rules. If you suspect your employer is not providing a healthy workplace, you can file a confidential complaint with OSHA either by calling 800-321-OSHA or filing online. \u201cYou have the right to speak up about hazards\u00a0without fear of retaliation,\u201d OSHA notes. The agency also noted that it \u201cis planning enhanced enforcement actions, with a strategic focus on geographic locations and industries where high heat impacts vulnerable worker populations.\u201d Translation: More inspection activity and greater enforcement. And, it added, \u201cOSHA will also be providing outreach and compliance assistance to ensure employers, including those not covered by the OSH Act, and worker organizations have the tools to protect workers from hazardous heat.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/business/employer-obligations-worker-safety-heat-waves/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/25/2024", "section": "business"}}
