{"id": "2024_05_10_economy_us-consumer-sentiment-plunges", "text": "Consumer sentiment plunged to the lowest level in six months as price increases reaccelerated, according to the latest University of Michigan survey of consumers, released Friday. Additionally, consumers are bracing for even higher price increases in the year ahead compared to readings from prior months, the survey found. The gauge, which is closely tracked by the Biden administration, plunged 13% from April\u2019s 77.2% reading, to 67.4%. That\u2019s the biggest one-month drop since mid-2021. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting consumer expectations to fall to just 76.9%. However, the latest reading is still better than last May, when inflation was running at 4%, versus the latest reading of 3.5%. Even though inflation is lower compared to a year ago, it\u2019s been moving in the wrong direction recently, shifting expectations for a rate cut from the Federal Reserve to the back burner. Perhaps the most daunting piece of the report for the Fed was year-ahead inflation expectations rising to 3.5% from 3.2% in April, even further away from the central bank\u2019s 2% target. Long-run inflation expectations also rose, to 3.1% from 3.0% in April. Since inflation expectations can effectively control the pace of price hikes, businesses take those expectations into account when pricing goods and services. The survey suggests that the recent optimism consumers had about the state of the economy is waning. Beyond inflation, they\u2019re also concerned about higher rates of unemployment, Joanne Hsu, the university\u2019s Surveys of Consumers director, said in a release. Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, found the survey particularly troubling since, in his view, \u201cthere\u2019s no single smoking gun explaining why consumers were more downbeat.\u201d Concerns about avian bird flu, which is driving up the price of chicken and beef, could partially explain the soured mood, he said. But there are also anxieties about geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, immigration and recent stock market declines. \u201cAnother potential issue is the end of tax season. Many Americans were likely surprised by higher tax bills this year after big gains in the stock market in 2023 and higher interest income from bank deposits and bonds last year,\u201d Adams said in a note Friday. Trouble ahead? The economy right now is performing very well by historical standards. For instance, the nation\u2019s unemployment rate has stayed below 4% for over two years, the longest such streak since the late 1960s. But it\u2019s tomorrow\u2019s economy that\u2019s worrying people even more than usual lately. The Michigan survey, as well as the most recent Conference Board survey on consumers\u2019 attitudes toward the economy, underpin heightened uncertainty about the latter half of this year, Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, said in a Friday note. In particular, \u201cuncertainty about the inflation path could suppress consumer spending in the coming months,\u201d Roach said, adding that he sees a rising risk of stagflation \u2014 when inflation rises while economic growth slows. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, however, said he is not worried in the least. He told reporters last week that he doesn\u2019t see \u201cthe stag or the \u2018flation.\u201d Consumers are expecting mortgage rates to continue climbing and are indefinitely putting off purchasing a home, according to a New Fed survey released earlier this week. Renting is also far from a bargain these days. Consumers are gearing up for even bigger increases compared to the expected rise in mortgage rates over the next year, the survey found. Additionally, in many parts of the country, the pace of rent increases is eroding recent wage gains. Another worrying sign is the rising rate of consumers becoming delinquent on expenses such as auto loans, credit card bills and rent. The New York Fed will release new data on household borrowing and indebtedness on Tuesday at 11 am ET.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-plunges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_success_college-tuition-payment-options", "text": "The good news is your child got into college and is preparing to enroll this fall. The bad news is that you\u2019ve just learned the aid package your child\u2019s school is offering is much smaller than you\u2019d hoped. That means your share of the total cost of college may be larger than what you have at the ready. The gap for some parents and students can be much worse if you consider top schools in New England, where the annual sticker price before aid is now $90,000 or more. The total average annual cost came to $60,420 at private four-year colleges in 2023, according to the College Board. After accounting for the average aid offer to offset tuition costs, students and their parents were still on the hook to pay an average of nearly $35,000. But even when students enroll in less expensive public universities, for any parent who doesn\u2019t have a fat 529 college savings and investment plan, or any at all, it\u2019s sobering to realize that in the next few months you\u2019re going to have to come up with a lot more money than you were expecting. Exactly how to do that is the question. \u201cThere is no magic bullet,\u201d said Beth Walker, founder of the Center for College Planning Solutions and author of \u201cNever Pay Retail for College.\u201d But here are some suggestions that may help, or at least buy you a little time to figure out how to handle all the education expenses coming due in the next four years \u2014 or longer, if you have younger kids who are also planning to go to college. Your child may have to borrow money. Try not to feel guilty If you never wanted your children to be saddled with debt before graduating from college, you might rethink that. Freshmen can take out a $5,500 federal Stafford loan at a favorable interest rate. Currently it\u2019s 5.50% but it resets every July. Over four years of college, students can take out a total of up to $27,000. What\u2019s more, they don\u2019t have to pay the money back while they\u2019re in school, and they can get a favorable income-driven repayment plan after graduating. \u201cIt\u2019s their best financing tool available,\u201d Walker said. If it really pains you to see them assume debt, remember you can plan now to help them pay it off once they\u2019ve graduated, she noted. Other borrowing options Beyond Stafford loans, there are other borrowing options, but they all come with big caveats: Private student loans: Some students may also take out a private student loan, which doesn\u2019t provide any of the flexible repayment protections they have with federal loans, and could come with a much higher interest rate. But if your child doesn\u2019t have a credit history, you will need to cosign the loan. So you should think about whether you can assume the risks of repaying that money if your child can\u2019t pay it off, especially if the loan you choose doesn\u2019t allow you to defer payment until your child graduates. Parental loans: Parents can also take out a federal Direct PLUS loan. But Joseph Bogardus, a certified financial planner who specializes in college cost planning, is not a big fan because of its high fees (over 4% of the loan amount), the fact that there is no real break on the interest rate (currently 8.05%) and parents may have to start repaying it while the student is in school, unless they request a deferment. As he put it, \u201cIf you can\u2019t afford to pay $500 a month now, what makes you think you\u2019ll be able to pay $1,000 a month later?\u201d Your 401(k): Taking a withdrawal from your retirement savings may be tempting, but it\u2019s never a great idea. No one is going to fund your retirement if you don\u2019t. But if you are thinking of using some retirement money, make sure to first directly roll over the amount from your 401(k) into an IRA. You will have to pay income taxes on the money, but if you\u2019re under 59-1/2 you will not be hit with a 10% early withdrawal penalty in an IRA if you use the money for qualified educational expenses, Bogardus said. Your credit card: A bad idea. Skip to the next options. The average credit card rate is north of 20%.\u00a0And if you can\u2019t pay off a large sum right away or you can only make the minimum payments due every month, you risk never getting out of that debt cycle. Home equity line of credit: If you\u2019re in a real pinch for your child\u2019s freshman year, and you have substantial equity in your home, Walker said, you might consider an interest-only home equity line of credit as a short-term cash-flow option. \u201cThat\u2019s cash-flow friendly while your child is in college,\u201d Walker said. \u201cYou\u2019re renting money on the cheap to buy time to figure out how you\u2019ll do this.\u201d So, say you take out a $20,000 interest-only HELOC at 8%. That means you\u2019ll only have to pay roughly $133 a month in interest, or $1,600 for the year. You will, however, have to pay the principal back after a given term \u2014 typically 10 years. And if you can\u2019t do so in full, you will have to pay interest and principal on the remaining balance until it\u2019s paid off. Redirect current spending and savings Even smaller measures can help somewhat in closing the funding gap if you\u2019re looking to raise some cash between now and the fall. Quantify how much a teenager at home costs: Walker said parents often overlook the expense of having their children under the same roof. She recommends evaluating how much your college-bound student costs you while they are at home. Think food, gas, entertainment, incidentals, etc. That\u2019s money you\u2019ll be able to redirect toward college costs when they leave home. Redirect discretionary income to savings: During the few months before the bill for the first semester comes due, temporarily cut back on your discretionary spending (e.g., travel and entertainment) and redirect that money into a high-yield savings account. Temporarily pause or reduce some retirement contributions: It\u2019s not optimal, but if you feel you\u2019re doing okay in terms of your retirement savings, you might temporarily redirect the money from your paycheck that would have gone into your 401(k) or IRA for the next three months and put it into the college kitty instead. But, Bogardus cautioned, \u201cYou don\u2019t want it to be a crutch. Think of the oxygen mask analogy: When doing this, parents should be in a good position first for their own future, then concern themselves with their student\u2019s college costs.\u201d Be honest about what you can afford College is among the biggest financial investments parents and their children will ever make. Ideally, key questions like \u201cHow much can we afford?\u201d should be raised no later than when your child is a sophomore in high school, at which point you can better set expectations of the kind of school you (and they) can afford, Walker said. So if you find yourself in a bind with your first-born this summer, you can at least be better prepared when your second child starts thinking about college. You both should take a hard look at different colleges\u2019 costs, Walker suggested, and ask: Is a Bachelor\u2019s degree from a school that costs two to three times as much as another really going to be worth two to three times as much when the child graduates? Also, Bogardus suggests checking to see if your state offers a tuition aid plan or subsidized loan rates for educational expenses. For instance, he said, see if your state has a program that offers a year or two of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to the state university from which your child could earn their degree.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/success/college-tuition-payment-options/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can \u201clisten\u201d to people\u2019s questions and converse in real time. \u201cShellie\u201d can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while \u201cArif\u201d is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_business_airline-credit-card-points-scheme", "text": "If you use a points-and-rewards credit card offered by an airline in partnership with a big bank, how much are the points you\u2019ve accrued worth in dollars? And how much do you need to spend to get the best rewards? If you\u2019re not sure, you\u2019re probably not alone. The terms and conditions of such card programs can be confusing and in some instances they can be changed at any time. Those were two of the issues discussed at a joint hearing held Thursday by the Department of Transportation and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in an effort to examine ways to improve\u00a0consumers\u2019 experience with \u2014 and financial return from \u2014 the popular programs that can generate huge revenue for large airlines. \u201cFor many families looking to finance a trip or a vacation, those [credit card] benefits are really valuable. \u2026 It\u2019s almost seen as savings \u2013 something in the bank that you will be able to spend,\u201d said Rohit Chopra, CFPB\u2019s director. \u201c[But] our review of all the fine print suggests that credit card companies and airlines have the power to quickly and dramatically devalue those points by making it more challenging to redeem them. \u2026 This creates confusion over the true value of the points and raises some questions about fairness.\u201d In some instances, Chopra added, consumers may pay fees for rewards cards \u201cwithout a clear option to get a refund\u201d when benefits get stripped away. Also raised at the hearing was concern for consumers who use rewards cards to carry revolving debt. \u201cConsumers with revolving debts on average pay far more in interest and fees than they get back in rewards,\u201d according to a CFPB report released Thursday. The hearing featured Chopra and Secretary of Transportation Peter Buttigieg, as well as a panel of consumer advocates and representatives from a few small airlines, a small credit union and a small bank. No one from the major airlines or the top 10 credit card issuing banks was present, although many had been invited, according to CFPB and DOT officials. Before the hearing started, however, Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association, put out a statement. \u201cThe credit card market in the U.S. is highly competitive, and consumers have hundreds of card issuers and thousands of card reward programs to choose from\u201d Nichols said, citing a Morning Consult survey that indicated 80% of credit card users have at least one credit card offering rewards and that the vast majority say they value them. Nichols also cited a bill in Congress that has been strongly opposed by banks, which aims to lower so-called \u201cinterchange fees,\u201d which is revenue that banks make on credit card transactions. Such a drop in revenue, banks argue, could jeopardize the availability of rewards programs. After the hearing, Jaret Seiberg, a financial services analyst for TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a note that he expects the reason for the event is \u201cbuilding the foundation for the CFPB to force changes to airline reward credit cards by ensuring already earned miles cannot be devalued and by preventing airline miles from expiring.\u201d But, Seiberg added, \u201cOur expectation remains that the ultimate outcome here is likely tied to the election. We see the CFPB and DOT moving forward if President Biden wins while it is less likely that Trump-controlled agencies would act.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/business/airline-credit-card-points-scheme/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_02_28_tech_brain-implant-als-patient-bci", "text": "Staring at a computer screen, Mark focuses deeply, his\u202farms resting by his side. His right index finger trembles ever so slightly on top of a pillow, and then an alert rings out from the screen in front of him, a message to a caregiver that he needs assistance. Without ever clicking a mouse or touching a screen, Mark selected this command on his computer simply using signals from his brain. Mark, whom CNN agreed to identify using only his first name for privacy reasons, has an implant inside his brain that is translating his neural activity to commands on a computer. Mark is only the 10th person in the world implanted with this particular type of brain-computer interface, or BCI. He\u2019s participating in a human trial with a company called Synchron and underwent the procedure in August, after being diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis \u2013 sometimes called ALS or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease \u2013 in 2021. The hope is that the technology in Mark\u2019s brain could assist him and others like him who are losing their motor function. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for a piece of technology to help someone that will not be able to help themselves otherwise,\u201d Mark told CNN. Excitement around the potential for BCI technology has mounted over the past year, propelled in part by high-profile support from billionaire Elon Musk via his company Neuralink, as well as the recent publication of several promising studies from other players in the growing field. But the technology is far from mainstream, and efforts to commercialize it remain fraught with regulatory hurdles, ethics and privacy concerns. And the emerging technology itself faces numerous limitations. In other words, these procedures won\u2019t be coming to your local doctor\u2019s office anytime soon. Still, Mark says the opportunity to be at the forefront of testing this technology that could help others was important to him. Knowing that there is no cure for ALS, Mark says, signing up for the trial felt like a \u201cno-brainer\u201d to him. \u201cI figured I had two choices: I could wallow in self-pity, or I could pick myself up by the bootstraps and do what I could to help,\u201d Mark said. Creating a dictionary of the mind Relaxed and dressed in a light teal sweater, Mark offers no obvious physical indications that he has a BCI. He says he doesn\u2019t notice it, either. \u201cI have no sensation in my brain, that there\u2019s something there,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in an interview. Mark has two small scars, one on his right chest and one on his neck, but  no other visible indicators of a BCI. Synchron\u2019s brain implant, the one Mark has, is called a Stentrode and consists of a stent with electrode sensors that can detect electrical brain activity. Synchron patented the Stentrode, and the company was the first to receive approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to begin human trials for permanently implantable BCIs. Like a normal stent, it doesn\u2019t require open brain surgery. Instead, it\u2019s able to travel through the body\u2019s natural network of veins, so the entry point was Mark\u2019s jugular vein.\u202fHis surgeon threaded the device through the blood vessels all the way to the top of his brain, where it sits in the sagittal sinus, one of the brain\u2019s main veins, cradled in the motor cortex, the part of the brain responsible for movement. Whether it\u2019s shaking hands or taking a step, every action a person does is associated with a specific electrical signature from their brainwaves. The Stentrode learns to recognize those electrical patterns and creates a personalized dictionary of movement. There may be a general electrical signature for different movements, but each person\u2019s will vary slightly, making the device highly personalized. When Mark thinks about a certain movement, like clicking somewhere on a computer screen, the Stentrode reads that brain signal and recognizes the intended movement. Then that message travels via a very thin cable to an internal transmitter, similar to a pacemaker, that was surgically implanted in his chest. So much data travels from Mark\u2019s brain to the transmitter that it has to be wired to a computer.\u00a0That external transmitter sits right above the internal transmitter and carries the signal from Mark\u2019s brain to the computer almost instantaneously. At the moment, Mark has to be wired to the computer to use the device. However, the goal is that the next-generation devices will eventually have a wireless process, so a patient would need only the Stentrode and the transmitter inside the chest. Coming to terms with an ALS diagnosis Mark first noticed that something wasn\u2019t quite right in 2020. He couldn\u2019t snap his fingers or make a pinching motion with his left hand; he also noticed some visible muscle atrophy.\u00a0\u201cAnd then I dropped a cup of coffee,\u201d he recalls. At age 63, Mark\u2019s diagnosis was official: He had ALS, a disease with which most people are only expected to live three to five years after symptoms develop. \u201cIt was a hard pill to swallow,\u201d he admits. \u201cI still consider myself young.\u201d He had a job he loved and was going to retire soon. He also has a family, including two daughters and one granddaughter. Despite the diagnosis and weakness in his arm, Mark continued to work at his job at a wholesale floral company. Lifting buckets of water and boxes of flowers, however, soon became too difficult. Then driving became difficult. By December 2022, he stopped driving altogether. There was an emotional toll to ALS too as Mark started to lose his independence. \u201cI lived alone for 13 years, so I was used to doing everything by myself,\u201d he said. He eventually moved in with his brother and his brother\u2019s family. Today, his voice is strong, and he can still walk, but he says he has to use a foot-controlled feeder to eat because of the loss of strength in his arms. Mark is still able to make some very limited movements with his hands, but he\u2019s lost most of the dexterity in his fingers \u2013 meaning he can\u2019t pick up a pencil or scroll on his phone. Mark hopes the BCI can help him with tasks like accessing his phone. But Mark didn\u2019t lose hope that he could still find a way to help others. He enrolled in a drug trial, and when that ended, he immediately asked his doctor what else he could do that was \u201cnew and exciting.\u201d That\u2019s when he found himself in this feasibility trial with Synchron and the BCI. After his device was implanted in August, his ability to use his BCI wasn\u2019t immediate, something that frustrated him. It took about two months for his recovery, including waiting for the swelling from the pacemaker-like device to go down, before the Synchron team could even turn the implant on. But he remembers the first time it did work. \u201cThere was a few cheers,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe\u2019d been trying and trying, and it was not working so good, and then it finally worked.\u201d For the past three months, Mark has been working with Maria Nardozzi, an occupational therapist from Synchron. As he masters each task, he builds up that dictionary of movement that the device uses to read his brainwaves and translate them into actions on the computer. So far, Mark has mastered a program that allows him to send a health notification or a pain report to his provider if needed. His immediate goals are to be able to control his Alexa and turn on Netflix, as well as to learn how to text. \u201cText messaging is a really critical element of how we communicate with our family and friends now,\u201d said Stentrode developer Dr. Tom Oxley, the CEO of Synchron. \u201cSo that\u2019s usually what people mostly want back.\u201d Oxley said he has seen some patients with stentrodes able to type between five and 10 words per minute already, a notable achievement if you consider that most people can text between five and 20 words per minute. Mark has also used the device to play a \u201cPong\u201d-like table tennis video game. He describes the feeling of using the device as his brainwaves\u00a0contracting and then relaxing. Each move he wants to make on the computer has a focused, intentional thought. If he doesn\u2019t want the bar to move, he must relax. The process of training the device takes patience, Mark said, but he\u2019s excited to help his doctors and the Synchron team learn along with him. \u201cSometimes it doesn\u2019t work like we want,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of being involved in a study is we\u2019re here to learn, we\u2019re here to further the technology.\u201d The rise and race for BCI technology Although still far from mainstream, the potential of BCI technology has spurred the emergence of a handful of companies racing to develop this futuristic health tech. Two separate studies published in the journal Nature in August showed how brain implants using artificial intelligence technology empowered paralyzed patients to communicate by translating neural signals into text or speech via an avatar at a speed not previously achieved by this type of technology. And investors are showing strong appetite for the neurotech startups and companies working in the BCI arena. Synchron has raised about $145 million since its inception, the company said in a statement in December 2022. Musk\u2019s Neuralink has raised more than $323 million, according to a regulatory filing last year with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cThey\u2019re all a bit different,\u201d Oxley, the neurologist and CEO of Synchron, told CNN of the major players in the BCI field right now. Musk, especially, has \u201cshined a big light onto the field\u201d with his involvement in Neuralink, Oxley said. Ultimately, Oxley added, \u201ccompetition is good.\u201d As a result, he said, we will probably see many \u201cdifferent types of technologies come through for different use cases.\u201d As the race to commercialize BCI heats up, policymakers are taking notice. A United Nations body convened a conference with politicians and stakeholders in July at UNESCO\u2019s Paris headquarters to discuss the ethics of the emerging neurotechnology. The conference concluded with calls for a comprehensive framework to harness the potential and address the risks. \u201cNeurotechnology is advancing at warp speed,\u201d Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, said at the event. \u201cThis progress is a cause for celebration \u2013 and a reason for caution. We must safeguard ethical standards and ensure the full protection of human rights.\u201d Musk\u2019s involvement has fueled controversy. The billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has made bold claims about BCI\u2019s potential to solve a range of complex problems. Neuralink made international headlines this year when Musk said in a post on X that the company had implanted a chip in a human brain \u2013 though he did not share many other details.\u00a0Earlier this month, Musk also said Neuralink\u2019s first human trial participant\u00a0can control a computer mouse\u00a0with their brain.\u00a0Neuralink received FDA clearance for human clinical trials in May. Neuralink came under fire in 2022 for its treatment of monkeys during testing. The company acknowledged that a monkey died during an attempt to get the animal to play a video game like \u201cPong.\u201d Current and former employees of Neuralink at the time accused the company of rushing to market, according to Reuters, resulting in careless animal deaths. Hope for the future and a chance for a full life now There are still a lot of things Mark can do on his own. He can walk and speak and retains some movement in his limbs. But in the few years since his ALS diagnosis, Mark says, he has already noticed a loss in dexterity. The BCI provides Mark with hope that he can make a difference for other people in the future and a chance to continue living a full life now. If he wants to access Audible, his favorite app, he has to have someone lay his phone flat in front of him so he can select the app. He hopes that eventually, his implant can help him have easier access to his audiobooks and help with other daily tasks, even control his robotic feeder, which he currently powers with his foot. \u201cThis, to me, is an opportunity to be able to do those tasks without the use of my arm,\u201d he said. Ultimately, Mark said, he hopes that his involvement in this study will also provide hope for others. He said this was his main reason for participating in the trial. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to maybe help myself,\u201d Mark said. \u201cBut more importantly, I think, to help other individuals.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/02/28/tech/brain-implant-als-patient-bci/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

(As an aside, it really holds up \u2014 10/10, no notes.) Early in the plot, when the guests are discussing their impressions of the park, Jeff Goldblum\u2019s character (also 10/10, just perfect) launches into a speech so prescient you could sub out all the dinosaur stuff and map it onto the modern debate around artificial intelligence. \u201cDon\u2019t you see the danger, John, inherent in what you\u2019re doing here? Genetic power is the most awesome force the planet\u2019s ever seen, but you wield it like a kid that\u2019s found his dad\u2019s gun \u2026 You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now you\u2019re selling it.\u201d And then comes the line that later launched a thousand memes: \u201cYour scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn\u2019t stop to think if they should.\u201d Naturally, the skeptic of the group is dismissed as a Luddite and the movie carries on. (Spoiler alert: The Luddite was right!) AI skeptics \u2014 who are legion, and not necessarily part of the fringe tin foil hat crowd \u2014 are begging Silicon Valley to take a beat before unleashing AI to the world. But tech companies, faced with the most powerful computing innovation in a generation, are running around like kids who just found their dad\u2019s gun. See here: Apple and Google \u2014 which, to be sure, deserve a lot of credit for the innovations they\u2019ve brought to the world \u2014 have recently latched on to AI-powered features to help sell their newest tablets and smartphones. After all, throwing AI into your pitch deck is a surefire way to signal to shareholders that you\u2019re on the cutting edge, which helps distract from the fact that your company hasn\u2019t actually produced any significant proprietary tech in years. In marketing those new devices, though, Apple and Google have lost the plot. Apple\u2019s new iPad advertisement made headlines for all the wrong reasons this week. The spot depicts a massive industrial hydraulic press slowly crushing\u00a0a collection of objects that represent the human creative experience: There\u2019s a piano, a record player blasting Sonny & Cher\u2019s 1972 hit \u201cAll I Ever Need Is You,\u201d cans of paint, books, a Space Invaders arcade console, a trumpet. The music bounces along as the machine switches on and smashes it all down. Then, the big reveal: It\u2019s all contained in Apple\u2019s new iPad, its thinnest and most powerful ever, thanks to its brand new AI chip. The outrage online came fast and furious. \u201cIt is the most honest metaphor for what tech companies do to \u2026 artists, musicians, creators, writers, filmmakers: squeeze them, use them, not pay well, take everything then say it\u2019s all created by them,\u201d filmmaker Asif Kapadia wrote on X. \u201cIf you thought THIS IPad ad was weird, you should have seen the first cut where they lined up all your favorite characters and shot them,\u201d quipped actor and producer Luke Barnett. Apple issued a rare apology for the ad on Thursday, telling AdAge that \u201cour goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we\u2019re sorry.\u201d Earlier in the week, CEO Tim Cook said Apple\u2019s \u201coutrageously powerful\u201d M4 chip will power the company\u2019s new AI tools. In other words: Check it out, Wall Street! People\u00a0aren\u2019t buying our stuff as much\u00a0any more but just wait until we add bots! Meanwhile, is anyone else getting inundated with Google\u2019s Pixel ads, which show people giddily using the smartphone\u2019s AI photo-editing software to deceive their online followers? In those ads, a guy who can\u2019t dunk a basketball on his own uses a trampoline to get to the rim, and then edits out the trampoline. An imperfect group selfie gets everyone\u2019s best angle and creates a composite image of a moment that never happened. A dad tosses his kid up playfully in the air, and then edits the image to seem, for reasons I still don\u2019t understand, as if the kid went several inches higher into the air. This is Google going, \u201clook what we can do!\u201d without any reflection on how pointless it all is. It is, at best, distortion for distortion\u2019s sake. At worst, it\u2019s distortion for the sake of conditioning regular people to be cool with the idea of visual misinformation. Smartphones and tablets were invented to enhance our lived experience, to make it easier to leave the house and go to the beach and meet up with friends \u2014 just a good camera-computer combo that fits in your pocket. Theoretically, our phones and tablets will become even more useful with AI, serving as virtual assistants that can do all the boring stuff we don\u2019t want to, like summarizing all your new emails and filtering out junk. There\u2019s a world in the not too distant future, according to AI proponents, where you can simply tell Siri or Google \u201corder my usual breakfast from the coffee shop near the office, I\u2019ll be there in 10 minutes to pick it up,\u201d and the bot will do just that. We\u2019re not there yet, however. And so far, the consumer applications for AI are simultaneously underwhelming and dystopian. Distorted images may be harmless social media fodder, until they become propaganda spread by bad actors. Apple is expected to announce its own ChatGPT-like tools that could be a game changer for your internet searches. But generative AI bots are also prone to give wrong answers and experience hallucinations, and no one seems to know what happens when the bots run out of human-generated data to learn from and start hoovering up their own artificial texts like a snake eating its own tail. The Jeff Goldblums of the AI debate \u2014 who include some of the industry\u2019s own pioneers \u2014 are not necessarily saying we have to smother AI and pretend it never existed. Most of them are just your friendly neighborhood skeptic, walking around going, \u201chey, should we really do that?\u201d Clearly, we weren\u2019t invited to Apple\u2019s or Google\u2019s marketing meetings.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/business/ai-dystopia-silicon-valley-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_10_business_apple-labor-unions-stores-retail-strike", "text": "Apple faces plenty of challenges this year including regulatory scrutiny in Washington, sluggish sales in China and a competitive landscape in AI. Now, its leaders also have to contend with labor unrest. Apple store workers in Towson, Maryland, made history in June 2022 when they voted to form the first union at one of the tech giant\u2019s sleek US stores. Since 2023, the worker group outside of Baltimore has been in contract negotiations with Apple management. Now, workers are weighing a strike. Saying management has yet to meet their core demands, the Maryland workers are holding a strike authorization vote on Saturday, one of the strongest labor actions taken against the Big Tech company yet. And it\u2019s far from the only labor challenge Apple is battling in the US. Employees in New Jersey are holding a union election this weekend. In addition, the National Labor Relations Board this week upheld a decision alleging Apple\u2019s union-busting tactics in New York City. The company also has unfair labor practice complaints against it in front of labor judges right now (Apple denies these allegations). The labor wave that has hit Apple retail stores echoes the mass organizing that began at other influential companies in the United States, such as Starbucks and Amazon. As Apple grew to become the world\u2019s first $3 trillion company, a tight labor market coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic exposed labor conditions and inequalities front-facing workers in places such as stores and warehouses faced. \u201cIt speaks to a growing frustration among workers and also a contagion in labor activity, which is when one group of workers stands up and inspires others,\u201d Kate Bronfenbrenner, the Director of Labor Education Research at Cornell\u2019s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said. So far, workers at two Apple store locations \u2013 Towson, Maryland and Oklahoma City \u2013 have voted to unionize. But the union vote in New Jersey this weekend, along with other efforts across the country, could just be the beginning. Apple is a high profile company \u2013 and many, many Americans have at least one Apple product. \u201cThis whole segment of the economy that didn\u2019t have a lot of activity, suddenly has activity. The Apple workers (possibly) going on strike is going to be a spark for other workers,\u201d Bronfenbrenner said. \u201cAt Apple we work hard to provide an excellent experience for our retail team members and empower them to deliver exceptional service for our customers. We deeply value our team members and we\u2019re proud to provide them with industry leading compensation and exceptional benefits. As always, we will engage with the union representing our team in Towson respectfully and in good faith,\u201d an Apple spokesperson said in an emailed statement to CNN. A possible strike The Maryland workers are considering a strike because after over a year of negotiations, management had yet to come up with solutions to core issues such as \u201cwork-life balance, unpredictable scheduling practices that disrupt personal lives, and wages that do not reflect the cost of living in the area,\u201d a release by the union said. A strike sanction vote doesn\u2019t mean the store is going on strike. It\u2019s one step of a longer process that ends with a final strike authorization vote. The workers at the Maryland Apple store are members of the\u00a0International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Coalition of Organized Retail Employees (IAM COTE). \u201cThis strike sanction vote sends a strong message that the workers want Apple to recognize the need for an equitable and respectful work environment for all its employees,\u201d\u00a0IAM District 4 Directing Business Representative Jay Wadleigh said in a statement. The Maryland store has an ongoing complaint filed against Apple, which alleges the company provided improved health and education benefits to non-union employees and not the unionized employees. Bronfenbrenner said a big motivation behind organizing is the gap between corporate profits in America\u2019s biggest companies \u2013 such as Apple, Amazon and Google \u2013 and worker wages and benefits, especially for workers in retail stores or warehouses. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of anger. And the corporations like Apple have made huge profits while the workers feel like their wages have stagnated,\u201d Bronfenbrenner said. Union drives in full swing Apple, like other big companies, is cracking down on union activities. The NLRB found that Apple went too far in trying to crack down on a union drive in New York City. The NLRB\u00a0ruled this month that Apple unlawfully interrogated employees and confiscated and prohibited union flyers while allowing non-union materials at the World Trade Center location in 2022. The NLRB held up the US Labor Board judge\u2019s decision from last year \u2013 which was the first time a labor judge ruled against Apple. The affirmation from the NLRB is a win for labor organizers. But across the river in New Jersey, there is a union election for employees in Short Hills, a New York City suburb. There are other unfair labor practice complaints against Apple before labor judges at the moment. Similar to New York City, workers in Atlanta issued a complaint in 2022 alleging Apple illegally interrogated employees about union support and tried to convince them not to join one. The labor action is not just taking place at Apple\u2019s front-facing retail stores. In its Cupertino, California, headquarters, a decision is pending for a complaint that alleged Apple illegally fired, disciplined, threatened and interrogated an employee for \u201cengaging in protected concerted activity.\u201d Big Tech, traditionally seen as a prestigious and secure field, has been hit with mass layoffs. These workers \u201ctend to be higher paid positions and more technological positions. And those are workers that traditionally were not seen as organizing,\u201d Bronfenbrenner said. In a statement regarding the open complaints, Apple said \u201cWe strongly deny these claims and look forward to providing the full set of facts to the NLRB.\u201d CNN\u2019s Catherine Thorbecke contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/business/apple-labor-unions-stores-retail-strike/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_investing_trump-media-insider-trading", "text": "An investor in the shell company that merged with Trump Media was found guilty on Thursday of insider trading linked to that blockbuster deal, according to federal prosecutors. Bruce Garelick, who served as a director at the shell company, was\u00a0accused of using secret knowledge\u00a0of the looming deal with Trump Media to trade and tip off others. Those trades paid off as shares of the shell company, Digital World Acquisition Corporation (DWAC), spiked in October 2021 on news of the\u00a0blockbuster deal\u00a0to bring Truth Social owner Trump Media (DJT) public. \u201cAs a unanimous jury has just found, Garelick blatantly violated the law by using the information that he obtained as an insider at DWAC to trade and tip others,\u201d Damian Williams, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a\u00a0statement. \u201cGarelick\u2019s federal conviction is yet another stark reminder that insider trading is always a losing bet.\u201d Garelick was among three men who were arrested and charged last June in the insider trading case. The other two, Florida venture capitalist Michael Shvartsman and his brother Gerald Shvartsman,\u00a0pleaded guilty last month\u00a0to participating in the insider trading scheme. Prosecutors have not alleged that former President Donald Trump, the chairman and leading shareholder of Trump Media, had any involvement in the scheme. Garelick used \u201cvaluable material non-public information\u201d about Digital World\u2019s merger plan to \u201cmake lucrative trades,\u201d according to the June indictment. The indictment alleged that Garelick attended board meetings in September and October 2021 about the timing of a merger agreement with Trump Media, which also included discussion of deal terms and a likely closing date. Garelick then allegedly passed that non-public information on to Michael and Gerald Shvartsman, who proceeded to buy Digital World securities. Beyond their own purchases, prosecutors say Garelick and his co-defendants tipped off friends and colleagues who also bought securities in Digital World before the Trump Media deal was announced publicly. After years of delay, Trump Media finally completed its merger with Digital World in late March, paving the way for the company to publicly trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol \u201cDJT.\u201d Even rhough Trump Media generates little revenue and Truth Social remains a tiny player in social media, the company has achieved a massive valuation that experts say makes little sense. Trump is the dominant shareholder, with a total of 114.75 million shares after he received additional shares through a bonus late last month. At current prices, that stake is worth about $6.2 billion.

{"id": "2024_05_10_cars_hyundai-kia-auto-theft-stolen-cars", "text": "Two Hyundai models and one Kia were the three most-stolen vehicles last year, according to a report from the National Insurance Crime Bureau. Hyundai Elantra compact cars were stolen more than 48,000 times last year while Hyundai Sonata sedans were stolen almost 43,000 times, according to the report. Kia Optima sedans were stolen more than 30,000 times according to the report, which only counted police-reported thefts. These theft numbers far outstripped those of the fourth most stolen model, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 pickup, one of the best-selling vehicles in America. Silverado pickups were stolen about 24,000 times, according to the report. In all, six of the top 10 most-stolen vehicles in America last year were Hyundai and Kia models. The list included the Kia Soul, Kia Forte, and Kia Sportage. Other vehicles on the list were the Honda Accord, Honda Civic and the Ford F-150 pickup. The NICB reports raw numbers of police-reported thefts that are gathered through the National Crime Information Center. The numbers are not adjusted for the population of a given model on the road so, to a certain extent, some vehicles may be more commonly stolen simply because there are more of them available to steal. Why Hyundai and Kia cars are top targets By the first half of 2023, thefts of older Hyundai and Kia models had increased by 1,000% since 2020, according to a report by the Highway Loss Data Institute early this year. Certain older Hyundai and Kia models made before 2023 are particularly vulnerable to car thieves. Less expensive versions of vehicles such as those cars equipped with turn-key ignitions \u2014 as opposed to cars that only require a button press to start \u2013 are roughly twice as likely to be stolen as other vehicles of a similar age, according to the HLDI. These vehicles can lack some of the basic auto theft prevention technologies, such as electronic immobilizers, included in most other vehicles even in those years, according to the HLDI. Electronic immobilizers rely on a computer chip in the car and another in the key that communicate to confirm that the key is authentic and belongs to that vehicle. Techniques to steal these cars spread through social media channels. As theft claims for Hyundai and Kia vehicles have incrased since 2020, \u201cvandalism\u201d insurance claims on them have also gone up, according HLDI data. That\u2019s presumably a result of these models being targeted for theft but left damaged when some attempts fail, according to HLDI. Hyundai and Kia operate as separate companies in the United States, but Hyundai Motor Group owns a large stake in Kia, and various Hyundai and Kia models share much of their engineering. More recent models from these automakers are less vulnerable to theft. Earlier this year, Hyundai and Kia agreed to a\u00a0$200 million settlement\u00a0with as many as 9 million vehicle owners to settle claims that the automakers didn\u2019t do enough to make the vehicles secure. Along with payments for stolen and damaged vehicles, the settlement also included installation of anti-theft software and the costs of other theft-preventative measures. \u201cIn response to this situation, Kia continues\u00a0to\u00a0take\u00a0comprehensive\u00a0action\u00a0to enhance the security of our vehicles in an effort to prevent criminals from using methods of theft popularized on social media to break the law and steal or attempt to steal certain vehicle\u00a0models,\u201d Kia spokesman James Bell said in an emailed statement. More than 1.1 million Kia vehicles nationwide have had anti-theft software installed, according to Kia. The company is also providing free steering wheel locks for vehicles that are not able to accept the anti-theft software. Hyundai said it has retroactively added various anti-theft measures on 1.3 million of its vehicles.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/cars/hyundai-kia-auto-theft-stolen-cars/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_07_cars_fender-benders-high-tech-car-repairs", "text": "Auto body repair was a pretty straightforward business not that long ago. When metal got bent in a crash, someone needed to unbend it. It was a craft. These days, it\u2019s high-tech. Virtually every new vehicle sold in the last few years has sensors and cameras, including radar and sonar, throughout the body of the vehicle. Those sensors dot the body of a car like little round buttons. Sometimes shiny black boxes are also embedded in the grille and what look like camera lenses are mounted behind the windshield up high near the rearview mirror. These have made the repair process more complex because, unlike a smashed fender, a sensor or camera can\u2019t just be bolted or welded back on. To work, they need to be carefully and precisely aligned. It\u2019s changed the process of collision repair a lot. \u201cThe change that we\u2019ve seen in the last five years is greater than we\u2019ve seen, probably, in the last five decades,\u201d said Todd Dillender, chief operating officer of Caliber Collision, one of the biggest auto body repair companies in the United States with more than 1,700 locations across 41 states. According to a study by the consumer automotive group AAA, fixing sensors and cameras now accounts for more than a third of the post-crash repair costs in a new vehicle. It\u2019s important to note that no one, including AAA, recommends not getting these features because of repair costs. Systems like automatic emergency braking, blind spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alerts can reduce your chances of getting in a crash in the first place. That\u2019s one reason automatic emergency braking is now nearly universal on new cars and, in a few years, will be required in the United States. Besides avoiding the need for repairs by reducing crashes, they also help prevent injury to vehicle occupants and pedestrians which is, after all, far more important than a dented fender. Some of these systems can cut crash rates in half, said Greg Brannon, director of automotive engineering at AAA. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to prevent everything,\u201d said Brannon, \u201cAnd when you are in a crash, there are additional costs so it\u2019s sort of the old \u2018there\u2019s no free ride\u2019 when it comes to these things.\u201d These sensors and cameras can interact with a vehicle\u2019s brakes and, sometimes, steering so that, in an emergency, the car will stop or swerve back into its lane. Most commonly, they set off warning tones, lights and graphics on the vehicle\u2019s internal screens to warn a driver of a car, pedestrian or object that presents a potential hazard. In a crash, these sensors and cameras can be damaged or just knocked out of alignment. In either case the sensor will be useless or can cause systems to behave erratically. \u201cYou\u2019re changing the way the sensor looks out in the world,\u201d said Hami Ebrahimi, chief commercial officer at Caliber. Even a tiny misalignment can result in a big difference in where another vehicle or obstacle is perceived to be. Every car is different While these sensors and cameras may need to be aligned and recalibrated following any collision, what makes the task harder is that every car manufacturer can have a different process for making the repair. Even different models can have different methods and can require different equipment. \u201cEven within the same manufacturer, sometimes even the same model, the recalibration procedures are different depending on the systems in the car and what type of system that specific vehicle has,\u201d Ebrahimi said. Some vehicles require \u201cdynamic calibration,\u201d which means, once the sensors and cameras are back in place, a driver needs to take the vehicle out on real roads for testing. With proper equipment attached the car can, essentially, recalibrate itself as it watches lane lines and other markers. It requires the car to be driven for a set distance at a certain speed but weather and traffic can create problems. \u201cIf you\u2019re in Chicago or L.A., good luck getting to that speed,\u201d said Ebrahimi \u201dor if you\u2019re in Seattle or Chicago or New York, with snow, good luck picking up all the road markings.\u201d More commonly, vehicles need \u201cstatic calibration,\u201d which can be done using machinery inside a closed workshop with a flat, level floor. Special targets are set up around the vehicle at set distances according to instructions from the vehicle manufacturer. \u201cThe car [views] those targets at those specific distances to recalibrate the world into the car\u2019s computer,\u201d Ebrahimi said. Not just the cost of materials These kinds of repairs also demand buildings with open space that meet requirements including specific colors and lighting. And it requires special training for employees to perform these sorts of recalibrations, he said. With a rapidly changing industry, qualified auto body repair technicians are in short supply, just as they are in the engine repair business. That\u2019s also led to upward pressure on pay in the industry as technicians have to be highly qualified and educated, Dillender said. That\u2019s good for people who work in the industry, of course, but tougher for those who pay, and for the insurance companies who, in turn, pay for the repairs. Even within the insurance industry itself, the job of a claims adjuster has gotten much more complicated, said Mike Bundra, director of Allstate\u2019s auto repair network. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested heavily into training and development, more than we ever have,\u201d he said. Claim adjustors, who often come from the collision repair industry themselves, need to understand all the nuances involved in repairing these automated systems and sensors. \u201cThose annual trainings are more quarterly and \u2018as needed,\u2019 really, right now,\u201d said Bundra.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/cars/fender-benders-high-tech-car-repairs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_tech_meta-child-safety-investigation-arrests-new-mexico", "text": "An investigation by the New Mexico Attorney General into the potential dangers of Meta\u2019s platforms has resulted in the arrests of three men charged with attempted sexual abuse of children. The arrests came after a months-long investigation by the attorney general\u2019s office into the risks of sexual exploitation of children on Facebook and Instagram. That investigation also formed the basis of a lawsuit against Meta, filed in December, accusing the tech giant of creating a \u201cbreeding ground\u201d for child predators. Meta has pushed back against the claims in the lawsuit and says it offers dozens of safety tools for children and parents. As part of the investigation, the attorney general\u2019s office created multiple fake Facebook and Instagram profiles posing as children, which the suit alleges were served sexually suggestive content and, in some cases, were urged by other users to send pornographic content of themselves. The fake child accounts were also allegedly contacted and solicited for sex by the three New Mexico adult men whose arrests were announced by the attorney general on Wednesday. Two of the three men were arrested at a motel, where they allegedly believed they would be meeting up with a 12-year-old girl, based on their conversations with the decoy accounts. \u201cThis is (Meta CEO) Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s fault,\u201d New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said in a press conference announcing the arrests Wednesday. \u201cThis is the fault of a company that has extraordinary resources at its disposal and has chosen time and again to place profits over the interests of children.\u201d A Meta spokesperson told CNN that \u201cchild exploitation is a horrific crime and we\u2019ve spent years building technology to combat it and to support law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting the criminals behind it.\u201d \u201cThis is an ongoing fight, where determined criminals evolve their tactics across platforms to try and evade protections,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe use sophisticated technology, hire child safety experts, report content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and share information and tools with other companies and non-profits to help root out predators across the many platforms they use.\u201d News of the arrests could add to the growing scrutiny that Meta \u2013 like other social media companies \u2013 faces over the safety of young users on its platforms. Lawmakers, parents and online safety advocates, as well as several separate lawsuits, have raised concerns about the impact of Meta\u2019s platforms on teens\u2019 mental health, body image and overall wellbeing. In January, Zuckerberg apologized to families who said their children had been harmed by using social media during a Senate committee hearing about online youth safety. In January \u2014 after Torrez\u2019s lawsuit was filed and ahead of the Senate hearing \u2014 Meta rolled out\u00a0additional youth safety features, including\u00a0updating teens\u2019 default privacy settings\u00a0to restrict anyone they don\u2019t follow from messaging them, including other teens. The move came after Meta in 2021\u00a0restricted adults\u00a0over age 19 from messaging teens who don\u2019t follow them. The company also said in December that it had launched technology to proactively detect and disable accounts displaying suspicious behaviors and that it formed a Child Safety Task Force. But Torrez said during Wednesday\u2019s press conference that the arrests underscore the ongoing, real-world risks to children from Meta\u2019s platforms. One of the New Mexico men arrested this week, 52-year-old Fernando Clyde, allegedly added one of the attorney general\u2019s fake child Facebook accounts as a friend and initiated a conversation in February. \u201cThroughout the conversation Fernando sent pictures of his genitals and spoke to her about having sex,\u201d a press release from the attorney general\u2019s office states. Clyde is charged with one count of child solicitation by electronic communication device of a child under 13 and one of attempted criminal sexual penetration of a minor. The second man, 29-year-old Marlon Kellywood, faces the same charges. Attorneys for Clyde and Kellywood could not immediately be reached for comment. The third man, 47-year-old Christopher Reynolds, was arrested and charged with one count of child solicitation by electronic communication device of a child under 13 after police were tipped off by a mother whose 11-year-old had allegedly received messages from him. Investigators then friended him from the fake child account, and Reynolds initiated a conversation and sent sexually explicit messages, according to the attorney general\u2019s office. Reynolds\u2019 attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \u201cThe decoy accounts with which these suspects engaged mirror the experience children can and are having on these platforms,\u201d Torrez said in a press release. He added that the investigation indicates \u201cthat using Meta\u2019s social media platforms not only endangers children in the virtual world but, more importantly, they are spaces that sexual predators actively use to hunt, groom and victimize children in the real world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/tech/meta-child-safety-investigation-arrests-new-mexico/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

The cyberattack on Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit network that includes 140 hospitals in 19 states, is also disrupting access to electronic health records, some phone systems and \u201cvarious systems utilized to order certain tests, procedures and medications,\u201d Ascension said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0distributed Thursday evening. The sprawling health care network, which also owns 40 senior living facilities, said that it would be using \u201cdowntime procedure for some time,\u201d because of the cyberattack. Downtime procedures are typically when health providers revert to backup processes, including paper records, that allow them to care for patients when computers are down. Four sources briefed on the investigation told CNN that Ascension suffered a ransomware attack, in which cybercriminals typically try to lock computers and steal data for extortion. Those sources said that the type of ransomware used in the hack is known as Black Basta, which hackers have used repeatedly to attack health care organizations in recent years. Black Basta, also the name of a broad criminal group that uses the ransomware, includes Russian-speakers, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. On Friday, the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a cyber threat sharing group for big health care providers worldwide,\u00a0published an advisory warning that hackers using Black Basta ransomware have \u201crecently accelerated attacks against the healthcare sector.\u201d That includes at least two health care organizations in Europe and the US that in the last month\u00a0have \u201csuffered severe operational disruptions\u201d because of Black Basta ransomware,\u201d the advisory said, without naming the health care organizations. News of the hack of Ascension broke\u00a0on Wednesday, and Ascension has in the last 24 hours followed a familiar playbook for many American organizations that have been assaulted by cybercriminals. Ascension has notified federal authorities of the incident, hired prominent US cybersecurity firm Mandiant to recover from the incident and shut down systems to try to keep the incident under control. Senior US officials have been in repeated contact with Ascension CEO Joseph Impicciche since the ransomware attack to understand how the hack might impact patient care, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. \u201cWe are actively supporting our ministries as they continue to provide safe, patient care with established downtime protocols and procedures, in which our workforce is well trained,\u201d Ascension said in its statement Thursday evening. It was not clear how many Ascension hospitals were sending ambulances to other locations because of the cyberattack. Ascension spokesperson Gene Ford did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment. It\u2019s only the latest major hacking incident that has hobbled a big US health care network and sent US officials scrambling to offer support. A February ransomware attack on Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of health care giant UnitedHealth Group, caused billing disruptions at pharmacies across the US and\u00a0threatened to put\u00a0some health providers out of business. A third of Americans may have had their personal data swept up in the hack, UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty\u00a0estimated\u00a0in testimony to Congress this month. UnitedHealth paid a $22 million ransom to the cybercriminals to try to protect patient data, Witty said. That Change Healthcare hack incensed US lawmakers and prompted questions across the federal government about the vulnerability of America\u2019s health care system to disruptive cyberattacks with cascading impacts \u2014\u00a0questions that the cyberattack on Ascension will do nothing to assuage.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/tech/cyberattack-ascension-ambulances-hospitals/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

The trade restriction list, known as the entity list, has been used aggressively by the United States to stem the flow of technology to\u00a0China\u00a0amid concerns Beijing could use it to bolster its military capabilities. Being added to the list makes it harder for US suppliers to ship to the targeted entities. The Biden administration on Thursday also added a handful of Chinese entities to the list for trying to obtain American items for making drones to be used by the Chinese military and others for shipping controlled items to Russia.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/business/china-spy-balloon-us-trade-restrictions-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_02_22_business_four-day-work-week-uk", "text": "One year after the conclusion of the world\u2019s biggest trial of a four-day work week,\u00a0a large majority of companies that took part were still allowing their employees to work a shorter week and more than half had made the change permanent. For six months between June and December 2022, workers at 61 organizations in the United Kingdom worked 80% of their usual hours \u2014 for the same pay \u2014 in exchange for promising to deliver 100% of their usual work. At least 89% of those firms were still operating the policy and at least 51% had made the four-day week permanent at the end of 2023, according to a report published on February 21 by one of the organizers of the trial. Two companies did not respond to the researchers compiling the report. The study was released Wednesday by Autonomy, a think tank that ran the 2022 trial with nonprofit 4 Day Week Global and the 4 Day Week UK Campaign in partnership with researchers from Cambridge and Oxford universities, and Boston College. The effects of reduced working hours have been overwhelmingly beneficial for staff and their companies, according to the report. At the end of the trial, employees reported enjoying better physical and mental health, greater work-life balance and general life satisfaction, and less exhaustion from work \u2014 and these improvements have been maintained one year on. \u201cThe key point is that the strong findings at six months are not due to novelty or short-term impacts. These effects are real and long-lasting,\u201d said Juliet Schor, professor of sociology at Boston College, which surveyed staff at the companies that participated in the trial. Managers and CEOs at 28 of the organizations also agreed to answer additional questions. All said the four-day week had a positive impact on their company. Staff turnover fell at half of the organizations, almost a third said the policy had noticeably improved recruitment, and 82% reported beneficial effects on staff well-being. The Autonomy report also highlights the methods organizations have used to sustain a four-day week, including revising the norms around meetings, work communications and prioritization. \u201cIn this study, it has been clear the four-day week is not just a flash in the pan: companies around the UK have successfully been \u2018making it stick\u2019,\u201d the authors wrote. Close to half of the 61 organizations that took part in the 2022 trial are in marketing and advertising, professional services, and the nonprofit sector. The remainder span a range of industries, including construction, manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and arts and entertainment. Calls to shorten the working week have multiplied\u00a0in recent years. These calls have grown louder after millions of employees switched to remote work during the pandemic and stopped commuting, saving time and money. There have been a number of experiments with the four-day week around the world, including a\u00a0trial in 2022 across 33 companies, with the majority of workers based in the United States and Ireland.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/02/22/business/four-day-work-week-uk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

Sales have been flagging recently. The company expects to sell 13.5 million Switch units in the current financial year, according to Reuters, compared to sales of 15.7 million units last year. Nintendo has a long and storied track record of reinventing the wheel for both consoles and games, and the Switch has been one of its most successful products to date. When it first launched in 2017, it took the world by storm primarily for its portability. At a time when major rivals like Playstation and Xbox were developing stationary consoles with increasingly impressive graphics and processing power, Nintendo opted for another route. The handheld Switch could be used both as a console for a television at home, and also be thrown into a bag and played on the move. While its graphic performance was much lower than its Sony (SONY) and Microsoft (MSFT) rivals, consumers didn\u2019t mind thanks to the plethora of entertaining and often family friendly games in Nintendo\u2019s stable. Over the last seven years, little has changed in terms of the Switch\u2019s development with three distinct models currently available for prospective owners.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_media_planet-fitness-membership-inflation", "text": "The Planet Fitness $10-a-month membership plan is a powerful marketing tool and a central part of its strategy. But the largest gym chain in the United States is hiking that monthly fee for the first time in more than two decades. Planet Fitness will raise the price of its \u201cclassic\u201d membership from $10 a month to $15 for new members beginning in the summer. The \u201cclassic\u201d membership gives people access to one location. (Planet Fitness\u2019 $25 monthly \u201cBlack Club\u201d membership offers more location access and perks. Planet Fitness is not hiking this fee, although executives said they may begin testing higher prices for the plan.) Planet Fitness executives did not specify why the chain is raising the basic plan by 50% for the first time since 1998, but the move comes as higher interest rates and construction costs have slowed down new gym openings. Planet Fitness has no-frills gyms, with a basic selection of machines, no steam rooms or towels in the locker room to hold down costs. Higher costs threaten its business model \u2014 known in the fitness industry as high volume, low price, or \u201cHVLP\u201d \u2014 more so than luxury gyms. Businesses around the country have raised prices since the pandemic began in 2020, but Planet Fitness\u2019 $10 fee was one of the few things that had not changed because it was synonymous with the brand. \u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018get you off the couch\u2019 price,\u201d Planet Fitness\u2019 former CEO told CNN in 2022. Planet Fitness has long used the $10 basic membership to recruit people who are interested in exercising but have never joined a gym before, are intimidated by fitness fanatics at other gyms or can\u2019t afford pricier clubs. (A gym membership in the United States typically costs around $50 a month, and boutique gyms and high-intensity classes run double and triple that.) Planet Fitness blared out the $10 gym plan, which includes annual fees and free training, in commercials. The company has sponsored the New Year\u2019s Eve celebration in Times Square for years to get people thinking about signing up for memberships as their resolution. Forty percent of new Planet Fitness members have never belonged to a gym prior to signing up, according to the company. The $10 price was right in the sweet spot: cheap enough to draw people to Planet Fitness who want to get in shape and, equally as important, not so expensive that they will cancel if they don\u2019t go often, say analysts. Planet Fitness then tries to upsell these members by pushing them to its Black Card membership. The higher-priced monthly plan offers access to all of Planet Fitness\u2019 gyms and perks like water massage beds, massage chairs and tanning equipment, and Black Card members can also bring a visitor. On a conference call Thursday, one analyst, Sharon Zackfia from William Blair, said, \u201cit does seem like an odd time to take a 50% price increase on the classic card,\u201d given that consumers have been strained by inflation and are searching for deals. But Planet Fitness executives said consumers have grown accustomed to price hikes and the move will not hurt business. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in every industry people move in price,\u201d Planet Fitness interim CEO Craig Benson said. \u201cSo, it is not going to come as a shock to anybody that we are moving a price that\u2019s been in effect for a long, long time.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/media/planet-fitness-membership-inflation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_07_success_presidential-election-years-market-performance", "text": "Elections do have consequences. But if the past century is any guide, the long-term consequences of US presidential election years on investor portfolios, including 401(k)s, is minimal at best. A recent analysis by retirement planning firm TIAA considered how a moderate-risk portfolio with 60% stocks and 40% bonds fared across all presidential election years since 1928. Turns out there were only four years that had negative returns: 1932 (down 1.4%); 1940 (down 4.7%); 2000 (down 0.8%); and 2008 (down 20.1%). Unsurprisingly, those four presidential election years occurred at times of seismic events: The Great Depression. World War II. The implosion of the tech bubble. And the housing and financial crisis that created the Great Recession. But, over time, those negative returns didn\u2019t move the needle in terms of long-term average performance. TIAA found that a 60/40 portfolio had an average annual return of 8.7% across the 24 presidential election years since 1928 \u2014 just a hair above the 8.5% average for the same portfolio during all non-election years over that same period. \u201cOver a very long period of time, it washes out,\u201d said Niladri Mukherjee, chief investment officer at TIAA. Of course, very few investors have a portfolio in play for that long and even fewer maintain the same stock-to-bond ratio throughout. But even if you look at shorter time horizons and just focus on stocks, the same general trend appears to hold. The S&P 500 alone has generated an average return of 7% during presidential election years since 1952, according to LPL Financial. If you limit that to presidential election years in which the incumbent president is running for reelection, the average jumps to 12.2%. \u201cWe believe this pattern is partly due to the incumbent priming the pump ahead of the election with fiscal stimulus and pro-growth regulatory policies to stave off potential recession and encourage job growth,\u201d Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL, wrote in a December 2023 blog post about his firm\u2019s analysis. Market performance will be about more than who becomes president What about this election year? Whether the winner is President Joe Biden or former President Donald Trump, how the markets react in the short term are difficult to predict. \u201cElection years come with higher levels of volatility,\u201d Mukherjee said. The longer-term consequences in the markets are even harder to gauge. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, if history is any guide, investors will factor their decisions going forward based on fundamentals in the United States and around the world, as well as the risks of geopolitical unrest, Mukherjee said. In other words, he noted, economic growth, corporate profits, inflation, standard of living and productivity will remain paramount. Market analysts from US Bank echoed similar sentiments in a report late last year. \u201cEconomic and inflation trends have demonstrated a stronger and more consistent relationship with market returns than election results,\u201d they wrote. What\u2019s more, how the House and Senate take shape will play a big role in how policies are achieved. \u201cThe makeup of Congress is really important when it comes to fiscal policy and real changes that can be implemented,\u201d Mukherjee said. \u201cEven though (presidential) candidates say a lot of things, they may not be able to implement them.\u201d What all this means for the average investor Generally speaking, no one can consistently and successfully time the market or predict the future. So, being sufficiently diversified across different asset classes and sectors, while also very conservatively investing money you\u2019ll need in the next few years, has always been sensible advice. So if you\u2019re anxious about the upcoming election \u2014 or just dead certain US and global markets will react one way or the other depending on the winner \u2014 Mukherjee recommends not making investment decisions based on your predictions. Instead, he suggests you consult with a financial adviser to make sure your current allocations fit well with your time horizon, risk tolerance and goals. Or, if those already do, maybe just sit tight. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to make a change in a nonelection year, you shouldn\u2019t do so in a presidential election year,\u201d Mukherjee said. You also may want to consider some useful tips on how to avoid investing based on your strong feelings from psychologist Daniel Crosby, who wrote \u201cThe Behavioral Investor.\u201d For instance, Crosby warns, if your fears are activated, you can panic and sell at the wrong time, he said. Or, if you\u2019re elated,\u00a0your optimism may distort your level of risk in an investment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/success/presidential-election-years-market-performance/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_07_tech_apple-unveils-new-ipad-lineup", "text": "Apple is hoping its latest iPad lineup will breathe new life into its sluggish tablet market. In a pre-recorded live streamed event from its Cupertino, California headquarters, the company introduced the latest versions of its iPad Pro and iPad Air tablets, and an all-new Apple Pencil Pro. CEO Tim Cook said Tuesday\u2019s announcement marked \u201cthe biggest day for iPad since its introduction.\u201d At the heart of the new iPad Pro is Apple\u2019s new custom M4 processor, which delivers 4 times the performance as its existing iPad Pro models. Considering Apple\u2019s latest MacBook lineup currently runs on the M3 chip, this is, as Cook put it, an \u201coutrageously powerful chip for AI.\u201d The company is expected to show off its first batch of AI-tools for the iPhone and iPad at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June. The latest iPad Pro comes in two sizes: 11 inches and 13 inches. Apple said the 11-inch model is its thinnest yet, at 5.1 mm, and less than a pound. The display combines two OLED panels to maximize brightness. The iPad Pro comes in two finishes, silver and space black. Meanwhile, the iPad Air, for the first time, comes in the same two sizes: an 11-inch ($599) and 13-inch ($799) design. The bigger size, inspired by the iPad Pro with a larger screen, has 30% more screen real estate than the 11-inch display. The iPad Air is powered by Apple\u2019s custom M2 processor with faster GPU and neural engine that\u2019s 50% faster than the previous iPad Air. The company said it better supports AI-powered software. It also features a front-facing landscape camera. Meanwhile, an upgraded Apple Pencil ($129) comes with a new squeeze function that allows users to bring up tools, customize drawing layers of what they\u2019re working on and includes haptic feedback. It also supports Find My to locate the pencil when it inevitably goes missing. Apple also showed off a redesigned Magic Keyboard with a haptic trackpad to make the iPad more like a laptop. Some key apps, including Final Cut, also received substantial upgrades, including the ability to add AI-based audio or edit with AI. The new iPad lineup is available for pre-order starting Tuesday and in stores next week. The event comes just days after Apple reported its iPad revenue of $5.6 billion for its latest quarter, down 17% year over year. However, the company said it expects its iPad business to grow in double digits for the June quarter. Apple also reported last week a first-quarter revenue of $90.8 billion, down 4% year over year, as the tech giant continues to struggle with growth challenges, particularly in China, amid an uncertain economic environment. It announced a $110 billion share buyback \u2013 the largest in the company\u2019s history \u2013 as iPhones sales declined 10%. Ben Wood, a chief analyst at market research firm CCS Insight, said the unexpected introduction of the iPad Pro\u2019s new M4 chip and its significant performance jumps may be enough to ignite some excitement among consumers. \u201cWhile these new iPads are unlikely to return the category to growth immediately, they represent a much-needed reason to upgrade for customers with aging products,\u201d he said. \u201cThe emphasis on artificial intelligence was palpable with Apple determined to seize back the initiative in this area given the huge focus on this topic by all its rivals over the last 18 months.\u201d On the earnings call last week, Cook teased that generative AI tools could be coming to Apple products in the \u201cweeks ahead,\u201d at a time when it\u2019s currently behind competitors. \u201cWe see generative AI as a key opportunity across our products and believe we have advantages that set us apart there,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/tech/apple-unveils-new-ipad-lineup/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Investors are grappling with a painful reality check: The Federal Reserve is unlikely to slash interest rates anytime soon. That, at least temporarily, stalled the gangbusters 2024 stock rally and lowered morale on Wall Street. Traders fear that elevated rates will uphold painfully high borrowing costs for consumers, squeeze corporate profit and weigh down the market. The good news? History suggests that higher-for-longer rates don\u2019t translate to painful losses for portfolios, even if there may not be much more upside near term for stocks.  The benchmark S&P 500 index has added roughly 13% on average during Fed pause periods, according to LPL Financial data compiled by CNN spanning about 35 years and six stretches when rates have been on hold. The S&P 500 has gained 14% during the current period, from when the Fed last hiked rates in July 2023 through Thursday\u2019s close. \u201cLong pauses are typically good for stocks,\u201d wrote Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, in a Tuesday note. \u201dIt\u2019s when the Fed is forced to cut because of economic weakness that stocks tend to sell off \u2014 not in the environment we\u2019re in today.\u201d The US economy has stayed remarkably resilient, even after the Fed began an aggressive battle against wayward inflation that brought rates to their highest level in decades. The labor market has stayed strong, consumers have continued spending and stocks have notched repeated record highs. That economic resilience, coupled with months of data showing sticky inflation, even raised concerns that the Fed would raise rates again. Chair Jerome Powell earlier this month quelled those fears but warned that the central bank needs to see inflation come down further before easing policy. \u201cSo far this year, the data have not given us that greater confidence. In particular, as I noted earlier, readings on inflation have come in above expectations,\u201d Powell said at the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s post-meeting press conference. Some economists say that the central bank, which has penciled in three rate cuts for 2024, is still on track to cut rates at least once or twice this year. Traders expect the Fed will begin easing rates in the fall, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The April jobs report was a welcome sign that the labor market is cooling without cratering. The labor market added just 175,000 positions last month, marking its lowest tally since October 2023 and a sharp cooldown from the upwardly revised 315,000 jobs added in March. April\u2019s job gains are in line with pre-pandemic levels and the neutral rate of job growth needed to pace with population growth. First-time applications for unemployment benefits climbed last week to 231,000, the highest level since last August, in another sign that the labor market is cooling. Annual wage gains, a potential inflation booster watched closely by the Fed, are at their lowest level since May 2021. The slowdown in both wage gain and payroll growth last month is supportive of hopes that the Fed can tamp down inflation without triggering a recession, according to some investors. \u201cThe case for rate cuts got a little stronger,\u201d wrote David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation, in a note earlier this month. \u201cGoldilocks could be making a comeback.\u201d Treasury launches \u2018Project Fortress,\u2019 an alliance with banks against hackers The US federal government is teaming up with Wall Street in a new cybersecurity alliance aimed at defending the financial system from a nightmare attack and deterring hackers from even trying, according to a letter sent to bank CEOs by a senior Treasury official and viewed by CNN. The new public-private partnership, dubbed Project Fortress, underscores the real danger US officials and bank executives believe cyberattacks pose to the economy, reports my colleague Matt Egan. \u201cThe message to bad actors who want to use cyberspace to go after US financial institutions is: We are watching, we are protecting the system and we will come after you if you go after the US financial system,\u201d a US official told CNN. Project Fortress includes protective measures such as a new cyber hygiene tool that automatically scans companies for vulnerabilities and a new automated threat feed, according to the letter, which was sent to bank trade groups earlier this week. But Project Fortress is not just about playing defense. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in the letter that the alliance also includes \u201coffensive actions\u201d that employ Treasury\u2019s national security tools as well as US law enforcement to \u201cmake clear to our adversaries that they will face consequences for their attacks.\u201d Those national security tools include deploying Treasury\u2019s sanctions team, a person familiar with the matter told CNN.

Asia\u2019s most powerful billionaires are getting drawn into the world\u2019s biggest election Two of the planet\u2019s richest businessmen are becoming embroiled in India\u2019s increasingly divisive election campaign, reports my colleague Diksha Madhok. The world\u2019s most populous nation is in the midst of a mammoth election in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is widely expected to secure a rare third consecutive term. Modi is running on his economic record over the past 10 years, a period of robust growth for India, as well as for its two most famous billionaires: Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani. Likened to the industrialists who helped build America\u2019s \u201cGilded Age,\u201d both men are considered vocal champions of Modi and their perceived closeness has been the subject of intense criticism by rival politicians. But at an election rally on Wednesday, Modi appeared to accuse his primary political opponent of accepting money from Ambani, chairman of India\u2019s most valuable private company Reliance Industries, and Gautam Adani, the founder of ports-to-energy conglomerate the Adani Group. \u201cWhy has Shahzade Ji stopped talking of Ambani and Adani in this election all of sudden? People are smelling a secret deal,\u201d Modi said on X, where he posted a video of his speech. Shahzade, or prince, is a widely understood reference to Rahul Gandhi, the longtime face of main opposition party Indian National Congress. \u201cHow much money have you taken from Ambani and Adani?\u201d he said at the rally.

{"id": "2024_05_09_business_chevrolet-killing-off-chevy-malibu-sedan", "text": "The Chevrolet Malibu, the last sedan still sold by General Motors\u2019 biggest selling brand, will end production this year, the company announced. Malibu production will end in November as the factory that builds it, the Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas City, Kansas, is reconfigured to build a new generation of the Chevrolet Bolt EV. With the Malibu\u2019s demise, General Motors\u2019 mainstream Chevrolet brand will sell only trucks, SUVs, and the Corvette, a two-seat sports car, in the United States. Chevy\u2019s close competitor, Ford, made a similar move years ago when it stopped selling the Taurus and Fusion sedans, leaving the two-door Mustang as the only traditional car in its line-up. Chevrolet stopped making its Mustang competitor, the Camaro, last year. Traditional cars \u2013 vehicles that are not SUVs, trucks or vans \u2013 make up less than 20% of US auto sales, according to Cox Automotive. The last generation of the Malibu was first introduced in 2016, making it much older than competitors such as the relatively popular Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. A new version of the Camry, now available only as a hybrid, just went into production. Still, GM sold more than 130,000 Malibus last year, a 13% increase from the year before. Last year, the Malibu was sold mostly to fleet operators, such as rental car companies, according to Cox Automotive. In any given month of 2023, more than half of Malibus were sold to fleets and, in some months, it was nearly 75%, Cox spokesman Mark Schirmer said in an email. For the Accord and Camry, while fleets still make up a significant portion of sales, close to 70% were sold to individuals last year. \u201cHonda and Toyota alike must be pleasantly surprised to see their competitors pack up and leave the\u00a0mid-size sedan business,\u201d Schirmer said. \u201cThe segment remains sizable \u2013 over 900,000 mid-size sedans were bought in 2023 \u2013 and Honda and Toyota have excellent offerings, and now with little competition.\u201d The Malibu was introduced back in the 1960s as a more luxurious version of the Chevrolet Chevelle, called the Chevelle Malibu. By the 1970s, it had become its own distinct model. The Malibu model line ended production in 1983 but was brought back again in 1997, and has been in production since then. The Malibu, a mid-sized sedan, sells at sticker prices starting around $26,000 for basic versions and more than $30,000 for well-equipped models.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/business/chevrolet-killing-off-chevy-malibu-sedan/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_economy_uk-gdp-growth-recession-elections", "text": "The United Kingdom has come out of a short and shallow recession, giving Prime Minister Rishi Sunak a sorely needed boost ahead of an election expected later this year. Gross domestic product grew 0.6% in the first three months of the year compared with the previous quarter, data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed Friday. The increase follows falls of 0.3% in the fourth quarter and 0.1% in the third quarter of last year. A recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction. The expansion early this year was driven by \u201cwidespread growth\u201d in the dominant service sector, where output ticked up 0.7% during the quarter after dipping late last year, the ONS said. According to projections published Thursday, the Bank of England now expects UK GDP to grow 0.5% this year, double the pace it forecast in February. By comparison, last year, GDP increased by a measly 0.1%. There are other signs the economy\u2019s prospects are brightening. In April, combined output in manufacturing and services recorded the strongest rise in almost a year, according to a survey of purchasing managers compiled by S&P Global. Again, service firms drove the expansion. However, compared with its peers, the UK economy is faring less well. Last month, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecast for Britain\u2019s economic growth this year from 0.6% to 0.5%. That is the second-slowest predicted growth rate among the Group of Seven developed economies, ahead of only Germany. \u201cAlthough there are welcome signs of green shoots, any recovery is still at an early stage and it is likely to be fragile,\u201d said Roger Barker, head of policy at the Institute of Directors, a business lobby group. Looming election Still, the evidence of growth this year will provide some relief to Sunak and his ruling Conservative Party, which suffered heavy losses in local elections last week, boding ill for the party\u2019s chances in the general election. Sunak underwent further embarrassment this week when one of his lawmakers defected to the opposition Labour Party. Jeremy Hunt, the UK finance minister, said in a statement that the growth figures were \u201cproof that the economy is returning to full health for the first time since the pandemic.\u201d But Rachel Reeves, his counterpart in the Labour Party, said that, despite the uptick in GDP, British households were still struggling. \u201cFood prices are still high, families are paying more on their monthly mortgage bills and working people are worse-off,\u201d she wrote in a post on X. \u201cFrom no growth to low growth \u2014 is that really the scale of the Conservatives\u2019 ambitions?\u201d According to polls, the Labour Party is on track to roundly beat the Conservatives in the general election. In a survey conducted this week by YouGov, 48% of respondents said they intended to vote for Labour in the election, compared with 18% for the Conservatives. Inflationary pressure? Mortgage rates may also stay high for longer if a return to economic growth delays the interest rate cuts widely expected this year. \u201cStronger GDP growth raises the risk of stronger demand pressures on inflation,\u201d analysts at Nomura wrote in a note, adding that Friday\u2019s GDP release \u201ccasts doubt\u201d over a cut in June. They expect the Bank of England to start cutting the cost of borrowing in August. Annual UK inflation came in at 3.2% last month, a sharp slowdown from a rate above 10% about a year ago. The central bank targets a rate of 2% and expects to more or less reach it in the next few months, according to Governor Andrew Bailey. \u201cInflation has fallen a lot\u2026 (but) we need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates,\u201d he said Thursday, after the central bank announced its decision to hold official borrowing costs at 5.25%. Bailey did not rule out an interest rate cut in June, but told journalists it was not a given and would be informed by data releases in the coming weeks on inflation and the labor market.

{"id": "2024_05_09_tech_china-qu-jing-baidu-pr-backlash-hnk-intl", "text": "A Chinese tech executive has ignited outrage in China with her fiery endorsement of toxic workplace culture, which eventually caused her to lose her own job. Qu Jing,\u00a0the\u00a0former vice president and head of communications\u00a0at Baidu, often dubbed China\u2019s equivalent to Google, sparked a public relations crisis for the Chinese search engine after her controversial comments hit a raw nerve with young workers fed up with grueling hours and relentless pressure. In a series of short videos posted last week on Douyin, China\u2019s version of TikTok, Qu spoke about her devotion to her career, strict management style and unflagging demands on her direct reports. In one video, she lashed out at an employee who refused to go on a 50-day business trip during the Covid-19 pandemic, when China imposed stringent travel restrictions and quarantines. \u201cWhy should I take my employee\u2019s family into consideration? I\u2019m not her mother-in-law,\u201d Qu said. \u201cI\u2019m 10 years, 20 years older than you. I didn\u2019t feel bitter about it or tired, even though I have two children. Who are you to tell me that your husband can\u2019t stand it?\u201d In another clip, Qu shared her personal sacrifices as a working mother. She was working so hard that she forgot her elder son\u2019s birthday and what grade her younger son was in at school. She said she didn\u2019t regret it because she \u201cchose to become a career woman.\u201d \u201cIf you work in public relations, don\u2019t expect weekends off,\u201d she said in a third video.\u00a0\u201cKeep your phone on 24 hours a day, always ready to respond.\u201d In another video, she also threatened to retaliate against employees who complain about her, saying they wouldn\u2019t get another job in the industry. The\u00a0American Psychological Association\u00a0describes \u201ctoxic workplace\u201d as an environment filled with infighting, intimidation and other affronts that harm productivity. Following the public outcry, Qu has lost her own job at Baidu (BIDU), a person familiar with the matter told CNN on condition of anonymity. CNN has also seen a screenshot of an internal personnel system that appears to confirm she no longer works at the company. Baidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment. By Thursday night, Qu had removed the title of \u201cBaidu\u2019s vice president\u201d from her account on Douyin. Qu had apologized earlier in the day and said her posts did not speak for Baidu. \u2018Lack of empathy\u2019 The controversy soon became a trending topic on Douyin and Weibo, China\u2019s X-like platform, dominating online discussions. Users\u00a0criticized Qu for her aggressive and insensitive approach and accused her, and Baidu, of\u00a0promoting a toxic workplace. \u201cIn her voice and in her tone, there\u2019s deep indifference to and lack of empathy for the common plight of her colleagues,\u201d said Ivy Yang, a China tech analyst and founder of consulting firm Wavelet Strategy. \u201cA lot of what she said really struck a nerve, because people feel that in their own workplaces very often. The fact that she said it in a way that\u2019s so direct and\u00a0in your face, it just generated this kind of emotional response,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is what the bosses are thinking, and she was merely saying it out aloud,\u201d Yang added. China\u2019s young workers have increasingly spoken out against\u00a0the culture of excessive overwork and extreme competitiveness\u00a0that has come to dominate many industries, especially the tech sector. In 2019, Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma drew intense criticism after endorsing the \u201c996\u201d trend, meaning working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week, and calling it a \u201chuge blessing.\u201d Yang called the backlash against Ma a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d that led people to rethink the relationship between the workplace and themselves \u2014\u00a0a trend that has only intensified as the Chinese economy slows. China\u2019s economy grew stronger than expected at the start of this year, but problems \u2014 including a\u00a0property crisis, declining\u00a0foreign investment\u00a0and\u00a0tepid consumption\u00a0\u2014 are piling up. \u201cWhen companies demand complete loyalty, time and energy from their employees, employees feel there\u2019s no reciprocity or reward for their sacrifice or contribution, especially when things are slowing down. That becomes the central conflict, and this conflict is also at the heart of the Baidu saga,\u201d Yang added. As public anger mounted, the videos posted on Qu\u2019s personal Douyin account were taken down. \u2018Inappropriate points\u2019 After days of silence, Qu apologized on Thursday for \u201ccausing such a big storm\u201d in a post on her personal account on WeChat, China\u2019s most popular social media app. \u201cI have carefully read all the opinions and comments from various platforms, and many criticisms are very pertinent. I deeply reflect on and humbly accept them,\u201d Qu wrote. She also sought to put distance between her remarks and Baidu, saying she had not sought approval beforehand and that they did not represent the company\u2019s stance. \u201cThere were many inappropriate and unsuitable points made in the videos, which led to misunderstandings about the company\u2019s values and culture, causing serious harm,\u201d Qu wrote. A person familiar with the matter said Qu\u2019s clips were part of her push to amplify Baidu\u2019s voice on short video platforms, which have become an increasingly important channel for information dissemination in China. Qu had asked all members of the PR team to create their personal accounts, according to the person, who requested anonymity. \u201cThe main purpose is to improve everyone\u2019s ability to make short videos. Everyone can have different options over the content, and Cristina chose to speak about her personal experience,\u201d said the person, referring to Qu\u2019s English name. Qu worked as a reporter for China\u2019s state news agency Xinhua before switching to the PR industry. She joined Baidu in 2021 from Huawei, a Chinese tech giant known for its hard-charging \u201cwolf culture,\u201d where employees are expected to emulate wolves\u2019 bloodthirsty nature, fearlessness and resilience. A former Baidu employee said Qu brought Huawei\u2019s aggressive corporate culture with her to Baidu. \u201c(She triggered) a pretty big culture shock. About 60% of the team left within months of her arrival,\u201d the former employee told CNN on the condition of anonymity. The PR team is expected to always be available, keep their phones on, reply to messages immediately and attend meetings at midnight and on weekends with short notice, the former employee said. Qu also adopted the military-style language used in corporate management at Huawei, requiring the team to be \u201cdisciplined\u201d and \u201cable to win battles,\u201d the former employee said. CNN has reached out to Huawei for comment.

{"id": "2024_05_10_business_india-election-economic-boom-winners-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "As Indians head to the polls in a massive ongoing nationwide election, much attention has focused on the country\u2019s explosive growth under Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s leadership. During his past decade in office, India\u2019s fast-growing economy has become the world\u2019s fifth largest as the country woos foreign investors and embarks on a massive infrastructure transformation, spending billions on new highways, ports, airports and railways. While not everyone has benefited and income inequality has deepened \u2014 millions still live in sprawling slums and youth unemployment has soared \u2014 Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are widely expected to win another five-year term and push forward that economic expansion. That\u2019s partly because many in the world\u2019s most populous country, especially among the younger generation, share a common belief: India is on the rise. More than 40% of India\u2019s 1.4 billion people is under 25: a massive, tech-savvy and mostly English-speaking labor force, with their eyes set on the future. Like millions of migrants from across the country, many of them are drawn to the country\u2019s financial capital Mumbai, full of aspiration and ambition. And it\u2019s stories like these that inspire them. The tech developer As a kid, Javed Khatri loved going to the train station. Not to catch a ride or watch the endless flow of people \u2013 but to stand near the ticket booth and glimpse the mainframe computers behind the counter. Growing up poor in the slums of Mumbai, he\u2019d never used a smartphone or computer. The screens and machines at the train station fascinated Khatri, the son of a carpenter and a housewife. \u201cIn the region where I used to stay, one of the best things that one could think of was just to complete 10th grade, and then work at a call center or sell vegetables or work at a garage or do some kind of odd jobs,\u201d says Khatri, now 30. \u201cThat was our topmost ambition.\u201d But he was lucky, he says. Unlike many children in the slums, his parents encouraged him to focus on education rather than start working young to help support the family. He completed 10th grade \u2013 the first person in four generations of his family to do so \u2013 then studied computer science at an engineering college. But it was a shock to the system. On his first day, the class was given tasks that Khatri\u2019s more privileged peers sailed through easily. Meanwhile, he was trying to figure out how to use a mouse and type on a keyboard. \u201cThat\u2019s where people started mocking me, they started making fun of me,\u201d he tells CNN from the high-rise building where he now works. \u201cI considered quitting engineering at one point in time because it was becoming unbearable.\u201d He sank into a six-month depression \u2014 but it was also a transformative period. He threw himself into learning everything he could. Online, he befriended people from around the world on forums, and took entrepreneurship courses. He was so fixated he often only slept four or five hours a night. \u201cThat was the hunger to learn back then,\u201d he says. \u201cI got introduced to a whole new world altogether.\u201d He started building apps and small businesses with his classmates, who began seeking out his company after noticing his improved skills. After graduating, he decided to start a mobile app developer with two co-founders and only 20,000 rupees (about $240) to his name. He was under pressure, with his parents and two younger siblings depending on his success. But his company forged ahead, and after several years he sold it for $2 million. He is now building a new online platform to connect tech firms with engineers, and says his success has changed the trajectory of his family. He moved them all out of the slum, and he supports his parents\u2019 early retirement. Both his siblings went to college and pursued their own careers. None of this would have been possible a generation ago, he says. \u201cOver the last 10 years, people have got access to the right kind of information with the help of the internet,\u201d he says. Now, the government is encouraging more startups, with growing awareness around entrepreneurship thanks to business reality shows like \u201cShark Tank,\u201d and its Indian spin-off. Among India\u2019s large cohort of young people, \u201cmore and more people are opting for entrepreneurship and creating more opportunities for the world and the country itself,\u201d he says. \u201cThis itself is a big sign that the next decade belongs to India.\u201d The influencer When the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020, college student Apoorva Mukhija moved back home with her parents \u2014 and hated it immediately. In their small township, \u201ceverybody knew everybody, everybody talked about each other,\u201d she says. Without good friends nearby, she turned to Instagram and started posting comedy videos. \u201cContent was my only escape, it kept me sane,\u201d she says. \u201cI was genuinely really desperate to talk to somebody, and so the camera was my friend.\u201d It felt like a natural step; Mukhija had always been the class clown, she says. But with much of the world confined to their homes, there was an unprecedented demand for online entertainment \u2013 and creators like her. She kept posting videos as she finished her computer science degree, on topics ranging from boredom in class to being reprimanded by parents, gaining hundreds of thousands of followers. But she hadn\u2019t planned to be a content creator, so after graduation she took a job with a tech firm in Bangalore, the southern city known as \u201cIndia\u2019s Silicon Valley.\u201d \u201cThen one day I just woke up, realized \u2026 (my job) just didn\u2019t pay as well as content did, and I hated living in that city,\u201d Mukhija, 22, tells CNN from a pastel-pink couch at her new apartment in Mumbai, which she says is her \u201cdream city.\u201d Her career has thrived, winning her recognition from local media and amassing 1.3 million Instagram followers, many of whom regularly stop her in the street for a selfie. The internet holds a wealth of opportunity for young Indians, Mukhija says. The country\u2019s influencer marketing industry is expected to be worth more than $281 million in 2024, and $405 million by 2026, according to an April report by consultancy EY India. Ubiquitous smartphones and social media are fueling this growth. There is expected to be 740 million active smartphone users in India by 2030, according to EY India. That\u2019s still less than half the population \u2013 underscoring the room for growth. And there\u2019s money to be made. Influencer marketing firm Kofluence estimated in a report this year that Indian influencers with more than 1 million Instagram followers can earn anywhere from 300,000 to 1,500,000 rupees (about $3,600 to $18,000) monthly depending on the size of their audience. That\u2019s a handsome sum in a country where the annual gross domestic product per capita is still around $2,400, according to the World Bank. This new, exciting space has opened doors for young creators like Mukhija, who just completed filming in her first acting role. Filmmakers are increasingly seeking out influencers to attract their fanbase, she says, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t go for auditions, auditions come to me.\u201d And, more significantly, she\u2019s been able to share her success with her parents, a civil servant and an English teacher. Though she\u2019d grown up with privileges like private school and domestic family holidays, it was thanks to her parents\u2019 sacrifices, she says. Her father had driven the same car for 16 years despite its frequent breakdowns, and they had never traveled outside India before. So in late 2022, she surprised her family with tickets to Dubai, their first international trip. The video, posted on Instagram, shows her younger brother gleefully jumping on the bed, and her mother wiping her eyes before pulling Mukhija into a hug. \u201cMy dad comes from nothing, he has built himself up,\u201d she tells CNN. \u201cSo it\u2019s just nice that they\u2019ve given me so much and maybe I can give a fraction of it back to them.\u201d She\u2019s dreaming bigger for herself, too. She has applied to MBA programs in London and California, which wouldn\u2019t have been possible without her content creation income. And with so many people across the country tuning in on their phones, that rise isn\u2019t slowing anytime soon. \u201cEverybody\u2019s a content creator today,\u201d Mukhija says. \u201cAnd with this much population, you ought to have an audience, no matter what kind of content you\u2019re making \u2026 In India, it\u2019s so easy to just find somebody to watch your content.\u201d The shoemaker Jameel Shah caught the Bollywood bug as a teenage runaway, fascinated by the sight of movie stars plastered on billboards in India\u2019s capital. \u201cI wanted to see them, and someone told me I would not find Bollywood stars in Delhi, but in Mumbai,\u201d he says. At age 13, Shah ran away from his village in Bihar, India\u2019s poorest state, where his father wasn\u2019t earning enough from farming to send the kids to school. Seeking work, he ran off to Delhi without telling anyone \u2014 but was soon on his way to Mumbai, the birthplace of Hindi cinema. But once in Mumbai, he was scammed out of his savings by a friend who disappeared after making false promises to introduce him to Bollywood stars. He followed the scammer to Bangalore before he ran out of money and became stranded. That proved to be a turning point. Shah started working as a security guard at a building that housed a dance studio, where he watched people whirl and stomp across the floor with wide-eyed intrigue \u2013 until the studio owner agreed to let him learn for free. Dancing with female partners was foreign and shocking. \u201cWhere I came from, one cannot be at such close proximity with women,\u201d says Shah, 40. \u201cThere was a shortage of men in the class, so I was given two women to dance with, which made me very happy.\u201d By the time he returned to Mumbai as an 18-year-old, his passion for dance had taken root and he continued learning for free under a Bollywood choreographer while working odd jobs. Every week, he would walk from his home in Dharavi, Asia\u2019s biggest slum, to dance classes in an affluent nearby district of tall office buildings, upscale hotels and foreign consulates. Seeing all this, \u201cI still wanted to do something better in life,\u201d Shah says. Finally, he saw his opportunity in the expensive imported dance shoes required for class. \u201cI wanted to make similar shoes that were printed with \u2018Made in India,\u2019\u201d Shah says. He took two samples back to the narrow alleys of Dharavi, a long-established hub for leather and textile manufacturers. With their expertise, and his own experience working in bag and wallet factories, Shah began experimenting. After four years of trial and error, Shah Shoes was born. The business grew, attracting stylists and choreographers who redistributed the shoes to dance studios. And they even made it onto the big screen. \u201cI have made shoes for a lot of Bollywood stars like Priyanka Chopra and Katrina Kaif. Many times I am not aware that these actors have used my shoes; it\u2019s only when I see them dancing (in movies) I realize that they were made by me because of their unique cut, design and style,\u201d Shah says.

{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security", "text": "The Federal Trade Commission is investigating TikTok for its data and security practices, two sources told CNN on the condition of anonymity. The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_media_oprah-winfrey-weightwatchers-diet-culture-ozempic", "text": "Oprah Winfrey said on Thursday evening that she has long played a role in promoting unhealthy and unrealistic diets. \u201cI want to acknowledge that I have been a steadfast participant in this diet culture,\u201d she said during a live event broadcast on YouTube in partnership with WeightWatchers. \u201cThrough my platforms, through the magazine, through the talk show for 25 years and online. I\u2019ve been a major contributor to it. I cannot tell you how many weight loss shows and makeovers I have done and they have been a staple since I\u2019ve been working in television,\u201d she said. Winfrey admitted that through her focus on weight, she \u201cset a standard for people watching that I nor anybody else could uphold.\u201d The three-hour live special, which also featured actresses Rebel Wilson, Amber Riley, WeightWatchers CEO Sima Sistani and a number of doctors and other expert voices, highlighted a shift away from diet culture for WeightWatchers and toward body acceptance and medical intervention with drugs like Ozempic. Sistani said during the special that the company acknowledges that weight loss isn\u2019t strictly a matter of willpower and that diet culture and body shaming isn\u2019t healthy. Winfrey told People Magazine in December that she has added a \u201cweight-loss medication to her regimen\u201d but didn\u2019t specify which drug. Winfrey and WeightWatchers Winfrey left the board of WeightWatchers, ending a nearly decade-long stint as a director of the beleaguered company, in February. At the time, a WeightWatchers regulatory statement said that her \u201cdecision was not the result of any disagreement\u201d or \u201cany matter relating to the company\u2019s operations, policies or practices.\u201d Winfrey also said she would be giving away her sizable stake in the company: She said in a statement that she\u2019s donating all of her stock to National Museum of African American History and Culture. Winfrey\u2019s exit was a year earlier than expected, with the media mogul in 2019 signing an extension until 2025. \u201cOprah is an inspiring presence and passionate advocate both for our members and for society at large, in elevating the conversation around weight health,\u201d said Sistani, on a call with investors at the time. \u201cWhile I and the rest of our directors will certainly miss her in our board meetings following the end of her current term, she remains a strong strategic voice and collaborator with WeightWatchers.\u201d WeightWatchers shares (WW) are down nearly 75% over the last 12 months, but soared more than 11% higher on Thursday, ahead of the live event hosted by Winfrey. Oprah said during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel in March that she decided [to leave the WeightWatchers board] because she \u201cwanted to be able to talk about whatever I want to talk about,\u201d during the live special and because WeightWatchers \u201cis now in the business of being a weight-health company that also administers drug medications for weight. I did not want to have the appearance of any conflict of interest.\u201d The GLP-1 revolution WeightWatchers in December launched a new membership plan for members taking GLP-1 prescriptions drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy sometimes used for weight loss. The \u201cWeightWatchers GLP-1 Program\u201d gives WeightWatchers members on semaglutide medications access to doctors who can prescribe these medications, as well as daily nutrition plans, insurance coordination, and other weight loss support programs. The announcement came months after WeightWatchers made a $100 million-plus deal to buy Sequence, a telehealth business that offers virtual prescriptions to patients for these weight loss drugs where appropriate. \u201cI will say that I was on the board at the time there were discussions about whether or not WeightWatchers would move into weight loss medications,\u201d Winfrey said on Thursday. \u201cAnd as someone who struggled on WeightWatchers, I said \u2018you all better join them or you will be overrun.\u2019 And so I was in support of the company buying Sequence and going into that whole avenue.\u201d WeightWatchers currently offers both a GLP-1 program and clinic. The GLP-1 Program provides those already taking GLP-1s behavioral and nutritional guidance for weight health management, while the WeightWatchers Clinic is a telehealth service that provides access to certified clinicians and weight loss medications.

{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

The Bureau of Prisons\u2019 online database currently shows that Holmes\u2019 expected release date from a Texas prison is August 16, 2032 \u2014 a slight reduction from her previous release date of December 29, 2032. It\u2019s her second reduction in less than a year: She previously had her 11-year-and-three-month sentence by about two years last July. The Bureau of Prisons didn\u2019t immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. However, the bureau previously told CNN that it can\u2019t comment on the conditions of any individual inmate, but said that inmates can earn good conduct time that is calculated into their projected release date. Qualified inmates are currently eligible for up to 54 days of GCT time for each year of the sentence imposed by the court. Inmates have other ways of earning time credits while incarcerated, including  participation in various prison programs. These factors that go into calculating an estimated release date are not unique to Holmes\u2019 case, but standard for inmates, a bureau spokesman previously told CNN. Holmes is currently serving out her sentence at Federal Prison Camp Bryan, a minimum security federal prison camp that is approximately 100 miles from Houston. Her request to remain free on bail while she fights to overturn her conviction was denied by an appellate court in May 2023. Holmes was once an icon in the tech world, serving as a poster child for the limitless ambitions and potential of Silicon Valley.

{"id": "2024_05_10_business_target-pride-merchandise-june-2024", "text": "Target is limiting the number of stores that will sell LGBTQ-themed merchandise for Pride Month in June following a boycott from right-wing activists last year that took a toll on the brand\u2019s bottom line. This year, Target said it will sell only Pride-themed \u201cadult apparel\u201d and  home goods \u201cin select stores, based on historical sales performance\u201d \u2014 a drastic reversal for the chain that had typically sold the items in all of its US stores for the past decade. About half of its 2,000 stores will sell the Pride collection, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the news. The assortment will also be sold on Target\u2019s website. A Target spokesperson said in a statement to CNN that it\u2019s \u201ccommitted to supporting\u201d the LGBTQ community during Pride Month, citing internal programs and presence at local Pride events, including in its hometown of Minneapolis. \u201cMost importantly, we want to create a welcoming and supportive environment for our LGBTQIA+ team members, which reflects our culture of care for the over 400,000 people who work at Target,\u201d the company said in a statement. The changes are a \u201csensible approach,\u201d Neil Saunders, managing director of retail for GlobalData, told CNN.

Pride problems Last year, Target pulled Pride merchandise from some stores after the company and its employees became the focus of a \u201cvolatile\u201d anti-LGBTQ campaign, which included threats against its store workers. The company previously told the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0that people have confronted workers in stores, knocked down Pride merchandise displays and put threatening posts on social media with video from inside stores.

Misinformation spread on social media that it was marketed to children, which it was not. That, plus the soft demand for discretionary goods, caused Target\u2019s quarterly sales to fall for the first time in six years during the quarter that encompassed Pride assortment sales.

{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

Big Tech is racing to address the stream of A.I.-generated images inundating social media platforms before the machine-crafted renderings further contaminate the information space. TikTok\u00a0announced on Thursday\u00a0that it will begin labeling A.I.-generated content.\u00a0Meta\u00a0(the parent company of\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Threads and\u00a0Facebook)\u00a0said last month\u00a0that it will begin labeling such content. And\u00a0YouTube\u00a0introduced rules\u00a0mandating creators disclose when videos are A.I.-created so that a label can be applied. (Notably,\u00a0Elon Musk\u2019s X\u00a0has not announced any plans to label A.I.-generated content.) With less than 200 days until the high-stakes November election, and as the technology advances at break-neck speed, the three largest social media companies have each outlined plans to ensure their billions of users can differentiate between content generated by machines and humans. Meanwhile,\u00a0OpenAI, the\u00a0ChatGPT-creator that allows users to also create A.I.-generated imagery through its\u00a0DALL-E\u00a0model,\u00a0said this week\u00a0that it will launch a tool that allows users to detect when an image is built by a bot. Additionally, the company said that\u00a0it will launch\u00a0an election-related $2 million fund with\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0to combat deepfakes that can \u201cdeceive the voters and undermine democracy.\u201d The efforts from\u00a0Silicon Valley represent an acknowledgment that the tools being built by technological titans have the serious potential to wreak havoc on the information space and inflict grave injury to the democratic process. A.I.-generated imagery has already proven to be particularly deceptive. Just this week, an A.I.-created image of pop star\u00a0Katy Perry\u00a0supposedly posing on the\u00a0Met Gala\u00a0red carpet in metallic and floral dresses fooled people into believing that the singer attended the annual event, when in fact she did not. The image was so realistic that Perry\u2019s own mother believed it to be authentic. \u201cDidn\u2019t know you went to the Met,\u201d Perry\u2019s mom texted the singer, according to a screen shot\u00a0posted by Perry. \u201clol, mom the AI got you too, BEWARE!\u201d Perry replied. While the viral image didn\u2019t cause serious harm, it\u2019s not difficult to imagine a scenario \u2014\u00a0particularly ahead of a major election\u00a0\u2014 in which a fake photograph could mislead voters and stir confusion, perhaps tipping the scale in favor of one candidate or another. But, despite the repeated and alarming warnings from industry experts and figures, the federal government has, thus far, failed to take any action to establish safeguards around the industry. And so, Big Tech has been left to its own devices to rein in the technology before bad actors can exploit it for their own benefit. (What could possibly go wrong?) Whether the industry-led efforts can successfully curb the spread of damaging deepfakes remains to be seen. Social media giants have reams of rules prohibiting certain content on their platforms, but history has repeatedly shown that they have often failed to adequately enforce them and allowed malicious content to spread to the masses before taking action. That poor record doesn\u2019t inspire much confidence as A.I.-created images increasingly bombard the information environment \u2014 particularly as the U.S. hurtles toward an unprecedented election with democracy itself at stake.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/media/social-media-ai-images-november-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}

CNN contacted Victorinox after company CEO Carl Elsener Jr. told Swiss media outlet Blick that he is concerned about increasingly stringent regulations on knives in many markets. For example, increasing concern over the prevalence of knife crime means that the British government is considering new legislation on bladed articles, and Elsener himself referenced the country\u2019s rules. \u201cIn England or certain Asian countries, you are sometimes only allowed to carry a knife if you need to have it to do your job or operate outdoors,\u201d said Elsener. \u201cIn the city, however, when you go to school, to the cinema, or to go shopping, carrying pocketknives is severely restricted.\u201d Elsener cited the fact that knives are seen as weapons rather than tools in some countries, and revealed that the company is working on new tools for specific sports or outdoor activities, such as cycling. \u201cI have a cool tool for cyclists in mind.

{"id": "2024_05_09_business_columbia-protests-divestment-invs", "text": "As one of the lead negotiators for students protesting inside the grounds of Columbia University, Mahmoud Khalil said his primary objective was to get the university to sever all financial ties with Israel. But as he offered up draft agreements and counter proposals, spoke with mediators in the encampment and sat across the table from high-ranking school administrators, he said he quickly realized that school leaders \u201cwere willing to negotiate on anything but divestment.\u201d \u201cThe university made it very clear they didn\u2019t want to criticize Israel or \u2026 want their actions to be interpreted as criticism of Israel,\u201d Khalil said in an interview with CNN. Khalil, a 29-year-old Palestinian student seeking a master\u2019s degree in public affairs, shared copies of proposals he said he and another student negotiator presented to the administration. Khalil said Columbia never put anything in writing, instead making offers verbally. Still, the documents the students delivered to the administration shed new light on their discussions surrounding issues of divestiture, student amnesty, international aid, and concessions the university was willing to make. \u201cThe university refused to commit to divestment, and we wanted assurances,\u201d Khalil said. The records and interviews show that Khalil and fellow protesters were unwilling to accept terms offered by Columbia that were similar to proposals that students at other campuses, such as Brown University, had accepted. Columbia, like Brown, offered to review its investments and consider divestitures. But without a firm promise, Columbia\u2019s offer didn\u2019t go far enough for Khalil and other protesters, since the university had previously rejected divestment proposals. Just days after the encampment first appeared, Khalil said he and other protest leaders were offered a meeting with school president Minouche Shafik to discuss their demands. They declined, he said, believing it to be a publicity stunt by the school where the substance of their concerns and demands would not be addressed. Instead, they continued negotiating with other administrators from the school. Part of the protesters\u2019 demands called for more transparency of Columbia\u2019s investment portfolio to be able to fully assess the university\u2019s ties to Israel and the war in Gaza. Less than 1% of the school\u2019s $13.6 billion endowment is publicly disclosed. From that limited information, protestors identified small holdings in 19 companies they believe are connected to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, including defense contractors Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics that make weapons used by Israel, and Caterpillar, whose bulldozers have been used by Israel to demolish Palestinian infrastructure in the West Bank and have been used by the IDF during the ground invasion of Gaza. Based on the students\u2019 findings of Columbia\u2019s public investments, they asked for more transparency of the university\u2019s undisclosed financial holdings. The school did not offer to completely open its books to the students but, according to a statement from Shafik, instead offered a process for students to access the school\u2019s direct holdings and to more frequently update that list. The university also proposed launching programs to aid childhood development in the West Bank and Gaza, among other suggestions. Khalil said they then presented Columbia with another offer: Rather than dump Israel-tied investments, Columbia could instead divest from weapons manufacturing companies and any companies complicit in violating international law. Columbia again declined their offer, Khalil said, instead threatening suspensions for those at the encampment. At that point, Khalil and his co-negotiator got up and walked out. \u201cIt was clear they didn\u2019t want to do anything,\u201d he said. Shortly thereafter, in a statement on May 1, Shafik announced that the negotiations were over. She said that university leaders had engaged with protesters \u201cin serious dialogue in good faith\u201d and offered various overtures including the consideration of new divestment proposals but were \u201cunable to come to resolution.\u201d She had earlier stated that the university sought to collaboratively reach an agreement with protesters that would result in the orderly removal of the encampment, which she said had created an unwelcoming environment for many Jewish students and faculty. A spokesperson for Columbia declined to comment on the details of the negotiations but referred CNN to public comments from Shafik. The New York Police Department cleared the student encampment, which involved a variety of participants including Jewish students, after nearly two weeks. The school suspended Khalil, a move they later reversed. A university official who was unwilling to speak on record described Khalil\u2019s suspension as \u201cunintentional.\u201d Meanwhile, student protesters at some other universities were able to reach agreements with their administrations to reconsider divestiture. Just a few hours north, at Brown University, the administration agreed to consider divestment from companies that support Israel after what the school\u2019s president called \u201cproductive discussions\u201d with students, who in turn agreed to end their encampment. A school advisory committee will provide a recommendation on whether to divest in the fall, and then a university board will vote on the matter, according to the agreement. Northwestern University also reached a deal with protestors in which the school committed to answering questions about specific financial holdings and reestablishing an advisory committee for responsible investment. Other universities have rejected protesters\u2019 calls to divest from Israel and some have outright refused to negotiate. Speaking on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday, University of Florida President Ben Sasse said, \u201cWe just don\u2019t negotiate with people who scream the loudest \u2026 A lot of universities bizarrely give the most attention and most voice to the smallest, angriest group, and it\u2019s just not what we\u2019re going to do here.\u201d Given Columbia\u2019s history, Khalil and his fellow students had some reason to be hopeful that the school would be responsive to their demands. The university has a storied history of student protests and demands for divestments on other hot-button issues. Students in the 1980s called on the university to withdraw investments in companies doing business in South Africa, which then maintained a racial segregation policy called apartheid. Columbia\u2019s student senate approved a plan to divest in 1983 but the university\u2019s trustees initially opposed their efforts. The trustees eventually conceded and voted to sell most of the university\u2019s stock in US companies with business in the country. More recently, Columbia emerged as a leader when in 2015 it became the first college in the United States to divest from private prison companies after a student activist campaign that launched the year before. Columbia now also refrains from investing in publicly traded tobacco, thermal coal and fossil fuel companies. But when it comes to Israel, the university has long taken a different stance. In 2002, Columbia\u2019s then-president Lee Bollinger criticized a petition to divest from companies that had sold arms to Israel. At the time, Bollinger said, \u201cThe petition alleges human rights abuses and compares Israel to South Africa at the time of apartheid, an analogy I believe is both grotesque and offensive,\u201d according to the Columbia Daily Spectator student newspaper. An advisory committee sided with Bollinger in opposition to the petition, the paper reported. Comparisons between Israel and the apartheid system in South Africa that ended in the 1990s have sparked contentious debate. The advocacy group Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of seeking the \u201cdomination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians\u201d coupled with \u201csystematic oppression\u201d and \u201cinhumane acts,\u201d which the group argued amounts to apartheid.\u00a0Israel\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called those claims \u201cpreposterous and false.\u201d The Anti-Defamation League stated that Israel has safeguards for ensuring equal treatment of citizens and argued that the apartheid label \u201cwould seem to question the legitimacy of the world\u2019s only Jewish state.\u201d In 2016, a coalition of Columbia students again launched a campaign to push the university to cut ties with certain Israel-linked companies. That effort eventually led to an undergraduate student vote that favored divesting, but then-president Bollinger again opposed the effort and said in a 2020 statement that such matters aren\u2019t decided by student referendum and that the university \u201cshould not change its investment policies on the basis of particular views about a complex policy issue, especially when there is no consensus across the University community about that issue.\u201d The student newspaper reported last month that another vote at Columbia College \u2013 an undergraduate school at the university \u2013 overwhelmingly favored divestment from Israel, though less than half of the college\u2019s students participated. The university committee that advises on the ethics of the school\u2019s investments also ruled against a proposal to divest from Israel in February. The committee concluded that \u201cthere is significant opposition in the Columbia University community to withdrawing financial support from Israel, as evidenced by the actions of many students, faculty, and alumni.\u201d In recent months, Columbia has faced pressure from donors on matters related to Israel and protesters. Hedge fund billionaire Leon Cooperman threatened in October to halt donations to the university and called for the school to terminate or suspend a professor who had written favorably of Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack. Cooperman criticized protesters and said, \u201cIsrael is the only reliable ally the United States has in the Middle East.\u201d In April, donor Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, called for the school to end the protests and suggested he would withhold donations because he was \u201cno longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff.\u201d Even if Columbia wanted to divest all its assets with varying links to Israel, the nature of endowments makes that quite difficult, experts told CNN. For example, the university could easily sell shares of individual stocks it directly holds, but investments in index funds would require someone to painstakingly analyze each company in the fund to understand whether ties to Israel exist. And Columbia may lack authority to dictate terms on private equity investments managed by separate partners. \u201cIt\u2019s much more difficult to put restrictions on the indirect investments,\u201d said Luigi Zingales, a professor at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business. Zingales argued pro-Palestinian protesters would probably have more success in achieving their goals if they focused on only a few specific companies in which universities have direct investments, rather than calls for broader divestment. On Thursday, Columbia\u2019s president published an editorial in the Financial Times affirming the university\u2019s commitment to free speech. \u201cWe were unable to come to an agreement but this can not be the end of the dialogue,\u201d Shafik wrote. \u201cThis crisis has also revealed how vulnerable universities are to those that seek to divide us,\u201d she added. As for Khalil, the student negotiator at Columbia, he told CNN that in hindsight he thinks his group may have been too lenient in their negotiation tactics. \u201cWe were negotiating in very good faith. I would have changed my approach regarding that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t regret not reaching an agreement because the agreement they offered was, to us, literally rubbish. It did not have anything, so I\u2019m glad that we did not accept.\u201d With negotiations over, Khalil said he\u2019s focused on strengthening Columbia\u2019s Palestinian community and educating a growing number of students interested in, and supportive of, the Palestinian cause. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a momentum right now,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/business/columbia-protests-divestment-invs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "business"}}
