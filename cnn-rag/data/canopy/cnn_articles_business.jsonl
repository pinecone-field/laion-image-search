{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_business_ryanair-fares-lower-summer", "text": "Ryanair said Monday that it expects airfares during the busy summer travel season to be \u201cmaterially lower\u201d than last year as the low-cost carrier reported a plunge in profits. Europe\u2019s biggest airline by passenger numbers, comparable in size to Delta Air Lines in the United States, said its average fare fell nearly 15% in the April-to-June quarter from the same period in 2023, to \u20ac41.93 ($45.65) from \u20ac49.07 ($53.42). Ryanair\u00a0(RYAAY) attributed that dip in the first quarter of its financial year, in part, to the timing of the Easter break this year, some of which fell over March. \u201cWhile Q2 demand is strong, pricing remains softer than we expected, and we now expect Q2 fares to be materially lower than last summer,\u201d Ryanair\u2019s chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary said in a statement, referring to the crucial July-September period. The airline previously thought fares would be \u201cflat to modestly up,\u201d he added. In a call with investors Monday, Neil Sorahan, the airline\u2019s chief financial officer, said there was \u201ca bit of push back\u201d on fares from consumers, who were spending more cautiously, according to a Reuters report. Ryanair reported a 46% fall in profits in the first quarter of the year, to \u20ac360 million ($392 million), despite a 10% rise in the number of passengers. Shares in the airline were trading more than 15% down at 6.20 a.m. ET, with other European airlines also feeling the chill. Shares in British carrier EasyJet were down 8%, and IAG, which owns several airlines including British Airways, had shed 4.4% by the same time. Ryanair\u2019s latest forecast for fares contrasts with its warning some five months ago that it might have to raise them as much as 10% during the summer, partly because of delays in aircraft deliveries by crisis-hit Boeing. Boeing has been battling a raft of safety and quality concerns in recent months. In January a piece of fuselage on a 737 Max 9 plane, operated by Alaska Airlines,\u00a0blew out mid-flight. Since then, further problems have come to light with some 737s, disrupting Boeing\u2019s production schedule. On Monday, Ryanair said its passenger numbers increased to 55.5 million in the first quarter \u201cdespite multiple Boeing delivery delays.\u201d But it also noted that it had seen \u201can improvement in the quality and frequency\u201d of deliveries from the airplane maker during that period. For the entire financial year, which runs until the end of March 2025, Ryanair expects its passenger numbers to grow to around 200 million from 184 million \u2014 that\u2019s comparable to the roughly 190 million passengers that took Delta flights last year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/business/ryanair-fares-lower-summer/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_investing_global-markets-rise-in-bidens-wake", "text": "Global markets made solid gains after President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential election Sunday and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee. European stocks saw an uptick and markets in the US closed higher following Biden\u2019s announcement. The Dow ended Monday higher by 128 points, or 0.3%. The S&P 500 closed up 1.1% and the Nasdaq gained 1.6%. European markets also closed higher, and Asian markets closed mostly lower. US Treasuries rose slightly, trimming yields, and the dollar was softer against major currencies. Much of Monday\u2019s gain came from a rebound in tech stocks. Nvidia gained 4.8% while chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices was up 2.8%. Shares of CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm behind a crippling global tech outage on Friday, plunged 13.5%. The stock has lost 27% of its value since Thursday. The Trump trade falters Significant doubt about Biden\u2019s ability to beat former President Donald Trump led Wall Street to begin to price in a Trump victory in November. That became apparent with so-called Trump trades, in which investors bought up stocks they believed Trump\u2019s tariff-heavy agenda could benefit \u2014 and they likewise sold off stocks related to green energy and other industries traders believed Trump\u2019s policies could hurt. Meanwhile, a large number of economists have predicted Trump\u2019s policies would\u00a0make America\u2019s inflation problem worse, and he would balloon the US deficit. As Trump\u2019s fortunes appeared to advance in recent weeks, US Treasury prices fell and yields rose, which they often do in anticipation of higher inflation. With the Democratic party now apparently coalescing around Vice President Kamala Harris as its likely nominee, some of those Trump trades could begin to unwind \u2014 or at least go on hiatus until new polling begins to show whether or not Harris appears to stand a better chance against Trump than Biden did. With fewer than 100 days until the US election in November, Sunday\u2019s upheaval could have sent uncertain investors into a worry spiral. But \u201cthe fact that Biden endorsed Kamala Harris reduces uncertainty,\u201d said Jay Hatfield, CEO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. He expects a muted market reaction instead. Uncertainty remains Last week was exceptionally rough for markets. The S&P 500 notched its worst three-day performance of 2024 and Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 logged its worst weekly performance since October, according to Deutsche Bank data. Some analysts worry that market churn could continue as we get closer to the election. \u201cMarkets are increasingly focused on the US presidential election in November,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank\u2019s Henry Allen in a research note on Monday. \u201cBut there\u2019s heightened uncertainty about the outcome, particularly after President Biden has just become the first incumbent President to withdraw since Lyndon Johnson in 1968.\u201d Moreover, the S&P 500 has declined in every September since 2020, he said. Over the last three years, September was the worst month of the year for the index. Still, markets remain unusually strong. The S&P 500 has been higher for 28 of the last 38 weeks, something we haven\u2019t seen exceeded since 1989, he noted. Stocks tumbled\u00a0toward the end of last week as a turbulent election cycle and a global tech outage rocked technology stocks in particular.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/investing/global-markets-rise-in-bidens-wake/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

Selina Cheng, who was elected chair of the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) on June 22, said in a statement posted Wednesday on X that she had been terminated from her job covering China\u2019s car sector earlier in the day. Her London-based supervisor\u00a0at The Journal had asked her last month to withdraw from the election, she added. \u201cThe editor said employees of the Journal should not be seen as advocating for press freedom in a place like Hong Kong, even though they can in Western countries, where it is already established,\u201d Cheng said in the statement. She quoted her supervisor as saying having Journal employees advocate for media freedoms\u00a0would create conflicts of interest because the newspaper reports\u00a0on related topics, including the ongoing trials of\u00a0Hong Kong journalists and media organizations. \u201cI am disappointed if these editors abroad have come to think press freedom is a controversial issue, as those who wish to intimidate reporters might like us to believe,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not.\u201d The HKJA, a trade union established in 1968, has come under increasing pressure from authorities in recent years. Both Hong Kong officials and Beijing state media have accused it of siding with protesters during the anti-government demonstrations in 2019, a charge the association has denied. For decades before the protests, the group was seen as a thriving symbol of Hong Kong\u2019s cherished personal freedoms, which marked a sharp contrast with the highly regulated media landscape in mainland China. But critics have increasingly bemoaned the territory\u2019s shrinking press freedoms since\u00a0Beijing imposed a national security on Hong Kong after the 2019 protests. They cite the closure of multiple news outlets\u00a0and cases of editors being put on trial. Amid a wider crackdown on civil liberties, many opposition figures were rounded up to face trial, with civil groups forced to disband. Cheng said Gordon Fairclough, The Journal\u2019s world coverage chief, flew in from the UK to deliver\u00a0her dismissal in person, explaining that her job had been eliminated due to restructuring. In May, The Journal\u2019s editor-in-chief Emma Tucker announced layoffs in Hong Kong as part of a strategy to shift the \u201ccenter of gravity in the region\u201d to Singapore, she said in an internal email seen by CNN. Cheng said she had survived that round of cuts. A spokesperson for\u00a0The Journal confirmed to CNN that personnel changes were made on Wednesday but\u00a0declined to comment on specific individuals. \u201cThe Wall Street Journal has been and continues to be a fierce and vocal advocate for press freedom in Hong Kong and around the world,\u201d he said. For months, the newspaper has been running a worldwide campaign calling for the release of Evan Gershkovich, a Journal reporter who has been detained in Russia for more than a year accused of spying for the CIA. \u201cThis is why I am deeply shocked that senior editors at the paper would actively violate their employees\u2019 human rights, by preventing them from advocating for freedoms the Journal\u2019s reporters rely on to work, in a place where journalists and their rights are under threat,\u201d Cheng wrote. She plans to continue to lead the HKJA.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/media/wall-street-journal-reporter-fired-in-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_media_secret-service-agents-women-trump-shooting", "text": "In the days following the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, the Secret Service, charged with securing the Pennsylvania event, has faced scrutiny for the extraordinary breach that led to the agency\u2019s worst failure in decades. But one narrative has quickly taken hold in parts of the right-wing media ecosystem:\u00a0The security failure was the result of workforce diversity initiatives and\u00a0women working as\u00a0Secret Service agents. While the security lapse happened outside of the event\u2019s hard perimeter at a poorly secured building roughly 120 to 150 meters away from the stage, prominent right-wing figures have launched misogynistic attacks, blaming the female agents positioned near Trump as well as Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, the\u00a0second woman to hold the top job\u00a0and\u00a0an advocate for women to join the force. In the seconds after shots rang out Saturday, male and\u00a0female agents\u00a0positioned\u00a0on stage with Trump sprang into action to protect the former president with their own bodies.\u00a0But in a series of social media posts and television appearances,\u00a0right-wing\u00a0media pundits\u00a0have\u00a0targeted the\u00a0female agents\u2019 response, claiming they\u00a0lacked the experience, size, and capability to\u00a0handle the situation.\u00a0Edited videos\u00a0that garnered millions of views\u00a0on social media\u00a0as supposed evidence of female incompetence,\u00a0showed a female Secret Service agent seemingly struggling to holster her gun amid\u00a0the\u00a0chaotic scene as a group of\u00a0agents\u00a0escorted Trump to his motorcade. Groups that represent women in law enforcement are also raising the alarm, saying such attacks are dangerous and disingenuous. Matt Walsh, a far-right media personality, wrote a series of posts on the social media platform X\u00a0assailing the notion of\u00a0women working as Secret Service agents. \u201cThere should not be any women in the Secret Service. These are supposed to be the very best, and none of the very best at this job are women,\u201d he wrote. Walsh, who has advocated for traditional gender roles,\u00a0claimed\u00a0without evidence\u00a0that\u00a0if any woman is hired\u00a0in the Secret Service, \u201cit 100 percent means that a more qualified male was passed over.\u201d But those experienced in federal law enforcement note that the female agents on Trump\u2019s detail acted swiftly along with their male counterparts. \u201cOne female agent joined the phalanx in shielding Trump from any possible additional incoming rounds, while another female agent with her gun drawn provided rear security,\u201d said Josh Campbell, former FBI supervisory special agent and CNN security correspondent. \u201cFemale agents were also among those guarding Trump\u2019s armored SUV as it prepared to depart the scene,\u201d said Campbell. Law enforcement experts say there is usually no hurry to holster a weapon, as doing so inherently means a firearm is not required to address a potential threat. The holstering process is also a moment where plain-clothes agents in particular must take care to ensure their trigger does not snag on a piece of loose clothing. Barbara Riggs, former deputy director of the Secret Service, called the criticism directed at female agents \u201cpreposterous, \u201ccrazy,\u201d and \u201cjust outrageous.\u201d The agents on stage acted according to their training, Riggs told CNN, communicating with each other about where they were escorting Trump despite a chaotic scene. They \u201cshould be commended, not vilified,\u201d she said. Right-wing media figures have bashed diversity initiatives for years, making \u201cDEI\u201d or \u201cDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\u201d a slur in the right-wing media ecosystem,\u00a0falsely\u00a0claiming that standards have been lowered to accommodate diverse hiring\u00a0practices. Everything from the Baltimore bridge collapse to safety issues in airliners has been placed at the feet of increasing diversity among the workforce. Women have been part of the Secret Service since 1971. All agents, male or female, must\u00a0meet the same standards to join the force, although women candidates have different physical fitness requirements. By nature, security details are privy to the most personal and intimate details of a protectee\u2019s life \u2013 including\u00a0any\u00a0women being guarded \u2013 and the presence of\u00a0women\u00a0on Secret Service details has been a staple for decades. In the immediate moments following the shooting, audio captured by Trump\u2019s microphone showed\u00a0agents\u00a0taking cover with Trump behind a lectern remained in place at\u00a0the scene until it was clear the shooter was down. But some on the right criticized the female agents as physically incapable of covering Trump\u2019s body\u00a0as he reached in the air to pump his fist in a sign of defiance to his supporters. \u201cHaving a small person as body cover for a large man is like an undersized Speedo at the beach \u2013 doesn\u2019t cover the subject,\u201d X owner Elon Musk, who later endorsed Trump and dedicated millions to his\u00a0reelection\u00a0effort,\u00a0wrote on the platform. \u201cCould be a man or a woman, to be clear, just needs to be large enough to do the job.\u201d But\u00a0even Musk, who travels with personal security,\u00a0has often been spotted with male guards noticeably shorter than him.\u00a0 On Fox News, host Laura Ingraham said that while she supports women,\u00a0\u201cwhen it comes to shielding the body of someone who is six-foot-three \u2026 you can\u2019t do it if you\u2019re five-foot-five. You can\u2019t do it.\u201d Riggs, who retired from the Secret Service in 2006, said the idea agents need to be bigger than the protectee is \u201cabsurd,\u201d noting that throughout the Secret Service\u2019s history there have been male agents of varying heights, which was never an issue. But the security failures at Trump\u2019s rally stem from a building outside of the perimeter that was being secured by local law enforcement, where the shooter managed to reach the roof and have a clear line of sight to Trump. The threat to Trump was not feet in front of him, where the female agents who were most scrutinized were located. And most of the agents with Trump that day were men. One notable voice on the right defended the female agents who protected Trump at the rally. Eric Trump, the former president\u2019s son, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Tuesday that, \u201cThe people on that stage love him. They would take a bullet for him.\u201d \u201cOne of the females on the stage, she was with me for three years.\u00a0I know everything about her. She would take a bullet for me. She would take a bullet for him. As courageous as they come,\u201d he added. \u201cThe same as everybody else that was around him, the head of his detail was on that stage. Believe me, the last thing they wanted was that to happen and they did all the right things.\u201d Still, other right-wing figures blamed\u00a0DEI\u00a0initiatives for incompetence at the federal agency led by Cheatle, only the second woman to head the Secret Service. Cheatle, who has served in the Secret Service for more than 25 years and was part of then-Vice President\u00a0Joe\u00a0Biden\u2019s security detail,\u00a0previously\u00a0led global security for PepsiCo. In a\u00a0CBS News interview\u00a0last year, she said that\u00a0the agency\u00a0had sought to boost the number of women in the force. \u201cI\u2019m very conscious as I sit in this chair now, of making sure that we need to attract diverse candidates and ensure that we are developing and giving opportunities to everybody in our workforce, and particularly women,\u201d Cheatle said. Right wing\u00a0figures also attacked Cheatle\u2019s previous work as head of security at PepsiCo, one of the largest food and beverage companies in the world. Tennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett, who has attacked Vice President Kamala Harris as a \u201cDEI\u201d hire in a \u201cbox checking White House,\u201d\u00a0wrote on X, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that a DEI hire from @pepsi would be a bad choice as the head of the Secret Service. #sarcasm.\u201d On the far-right cable channel One America News, host Dan Ball claimed Cheatle \u201chas been too worried about making sure all of the agents use the proper pronouns\u201d over ensuring the safety of the former president. Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, who sits on the Senate Homeland Security Committee,\u00a0told the Washington Post on Wednesday that he believes Cheatle \u201cwas far more concerned about DEI than protecting, for example, President Trump.\u201d Riggs said Cheatle did \u201cnot get that job as a token. It\u2019s because they bring the experience, and they\u2019ve been successful.\u201d She also defended recruitment efforts, noting that more diversity brings \u201cdifferent perspectives to the table and different experiences\u201d that can help view a situation in a different way, with unique skills, knowledge and abilities. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Whitney Wild on Tuesday, Cheatle\u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cWhat happened is a terrible incident and should never happen.\u201d \u201cAnd we are obviously going to make sure moving forward we take whatever any lessons that come out of this and adjust accordingly,\u201d she added. Associations that represent women in law enforcement reacted to the\u00a0unfounded attacks on female agents\u00a0with disappointment and alarm. \u201cStatements blaming this shooting on efforts to promote gender equity are disingenuous at best and deeply dangerous at worst,\u201d a group of associations, including Women in Federal Law Enforcement, International Association of Women Police, and National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives, said in a statement. Research, they said, has shown that efforts to expand the pool of qualified applicants for law enforcement positions \u201cmakes us all safer and say they do not advocate for hiring solely based on gender or lowering standards in any way.\u201d \u201cWe must reject all bad-faith efforts to seek to score political points at the expense of our safety. This is the most recent effort to sow division and blame by attacking diversity initiatives for everything from airline safety catastrophes to bridge collapse to bank failures,\u201d the groups said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/media/secret-service-agents-women-trump-shooting/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_success_saving-under-high-interest-rates", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is an updated version of an article that originally ran on May 1. As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged for its seventh meeting in a row on Wednesday. People carrying variable-rate debt like credit cards and those seeking a loan won\u2019t be happy given that the Fed\u2019s rate, which directly and indirectly affects consumers\u2019 borrowing costs, remains at a 23-year high. Those rates will likely stay high for a while. At this point, only one cut is seen as likely before the end of the year, according to US central bankers\u2019 latest summary of economic projections. But whenever the cuts start, they may be small. \u201cAbsent a complete about-face from the economy, interest rates aren\u2019t likely to come down soon enough, or fast enough, to provide meaningful relief to borrowers. Utilize zero-percent credit card balance transfer offers, shop around for lower fixed-rate personal loans and home equity loans, and channel as much income as possible toward paying down this debt as quickly as possible,\u201d said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com\u2019s chief financial analyst. But the Fed\u2019s decision leaves savers, once again, in the catbird seat when it comes to making money on their money. \u201cSavers are enjoying the best returns on savings accounts and CDs in more than 15 years, with the most competitive offers outpacing inflation. In addition, these conditions are poised to persist for the foreseeable future,\u201d McBride said. Online high-yield savings accounts The best bang for your savings can still be had in online high-yield savings accounts at FDIC-insured banks, which yield way more than today\u2019s 0.58% overall average savings rate. As of June 11, the average online savings account rate was 4.40%, according to DepositAccounts.com. And many online high-yield accounts continue to offer rates of 5% or more. Say you have $10,000 in savings. If you leave it parked in a regular savings account at 0.5%, you\u2019ll get $50 in interest for a year. If you put it instead in a 5% high-yield account, you\u2019ll get $500. A high-yield savings account is the best place to park money you\u2019ll need to cover emergencies as well as anticipated large expenses that you have to pay in the next three months to a year. As with any savings account, banks can lower the rate they offer \u2014 also known as the APY \u2014 at any time. And you can be sure they will do just that when the Fed looks like it will finally start cutting rates, McBride said. But, he added, since rates are likely to be cut in small increments, online high-yield savings accounts may continue to offer inflation-beating returns for some time. \u201cThey will still offer the best way to preserve your [money\u2019s] buying power,\u201d McBride said. Money market accounts and money market funds Money market deposit accounts and money market mutual funds are generating yields competitive with the best high-yield savings accounts. But there are important differences. Money market deposit accounts are bank products. So, assuming your bank is FDIC insured, your account is too. (Or, if your account is at a federally backed credit union, your money will be\u00a0insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.) As with high-yield accounts, you may get the best deals at an online bank. But money market accounts may have a higher minimum deposit requirement than a high-yield account. Money market funds, by contrast, are an investment product \u2014 they generate return by investing in short-term, low-risk debt instruments and are currently yielding an average of 5.12%, according to the Crane 100 Money Fund Index. Such funds are a good place to park cash you have in your brokerage account that you may want to use at some point to buy equities or bonds, McBride said. Money market funds are not FDIC-insured, but any brokerage you use should be insured by the\u00a0Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which\u00a0covers your funds up to a limit if your brokerage ever goes under. Certificates of deposit CDs are still a great place to park any money you can leave untouched for a fixed\u00a0period of time \u2014 anywhere from a few months to five years or longer. As of June 11, the average rate was 4.971% on an online one-year CD, and 3.815% on a five-year CD, according to DepositAccounts.com. While your brick-and-mortar bank may offer a CD at a good rate, you may get a better one shopping around. The easiest way to do that without having to set up an additional account at another bank is to shop for CDs through your online brokerage, which is likely to offer a wide array of CDs from many different banks. At Schwab.com, for instance, CDs on offer ranging in duration from three months all the way up to 10 years offered average annual returns over 5%, with most ranging between 5.30% and 5.45%. The highest annual average was 5.56% for a three-month CD. If you have to withdraw money before the end of a CD\u2019s term, you can always get all of your principal back but may forfeit some of the interest earned as an early withdrawal penalty. Treasury bills and notes Beyond deposit accounts, investing in short-term Treasury bills and intermediate-term Treasury notes has been another way to earn a competitive return with virtually no risk since Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Treasury bills come in six different maturities: 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 13 weeks, 17 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks. Treasury notes mature in two, three, five, seven or 10 years. \u201cAs long as the Fed holds its rate in the 5.25% to 5.5% range, we expect most Treasury bill yields to hover around 5.25% as well,\u201d said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. But, Martin added, \u201cWhile the timing of rate cuts has been pushed back, we still expect them to arrive later this year, and investors in short-term investments would likely face reinvestment risk.\u201d That\u2019s why he suggests investors consider buying some intermediate-term investments now before rates are cut if they want to lock in a higher yield for some of their money, such as Treasury notes maturing in the next four to 10 years. On Wednesday, yields on Treasury bills were north of 5% and yields on Treasury notes were north of 4%, according to Schwab.com. When deciding whether it makes sense to invest in a CD or a Treasury for the same duration, you might opt for the Treasury if you live in a high-tax state, McBride suggested, since interest on Treasuries is\u00a0exempt from state and local taxes. In all instances, the easiest way to purchase Treasuries and other bonds is to do so through your brokerage account.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/success/saving-under-high-interest-rates/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_success_how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges", "text": "Long before you take your high schooler on college campus tours, consider this: Shopping for college shouldn\u2019t be any different than shopping for a home.\u00a0When you want to buy a home, you come up with a range of how much you can afford and get pre-qualified for a mortgage. Then you look in neighborhoods that offer homes that meet your family\u2019s needs and fall within your price range. \u201cAdopt a mindset that we\u2019re buying college like we\u2019re buying a house,\u201d said Beth Walker, author of \u201cBuying College Better\u201d and \u201cNever Pay Retail for College.\u201d As a financial adviser and certified\u00a0college planning specialist, Walker tries to help families avoid a situation that many find themselves in at the 11th hour: Their child applies \u2014 and gets into \u2014 schools they cannot afford because the schools won\u2019t give them enough aid. And then they just \u2026 try to make it work, no matter how much debt is involved for the parents or the student. Instead, she advises families to start as early as 9th or 10th grade in figuring out what is affordable for them as a family \u2014 so parents don\u2019t sacrifice their own financial welfare and the future college student doesn\u2019t drown in debt upon graduation. And second, she recommends assessing how a child\u2019s talents and interests pare with majors and careers they might want to pursue. Doing both those things can help you target the right colleges to apply to. Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners, defines the perfect college as one \u201cwhere a student can go be happy, safe and successful, graduate in four years or less with a marketable degree and little or no debt.\u201d In helping families align parents\u2019 affordability constraints with their student\u2019s academic and social needs, he cautions them not to automatically assume the Ivys or other high-prestige schools will be best simply because of their status. And he stresses what success in life looks like after college and notes that an Ivy League degree isn\u2019t the only path to achieving it, especially if your child won\u2019t get much aid to attend. In fact, said Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, a lot of brand-name schools don\u2019t even offer merit-based aid, only need-based. So if you\u2019re not rich, but you make too much to qualify for need-based aid, you could find yourself having to cover the entire cost of tuition, room and board every year, which is pushing $90,000 at some US colleges. Set up financial guardrails well before the college search Fothergill created a free calculator called CostHero that lets parents assess what financial resources they will have available to pay for a child\u2019s college education. It then provides a range of affordability: At the low end is the number representing what they can pay if they don\u2019t take on debt. And at the high end is the number they can pay if they also take out an unsubsidized federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). \u201cIf you\u2019re not in a position to write a check for $90,000 a year, put up guardrails for yourself so you don\u2019t blow up your retirement,\u201d he said. The calculator inputs let you set the amount of resources you\u2019re willing to use to pay for college from your income and savings, your child\u2019s earnings from summer jobs, any family gifts, and any federal Stafford loans your child may take. It also factors in if you qualify for the federal American Opportunity Tax Credit. That credit, for qualified educational expenses, will reduce your tax bill or increase any refund you have coming. The calculator also gives you a debt-to-income score like the kind a mortgage lender might use to assess whether you\u2019re a good credit risk. Ideally, he said, you don\u2019t want your housing costs to exceed 36% of your gross income and your total debt \u2014 including debt from housing, cars, credit cards and any parental education loans \u2014 to exceed 43%. If your DTI ratio is close to or higher than 43% that is a sign you could get yourself into trouble if you end up having any financial problems while your child is in college, Fothergill said. \u201cIf folks have a way to determine the range of affordability prior to the onset of the college search, the outcomes are a lot better.\u00a0 For example, if one knows that the range of affordability is between $30,000 [a year] with no parent debt and $50,000 with parent debt, then any college that comes in with a net cost in that range is, by definition, affordable,\u201d Fothergill said. Net cost refers to the true cost of attendance after figuring out how much aid your child may get (e.g., grants and scholarships). Figure out where your student may qualify for the most aid Generally speaking, the biggest tuition discounts go to the most academically accomplished students in an incoming class. \u201cThe student needs to be in the top 25% of those admitted,\u201d Walker said. Getting into that top 25% cohort is based on SAT or ACT scores, and having a high, unweighted GPA based on a rigorous high school curriculum. The curriculum\u2019s academic rigor can be further bolstered by taking AP courses. Since your child is more likely to make the top quartile at some schools than others, Fothergill and Walker both recommend your child focus on applying only to those schools in which they stand the best chances of being in that top group to maximize their chances for merit-based aid. Otherwise, you\u2018ll spend money to apply to guidance-counselor-recommended \u201csafety\u201d schools or \u201creach\u201d schools with no sense if those places are affordable to you should your child get in. Using reported data from admissions officers about their key criteria in admitting an incoming class and based on what more than 1,000 schools report about the qualifications they used to grant aid, Fothergill created another tool called ListHero. It gives students a score that helps gauge\u00a0how competitive their profile is\u00a0at a given school, relative to others admitted, and by extension their eligibility for tuition discounts. Right now the tool is only available to college planning professionals for a fee. But Fothergill plans to create a free mini-version for consumers to use. For parents doing their own research on test scores, GPA requirements, costs and aid, he recommends checking the Department of Education College Scorecard, the site CollegeData.com and the College Board. Other ways to reduce college costs before applying While your children are in high school they can take other steps to reduce the total cost of their education. One way is by doing well on the PSAT to qualify to compete for a National Merit Scholarship. Another is to take AP courses. If their high school doesn\u2019t offer them, there is a program called Freshman Year for Free offered by the Modern States Education Alliance. It provides free AP placement courses and pays the fee for students to take the AP tests or college-level preparation (CLEP) tests administered through the College Board. Getting the minimum AP scores a college requires to earn a college credit will lower how much you ultimately have to spend on tuition. A third option is to see if your state has a program that offers a year of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to a state university from which your child could earn their degree. Or, if you plan to go to any other college, make sure the school will accept the credits from a community college course you plan to take. No matter what steps you take, starting the research and budgeting process early can save everyone a lot of stress, debt and potential heartache in the end. Said Walker: \u201cWe have to be a lot more intentional about this purchase.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/success/how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_success_gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy", "text": "Employees\u2019 negative daily emotions and lack of well-being can ultimately hurt worker engagement \u2013 and the economy, according to a new report released this week. Gallup, in its \u201cState of the Global Workplace,\u201d estimates that low employee engagement costs the global economy $8.9 trillion, or 9% of global GDP. The report includes findings from its latest annual World Poll, which surveyed 128,278 employees in more than 140 countries last year. That poll found that roughly 20% of workers globally reported feeling lonely, angry or sad on a daily basis. And 41% on average say they feel stress. Those most likely to say they feel lonely were younger workers (22%), employees who worked remotely full-time (25%) and those who felt most disengaged on the job (31%). While work isn\u2019t always the cause of a person\u2019s negative daily emotions, employers should still be concerned. That\u2019s because work can either improve or worsen employees\u2019 well-being. On the one hand,\u00a0the Gallup report noted,\u00a0\u201cwhen employees find their work and work relationships meaningful, employment is associated with high levels of daily enjoyment and low levels of all negative daily emotions. Notably, half of employees who are engaged at work are thriving in life overall.\u201d On the other, researchers found that being disengaged at work can negatively affect a person\u2019s wellbeing as much as \u2014 or more than \u2014 not having a job at all. \u201cEmployees who dislike their jobs tend to have high levels of daily stress and worry, as well as elevated levels of all other negative emotions,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOn many wellbeing items (stress, anger, worry, loneliness), being actively disengaged at work is equivalent to or worse than being unemployed.\u201d Engaged managers help workers thrive The poll found that last year only 23% of employees were engaged at work, unchanged from the year prior. Gallup defines an engaged employee as someone \u201chighly involved in and enthusiastic about their work and workplace. They are psychological \u2018owners,\u2019 drive performance and innovation, and move the organization forward.\u201d But those who said they were not engaged rose by 3 percentage points to 62%. These are employees characterized as \u201cpsychologically unattached to their work and company. Because their engagement needs are not being fully met, they are putting time but not energy or passion into their work.\u201d Engagement levels are highest in so-called \u201cbest practice\u201d organizations, where three-fourths of managers on average are engaged as well as seven in 10 non-managers, Gallup said. Their best practices include leaders\u2019 emphasizing well-being at work and in life; and putting a high priority on manager hiring and development. The manager piece of the equation is especially crucial. \u201c[W]hen managers are engaged, employees are more likely to be engaged,\u201d the report said. And, it added, \u201chigh-engagement business units are likely to see significantly higher employee wellbeing \u2014 as well as higher productivity, profitability and sales \u2014 than low-engagement teams.\u201d Where the most and least stressed workers are Engagement and well-being results varied in each of the 10 regions covered by Gallup\u2019s poll. The report noted that the United States and Canada, for example, showed the highest percentage of engaged employees (33%) among all the regions studied; and the third highest percentage of thriving employees (53%), behind Australia and New Zealand (60%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (54%). But the US and Canada also ranked second among employees experiencing daily stress (49%), right behind the Middle East and North Africa (52%). By contrast, Europe showed the lowest level of employee engagement (13%). South Asia scored lowest in terms of employees described as thriving overall (13%). And countries in post-Soviet Eurasia ranked lowest in terms of daily stress (19%).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/success/gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_07_17_business_hsbc-new-ceo-elhedery", "text": "HSBC has appointed its Chief Financial Officer Georges Elhedery as its next CEO, the bank said Wednesday. Lebanon-born Elhedery, 50, who becomes\u00a0the bank\u2019s third chief executive in less than eight years, will replace outgoing head Noel Quinn from September 2. While the 160-year-old lender did consider external candidates, it has traditionally appointed its CEO from within. \u201cFor most investors, continuity is essential, especially after the battles\u00a0HSBC\u2019s board has been through in recent years, to persuade shareholders that its strategy is right,\u201d said Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Elhedery\u2019s appointment comes as HSBC (HSBC) tries to shift from restructuring to growth, at a time when helpful interest rate hikes may have peaked and geopolitical tensions simmer. Iain Pyle, senior investment director at\u00a0HSBC\u00a0shareholder abrdn, said Elhedery had made a good impression on the market over his 18 months as finance chief and was \u201ca clear communicator.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a continuity appointment, but a strong candidate and I think will be taken well today,\u201d he said. HSBC\u00a0defeated a shareholder resolution last year backed by Chinese insurance giant Ping An and other Hong Kong-based shareholders who were seeking a\u00a0spin-off\u00a0of its lucrative Asia business. Ping An, which owns 8.9% of\u00a0HSBC\u00a0according to LSEG data, declined to comment on Elhedery\u2019s appointment. Elhedery\u00a0began his career in banking as a trader before joining\u00a0HSBC\u00a0in 2005. In October 2022, he was unexpectedly appointed CFO just weeks after returning from a sabbatical. It was a move that groomed him for the top job. Quinn, who led\u00a0HSBC\u00a0for five years, will remain CEO until Elhedery starts in the role. At the time of his surprise exit announcement in April, he said he wanted a better work-life balance and planned to pursue a portfolio career. Quinn oversaw a raft of asset sales, navigated the pandemic and a push by rebel investors to break up the bank, guiding the lender to record profit. Stanley Tsai, founder of Hong Kong-based investment advisory firm Antler Capital, said he wasn\u2019t surprised by the choice. \u201cSome investors might\u2019ve wanted someone with more direct Asia experience, especially with the Greater China portfolio, but it\u2019s always been the non-Asia business that has presented the most overwhelming challenges,\u201d he said. That said,\u00a0HSBC\u00a0is highly sensitive to souring relations between China and the West, and\u00a0delivering on growth ambitions\u00a0in Asia will be challenging at a time when China\u2019s economic growth is slowing and the bank risks being embroiled in geopolitical tensions. Elhedery will also have to manage\u00a0HSBC\u2019s exposure to China\u2019s lingering bad loans crisis, which triggered a shock $3 billion charge last February on the bank\u2019s stake in China\u2019s Bank of Communications.

Nearly four in ten (39%) of US adults say they worry most or all of the time that their family\u2019s income won\u2019t be enough to meet expenses, according to a new CNN poll. That\u2019s up from 28% who expressed those concerns in December 2021, and it\u2019s similar to the numbers seen during the Great Recession (37%). To cope, significant shares of\u00a0Americans said they are adding side jobs, cutting down on driving and putting more expenses on credit cards. Even higher percentages of Latino (52%) and Black (46%) Americans said they\u2019re worried most or all of the time about making ends meet, according to the poll. More than half (55%) of those making less than $50,000 a year similarly worry about having enough money to meet expenses. The findings underscore how, despite national statistics that show unemployment is low and inflation is cooling, millions of Americans are hurting from years of rising prices. \u201cThe grocery store is just outrageous right now. But it\u2019s not just that. Everything has gone up. Clothing. My insurance,\u201d said Angela Russell, an Ohio resident who works as a program analyst at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Russell, who has two adult children and three grandkids, said she recently moved out of her rental home in Cincinnati in favor of one in a rural area where the rent is cheaper. Two-thirds of Americans (65%) say\u00a0in\u00a0an open-ended question that expenses and the cost of living are the biggest economic problem facing their family today. That\u2019s down from 75% in the summer of 2022 but well ahead of the 43% who mentioned an issue related to expenses in the summer of 2021. The typical household is spending $925 more a month to purchase the same goods and services as three years ago, according to Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThe pressure is real. Everything is so much more expensive than it was four years ago. It\u2019s astronomical what you\u2019re paying,\u201d said Russell. Inflation is down. Prices aren\u2019t The rate of inflation has eased sharply: Consumer prices increased by 3% year-over-year in July, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That\u2019s a dramatic improvement from the peak of 9% in June 2022 when gas prices spiked above $5 a gallon. Yet many Americans are not really feeling that improvement. Prices are still higher than they were last year \u2013 they\u2019re just rising at a slower pace. And consumers are still trying to catch up to the price spikes of 2022 and 2023. \u201cWe can talk all day about how inflation is moderating but the cumulative impact of several years\u2019 worth of inflation has done a number on household budgets,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. \u201cThe view from 35,000 feet is unemployment is low, the economy is growing and people are spending money. The reality on the ground is moderating inflation doesn\u2019t mean prices are coming down, just that they aren\u2019t going up as fast.\u201d Some good news: Paychecks have also grown over the past three years. Lately, they\u2019ve been growing faster than prices, reversing a years-long troubling trend. Median household incomes are $1,110 bigger than three years ago, according to Moody\u2019s Analytics. That outpaces the $925 more that people are spending for the same goods and services. Side hustles and spending less But not everyone is making more money. \u201cMany have seen their buying power eroded. Even if your income has kept up with prices, you\u2019re just treading water,\u201d said McBride. To get by, many people are being forced to find additional income. The CNN poll showed that 35% of adults say they\u2019ve recently had to take on extra work to make ends meet. Even higher percentages of Latinos (52%), Black Americans (44%) and those under the age of 45 (47%) say they\u2019ve taken extra work. As a result of current economic conditions, most Americans say they\u2019ve had to cut back on spending on extras and entertainment (69%) and changed their grocery buying (68%), according to the CNN poll. Others say they\u2019ve cut back on driving (41%) and they are taking on credit card debt to afford necessities (37%). The share of Americans who\u2019ve cut back on driving is down from 54% in spring 2022, but the shares cutting back on discretionary spending and watching their grocery budgets have seen little downward change over the past two years. Russell, the Ohio woman who works at the CDC, said her pay is at the mercy of the federal budget \u2013 and doesn\u2019t include the bonuses or stock options that people working in other industries rely on. \u201cLiterally everything seems like it\u2019s outpacing what I earn,\u201d she said. Russell has shifted her spending to focus on essentials by canceling most of her streaming services, going to the movies less often and buying candy at Walmart instead of at the movie theater when she does go. \u201cI\u2019ve had to cut back on all the fun things I like to do. I used to go to the bookstore or get magazines. Now, I get books from the library,\u201d she said. The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from June 3-24, before President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race on July 21, among a random national sample of 2,021 adults initially reached by mail, and 407 adults reached by random digit dialing to a sample of prepaid cellphone numbers. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.

{"id": "2024_07_23_business_china-retirement-age-backlash-intl-hnk", "text": "China has announced plans to raise some of the world\u2019s lowest statutory retirement ages as it tries to cope with the consequences of a rapidly ageing population and a pensions funding crisis. Currently, men in urban areas can retire at 60 and receive a pension from state-backed funds. The retirement age for female urban workers is 50 or 55 depending on their occupation. Rural residents in China fall under a different retirement system. Beijing\u2019s plans, announced at the weekend, have already generated a fierce backlash. \u201cIn accordance with the principles of voluntariness and flexibility, [we] will steadily and orderly advance the reform of progressively delaying the statutory retirement age,\u201d China\u2019s ruling Communist Party said on Sunday. The plan, along with some other key reforms, were released in a resolution three days after the country\u2019s leadership concluded China\u2019s third plenum, a major political gathering in Beijing which takes place every five years. Struggling with declining birth rate and an ageing population, China\u2019s policymakers have been talking about increasing the retirement age for over a decade. At the 2013 plenum, a top decision-making body of the Communist Party said that it has become necessary to \u201cstudy and formulate\u201d a policy to delay the retirement age. Eight years later, during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, China\u2019s cabinet included the policy in its next five-year plan, which means changes could kick in before 2025. While the government did not announce any details over the weekend, a December report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top government think tank, estimated that everyone will be retiring at 65 eventually. In 2019, the same think tank had forecast that China\u2019s state pension fund would run dry by 2035 because of its dwindling workforce.\u00a0Years of strict pandemic-related restrictions, which have shrunk the coffers of local governments, could make the pension shortfall even more dire. Early last year, thousands of elderly people protested in several major cities against big cuts to their medical benefits payments, fearing that local governments were dipping into their individual accounts to cover the shortages in the state pension fund. Anger on social media Chinese social media reacted angrily to changes to the retirement age, with many expressing their discontent over the prospect of delayed access to their pensions. Younger people also complained that they would have fewer jobs if older workers stayed in the labour force longer. On Weibo, the hashtag \u201cadvancing the reform of delaying retirement age\u201d has been a top trending topic since Sunday.  One of the most-liked comments said: \u201cPlease be aware: delaying retirement age only means you can\u2019t receive pension until very late. It doesn\u2019t guarantee you would still have a job before that!\u201d \u201cYoung people have a hard time finding jobs, but elderly people are not allowed to retire. What are you doing? How can [you] dare to encourage people to have three children?\u201d another Weibo user commented, referring to the government\u2019s plans to boost China\u2019s dwindling population. The unemployment rate among China\u2019s youth has surged to historic highs after the Covid-19 pandemic. Even after the restrictions have lifted, employers continue to pull back on hiring as the economy slows down. The government\u2019s sweeping crackdowns on sectors from technology and property to private tutoring, once the biggest hirers for college graduates, have eliminated many jobs available on the market.  A structural mismatch has exacerbated the issue, as graduates opt for white-collar jobs over blue-collar ones, while factories struggle to hire workers. Lack of quality jobs could deepen China\u2019s population crisis. Even though the government has relaxed its limit on the number of children allowed per couple,\u00a0launched national campaigns\u00a0encouraging families to have more children, and offered financial sweeteners, Chinese people\u2019s willingness to have children is almost the lowest in the world. The country\u2019s population has\u00a0shrunk for the past two years, with 2023 marking the lowest birth rate since the founding of Communist China in 1949. Last year, China was\u00a0surpassed by India\u00a0as the world\u2019s most populous country. On Xiaohongshu, China\u2019s equivalent of Instagram, the hashtag \u201cretirement age\u201d has also attracted about 100 million views by Tuesday morning. \u201cDelaying retirement age on a \u2018voluntary basis\u2019? Just like the elder generation was \u2018voluntarily\u2019 forced to have only one child or laid off from state enterprises?\u201d said a Xiaohongshu user.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/business/china-retirement-age-backlash-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "nba-rights-deal-match-tnt-amazon-wbd", "text": "Warner Bros. Discovery notified the NBA on Monday that it will pay roughly $1.8 billion per year to match an offer from Amazon to carry a package of the league\u2019s games, setting up a last-second buzzer-beating attempt by TNT\u2019s parent company to retain the broadcast rights to the games. \u201cWe have reviewed the offers and matched one of them,\u201d TNT Sports said in a statement. \u201cOur matching paperwork was submitted to the league today. We look forward to the NBA executing our new contract.\u201d The announcement comes as the NBA moves to renew its contracts with media partners, agreeing to 11-year deals with Disney, NBC and Amazon Prime Video\u00a0for a reported\u00a0$76 billion. Those deals, which were approved by the NBA\u2019s Board of Governors last week, notably did not include WBD, CNN\u2019s parent company, which currently broadcasts the league\u2019s games on the TNT network and Max streaming service. The governors\u2019 signoff on the deals started the clock on a five-day window for WBD, during which it could opt to match the league\u2019s other offers. While NBC\u2019s bid for the package  currently held by WBD far surpassed the current price it pays to air the games, WBD executives have repeatedly underscored that the company retains the right to match other offers, including a new third slimmer package of games won by Amazon. A person familiar with the matter confirmed WBD\u2019s matching offer Monday was for Amazon\u2019s bid, which includes regular season and playoff games. \u201cWe\u2019ve received WBD\u2019s proposal and are in the process of reviewing it,\u201d an NBA spokesperson said. It\u2019s unclear if the NBA will accept or reject WBD\u2019s offer, which the league intended for a streaming partner. In recent weeks, WBD executives have suggested that if the NBA declines to accept its matching offer, it could bring a lawsuit. The months of dealmaking and uncertainty has set off alarms both inside and out of WBD, raising the possibility of Turner Sports\u2019 nearly four decades as an NBA partner and home to the beloved \u201cInside the NBA\u201d show could come to an end. In its statement Monday, TNT said its offer to match Amazon\u2019s deal, \u201cwill allow fans to keep enjoying our unparalleled coverage, including the best live game productions in the industry and our iconic studio shows and talent, while building on our proven 40-year commitment for many more years.\u201d The high-profile deals, months in the making, represent a massive shakeup for the league and WBD, which has aggressively marketed the NBA as a cornerstone of its streaming platform, Max, to woo audiences away from competitors. The first sign of an upending to the carriage rights came earlier this year when WBD\u2019s exclusive negotiating window with the NBA expired in April without an agreement. That allowed other companies to vie for the coveted sports rights, considered by many to\u00a0be\u00a0the crown jewel in WBD\u2019s sports portfolio. As reports emerged that the league agreed to multi-billion dollar offers from other media companies, the fate of \u201cInside the NBA\u201d\u00a0 was thrown into question. In recent months, host Charles Barkley has publicly decried what he believed was WBD\u2019s\u00a0bungling of the NBA deal. \u201cThese people I work with, they screwed this thing up, clearly; and we have zero idea what\u2019s\u00a0gonna\u00a0happen,\u201d Barkley said in May. \u201cI don\u2019t feel good, I\u2019m not\u00a0gonna\u00a0lie \u2014 especially when they came out and said we bought college football. I was like, \u2018Well damn, they could\u2019ve used that money to buy the NBA.\u201d Barkley\u2019s comments came after WBD inked a new five-year deal with Disney\u2019s ESPN to air two first-round College Football Playoff games this season and two additional quarterfinal matchups beginning in 2026, adding to the company\u2019s live sports offerings. The showdown over the NBA rights comes as legacy media companies struggle to retain audiences, with viewers opting to leave cable bundles behind in favor of cheaper, on-demand content. As streaming services like Netflix have continued to attract and further carve up audiences, live sporting events have continuously proved impervious to declines in viewership felt across traditional television. While WBD maintains the rights to the\u00a0NCAA March Madness\u00a0tournament, along with the\u00a0MLB,\u00a0NHL\u00a0and\u00a0NASCAR, the NBA remains crucial to the media conglomerate. The cable channel TNT has built a programming slate around the NBA games, most notably the highly rated \u201cInside the NBA\u201d show featuring Barkley, Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith and Shaquille O\u2019Neal. Asked last week about the fate of WBD\u2019s broadcast rights, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d \u201cMuch of it is outside my control,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/nba-rights-deal-match-tnt-amazon-wbd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "biden-exit-left-right-media-narrative", "text": "The stark political reality facing President Joe Biden, prompting his unprecedented decision to exit the 2024 race, might look different had he enjoyed the support of a blindly loyal, propagandistic news media. While Donald Trump has relied on Fox News and an army of MAGA Media loyalists to endlessly shield him from scandal after scandal, Biden had no such defenses in his arsenal when serious questions were raised about his age and mental acuity. Instead, the president \u2014 unable to conjure up his own version of reality and successfully disseminate it to the masses \u2014 was forced to grapple with the truth and make a stunning 11th hour decision that rocked the country in a political earthquake. The entire affair, which played out in just three weeks, punctured a hole in the claim that Trump and the GOP have regularly peddled: that the news media is in the pocket of Biden and the White House. That obviously has not been the case, as exemplified by the hard-hitting coverage the president has been subjected to since his poor showing last month at the CNN debate. In the hours and days that followed the fateful showdown with Trump on an Atlanta stage, The New York Times editorial board called on Biden to exit the race. The respected New Yorker editor David Remnick penned a blistering piece urging him to step aside. And a parade of outlets like CNN raised questions and scrutinized Biden\u2019s ability to wage an unrelenting campaign and effectively prosecute the case against Trump.\u00a0  Even MSNBC, the progressive cable news channel, did not offer a safe harbor to protect Biden against the crush of criticism he faced over the last three weeks. In the immediate moments after the debate, the outlet\u2019s prominent hosts, led by Rachel Maddow, gave voice to the concerns over Biden\u2019s disastrous performance.\u00a0In the weeks since, those concerns repeatedly found their way to MSNBC\u2019s air, despite a good chunk of the channel\u2019s viewership making it clear they did not want to hear criticism of Biden. \u201cThere has been so much consternation about the fight in the party but also the media coverage of the fight,\u201d Maddow acknowledged Sunday. \u201cWe have talked about all that. And we know people don\u2019t want to hear about it or had strong feelings \u2026. but throughout, even as difficult as it was, it was a good faith fight. It was a good faith effort to try to do the right thing about the country.\u201d  Even as some MSNBC personalities passionately defended Biden\u2019s ability to carry on with the race, a barrage of questions about his political future still found a way through. While right-wing media is now void of antibodies to keep its political system clean and healthy, MSNBC showed that progressive outlets are still rife with them and not absurdly loyal to any one political figure. Contrast how the news media covered Biden\u2019s woes with how the MAGA Media has treated Trump in recent years. In the wake of numerous scandals, two impeachments, the January 6 attack, and a conviction on 34 felony counts, sycophantic talk show hosts such as Sean Hannity virtually never acknowledged the reality of the moment. Instead, they defended Trump, spinning up wild conspiracy theories, and ruthlessly attacking anyone who dared question his actions. But that was not the case for Biden, underscoring the ethical reality that flows through the news media and largely extends to progressive personalities. In fact, in the end, the news media played a notable role in the unraveling of Biden\u2019s campaign by offering a forum for an uncomfortable stream of questions about his abilities to enter the national discourse. Had the news media looked the other way and run cover for Biden, he very well may not have felt the need to abandon his bid for a second term in office.", "source": "http://cnn.com/biden-exit-left-right-media-narrative/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

The relaunched Overstock.com sells a lot of stuff similar to its previous incarnation, including indoor and outdoor furniture, home improvement tools and jewelry, but with a bigger emphasis on closeout and liquidation deals. Its sister site will still use the Bed Bath & Beyond name and continue to operate with a refined focus on home goods and as a destination for registries for weddings and other life events. In June 2023, Overstock.com changed its name to Bed Bath & Beyond after Overstock\u2019s parent company bought the bankrupt retailer\u2019s brand\u2019s name and domain in a failed effort to benefit from its name recognition. A few months later, Overstock\u2019s corporate name was changed to Beyond Inc. The changes didn\u2019t catch on with shoppers, prompting major moves within the company\u2019s management ranks. CNBC host and Camping World CEO Marcus Lemonis was named Beyond Inc.\u2019s executive chairman in February and said in an earnings call that getting rid of the Overstock name was a \u201cfatal mistake.\u201d Beyond Inc.\u2019s attempt at new categories, like family room furniture and large area rugs, on Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s website failed to appeal to shoppers, prompting management to bring back the Overstock website. \u201cThose results reaffirmed our conclusion during the quarter around the specific muscles that both brands can thrive separately while complementing each other,\u201d Lemonis said in a May earnings call. In a more blunt assessment, Overstock\u2019s integration with the Bed Bath & Beyond brand was \u201cbadly botched,\u201d confused customers and sank sales, according to Neil Saunders, retail analyst at GlobalData.

The French group \u2014 which owns Absolut Vodka, Jameson Whiskey, Olmeca Tequila and Beefeater Gin \u2014 announced the sale of seven wineries in Australia, New Zealand and Spain Wednesday, saying it would allow the company to direct more resources to its premium spirits and champagne brands, which \u201cdrive the growth of its business.\u201d The sale to Australian Wine Holdco Limited, a consortium of international investors, will see Pernod Ricard offload 10 wine brands: Jacob\u2019s Creek, Orlando, St Hugo, Stoneleigh, Brancott Estate, Church Road, Campo Viejo, Ysios, Tarsus, and Azpilicueta. No financial details were disclosed. The deal comes after wine consumption globally hit a 27-year low last year, according to an estimate by the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV), an industry group. Pernod Ricard reported a 7% fall in sales for the wine brands it plans to sell in the first quarter of this year, mainly as a result of a decline in popularity of Jacob\u2019s Creek in India and Campo Viejo in the US. Wine drinking has been on a steady downward trajectory since 2018, driven by a decrease in consumption in China and as high inflation has eroded disposable incomes worldwide. Consumers have also been opting for beer and spirits instead, or choosing to forego alcohol altogether due to health considerations. \u201cThe divestment (by Pernod Ricard) makes sense as the segment has been underperforming for a while now and the global wine market is still challenging,\u201d Sarah Barrett, the executive editor of Wine & Spirits Daily, a US-based trade publication, told CNN. Barrett said the sale followed a \u201cwider trend\u201d of large distillers refocusing their portfolios on premium spirits, pointing to Diageo\u2019s sale of its wine business in 2015 to Treasury Wine Estates. Pernod Ricard is also doubling down on American whiskey. The group announced plans last week for a new US-based company, North American Distillers, to further support its American whiskey portfolio, which includes Jefferson\u2019s and Rabbit Hole. \u201cAmerican whiskey is a dynamic spirits category, and our portfolio shows immense potential for future growth,\u201d Richard Black, who will helm the new specialized business, said in a statement at the time. Falling wine consumption globally has collided with severe pressures on wine production, forcing many vineyards in Europe to close their doors. Last year, wine production hit its lowest level since 1961, according to the OIV, as extreme weather and fungal disease hammered vineyards. Waning appetite for wine worldwide has also hit Australia hard, where millions of vines are being destroyed in response to overproduction that has crushed grape prices, threatening the livelihoods of growers and wine makers.

That\u2019s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets. A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year \u2014 the exact date has yet to be confirmed \u2014 carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon\u2019s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth. \u201cThe first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,\u201d Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation. The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia\u2019s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice. One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice. Images of ice \u2014 transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network \u2014 would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon. For NASA\u2019s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable. Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund \u2014 especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated. \u201cBeing able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis \u2014 as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,\u201d said Engelund. \u201cEventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.\u201d It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth\u2019s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing \ufeffspace colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth. NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy. Bell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the \u201cframework for the lunar economy.\u201d \u201cA future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,\u201d Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN. \u201cThis includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.\u201d There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too. If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth \u2014 such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms. \u201cEspecially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,\u201d Klein said.

But after his shaky debate performance last week, in which Biden routinely struggled to\u00a0get his point across, some in the White House press corps say they wish they had pushed harder to tell the story. In June, when the Wall Street Journal published a\u00a0lengthy piece\u00a0on President Joe Biden\u2019s mental\u00a0state, the newspaper\u00a0got\u00a0slammed.\u00a0The White House, its allies, and\u00a0some in the media\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources\u00a0\u2013\u00a0criticized the Journal for quoting mostly Republican political foes on the record, who had a clear political motive to damage Biden\u2019s image. No Democrats were quoted on the record making those allegations, and several Democrats complained their on-the-record quotes praising Biden\u2019s sharpness were not included. The\u00a0Journal defended its reporting at the time. Last week\u2019s debate on CNN laid bare many of the concerns the Journal\u2019s reporting had raised \u2013 that the president has good days and bad days but can sometimes seem to slip up. A New York Times report on Tuesday raised similar concerns by those who have recently been in the room with Biden. The Times reported Biden has more frequent \u201clapses,\u201d although at other times he appears sharp. After Biden\u2019s lackluster performance last week, some are questioning whether the White House press corps dropped the ball on fully covering Biden\u2019s limitations. Biden\u2019s\u00a0age issue is not secret or new. Nearly every media outlet has reported on\u00a0growing concerns about\u00a0Biden\u2019s age well before the debate. The White House in the past has complained that the coverage is disproportionate, and that the media is spending more time covering Biden\u2019s age than his accomplishments as president versus former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies. The media has faced accusations that it has not covered Biden\u2019s mental fitness more aggressively because it wants to prop up the campaign in some way \u2013 an accusation the White House reporters CNN spoke to denied. Several White House reporters\u00a0told CNN that\u00a0the\u00a0coverage\u00a0of Biden\u2019s age and his mental stamina\u00a0should have\u00a0pushed harder. They cited several difficulties in doing so before the debate \u2013 from the obvious political motivations of sources who either want to protect Biden\u2019s image or project a certain image, to the blowback from pursuing such reports, especially from the White House and Democrats. A difficult task Like all past presidents, Biden has good days and bad days. It\u00a0can be tricky to report on something as difficult to define as a person aging, when his opponent\u00a0is a convicted felon, who regularly lies and has threatened to use the government to go after his political opponents. Still, some reporters said the press corps\u00a0could\u00a0have done a better job\u00a0covering\u00a0Biden\u2019s physical and mental state. The failure of the media, one White House reporter said,\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0pushing more aggressively\u00a0into Biden\u2019s abilities after the release of the Robert Hurr report in February, which called Biden a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d Biden\u2019s age was also a right-wing talking point for years, something the White House was quick to point out to reporters,\u00a0which\u00a0may have inadvertently turned off any serious investigation. For example, deceptively edited clips of Biden from the G7 spread widely by right-wing media figures were made to seem as though he was aimlessly \u201cwandering off\u201d from fellow world leaders when really, he was speaking to parachutists who had just landed during a demonstration. \u201cThe right-wing media was calling him senile from day one, and that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cThen whenever you report on the age you were in some ways solidifying, giving credence to some people that were actually of bad faith.\u201d All the White House reporters who spoke to CNN for this piece chose to speak anonymously so they could speak more freely about their relationship with the White House. Keeping the president at a distance Reporters said the White House has not made the press corps\u2019 job easy:\u00a0The White House has put up guardrails around Biden, they say, and\u00a0he does not engage in as many interviews or planned press conferences\u00a0as previous presidents. At those events,\u00a0the press might be able to gauge how he\u2019s doing on the spot, without prepared remarks. \u201cThey keep him at arm\u2019s length, and he rarely does extended interviews,\u201d the reporter said of the White House,\u00a0although he acknowledged Biden has started giving more interviews as of late. Biden has done fewer interviews and formal press conferences than his most recent predecessors, according to data compiled by\u00a0Martha Joynt Kumar,\u00a0professor emerita of political science at Towson University who chronicles the presidents\u2019 interactions with the press. But on quick and informal interactions with the press, like shouted questions on the way to his helicopter or plane, Biden\u00a0as of this week has had 588 interactions, Kumar reports, second only to Trump when compared to recent presidents. But those interactions are not the same as an extended press conference, reporters noted. On Tuesday, ABC News announced Biden would sit down with George Stephanopoulos for an interview, his first since the debate. The White House press shop has also been very \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cfairly successful\u201d in mitigating coverage of concerns over the president\u2019s age,\u00a0said\u00a0another White House reporter who works for a different publication. \u201c[B]erating reporters who bring them reporting about age concerns, bemoaning that it\u2019s all anyone writes about (clearly, it\u2019s not) and often attacking pieces after they run,\u201d the reporter told CNN. \u201cI think that\u2019s left some folks to conclude that these stories are too painful to report or that they should pick their spots more. It\u2019s clear the age stories that have angered the White House (and the liberal Twittersphere) the most.\u201d Alex Thompson, a White House reporter for Axios, said on CNN the day after the debate that \u201cthe White House\u2019s response every single time\u00a0it\u00a0has come up for three-and-a-half years has been to deflect, to gaslight, to not tell the truth \u2013 not just to reporters, not just to other Democrats, but even at times to themselves about the president\u2019s limitations at his age.\u201d Still, this White House\u2019s recent conduct with reporters pales in comparison to Trump\u2019s team, which has done everything from revoking press access to reporters they disagree with, to calling reporters the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d The White House declined to comment. Aging doesn\u2019t happen all at once Aging is also not a sudden moment.\u00a0That makes it trickier to report on. \u201cTo some extent, the decline has appeared to be gradual \u2014 hard to notice from day to day \u2014 and that\u2019s perhaps made it harder for reporters to determine when is the right moment to write something,\u201d one of the reporters said. Just a few days before the debate, Biden held a press conference at the G7 alongside Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelensky that passed off without anything of note in Biden\u2019s demeanor. But reporters pointed out (and have published stories noting) that the president has been using teleprompters at most big events, even fundraisers where in the past he might not have. He has also started to use the lower stairs to board Air Force One. Last year, The New York Times published a lengthy piece on the \u201ccomplicated reality of America\u2019s oldest president,\u201d which looked at some of those accommodations and concerns for his age, but also the moments where he showed stamina and vigor. Some reporters said that there has been a distinct change\u00a0within the last year, and that the press corps should have reported more aggressively on the accommodations made for the president. \u201cI think the press, most of the White House press, did suffer from a bit of lack of curiosity,\u201d one of the reporters said. Look who you\u2019re up against Biden\u2019s allies will often question coverage of the president\u2019s age, questioning why reporters focus on the president\u2019s age and mental lucidity and not on Trump\u2019s\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who, at 78,\u00a0was observed falling asleep during his hush money trial, has made his own major verbal flubs and bizarre statements, and regularly spouts complete falsehoods. \u201cIt makes sense to reflect on this now and ask whether we missed or, really, under-reported the story of Biden\u2019s age and decline. But it\u2019s complicated,\u201d one of the reporters said. \u201cThe fact that the political alternative to Biden is an authoritarian who sparked an insurrection and is a convicted felon does not mean that the press is failing American democracy to focus on Biden\u2019s obvious frailty.\u201d One of the reporters said the media can, and do, report on both. Biden\u2019s allies, however, say too much attention is placed on Biden\u2019s age and not on the threat Trump could pose to American democracy. But the reporters say they can, and should, do both. \u201cJust because you are reporting on Biden age, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not reporting on Trump\u2019s lies.\u00a0 I find that argument silly, and it seems one design towards like producing a certain outcome in the election, rather than like an honest reporting,\u201d one of the reporters said. The outlets that had received harsh blowback for their previous reports on Biden\u2019s lucidity now feel justified. A source familiar with the staff behind the Wall Street Journal\u2019s report said that when the piece first published, the reporters were approached by people with sympathy asking how they\u2019re doing \u201cas if something terrible had just happened,\u201d the source said. After the debate, the reporters started to get messages saying they were right.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/media/biden-mental-fitness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

The resort will throw a farewell event, with doors officially closing this afternoon. That will cap off a weeklong event, in which gamblers were given the opportunity to win part of a $1.6 million cash prize in accordance with Nevada state law. The hotel announced in May it would be closing. Following its closure, the 3,000-room resort will undergo a three-year renovation that will wipe away any markings of the Mirage and its tropical theme. It will reopen in 2027 as Hard Rock Las Vegas, with a soaring 700-foot-tall hotel tower in the shape of a guitar,\u00a0similar to its Florida property. The volcano will be destroyed to make space for new rooms. Opened in 1989 by casino mogul Steve Wynn, the Mirage ushered in a era of luxe resorts for the Strip and was the first resort to have a sidewalk attraction \u2013 the volcano. That prompted the Bellagio and Venetian to imitate the Mirage with its dancing fountains and canals. Architects told CNN affiliate KSNV-TV that the tropical design created by Wynn was meant to resemble an oasis in the chaotic Las Vegas Strip. \u201cNowhere in Las Vegas before you would walk in and there would be craps tables there or there would be a small lobby and then there would be a casino but in this particular facility we said \u2018no you are not in a casino you are in this beautiful tropical engineered place that made you feel good about yourself\u2019 and that is what it was for so many years,\u201d Mirage architect Paul Steelman told the NBC station. Beyond its exploding volcano, visitors likely best know the Mirage best for hosting other quintessential Las Vegas features like the Siegfried and Roy\u2019s white tigers show and a Cirque du Soleil show set to Beatles music. MGM Resorts bought the Mirage from Wynn in 2000 and\u00a0sold it in 2022\u00a0for more than $1 billion to Hard Rock International.

{"id": "2024_07_21_tech_how-ai-helps-companies-set-prices", "text": "It\u2019s hard not to get fired up by how much more everything costs compared to just a few years ago. But people making the same exact purchases as you aren\u2019t necessarily paying the same exact prices as you. This became apparent to me a few weeks ago when a friend texted me that Starbucks was running a buy one, get one free drink promotion. But when I logged in to the app, the offer was nowhere to be found. Why was my friend getting special treatment? It\u2019s likely that Starbucks used artificial intelligence to determine that my friend, if offered a promotion, would make a purchase they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have, whereas I would make a purchase regardless, said Shikha Jain, a lead partner in the North American consumer and retail division at the consultancy firm Simon-Kucher. The system nailed it for me \u2014 just opening the app to check if I had the promo got me to order, and I paid full price. It\u2019s impossible to say exactly how Starbucks\u2019 systems made that correct judgment about me \u2014 though my past shopping behavior and the shopping behavior of similar customers were almost certainly factors, she said. The Seattle-based coffee chain declined to share what feeds into its AI model, dubbed Deep Brew. A spokesperson did, however, confirm that AI is powering the individualized offers it sends customers. This personalized promotion strategy is not unique to Starbucks. Companies are increasingly leveraging customer data, often derived from loyalty programs, in coordination with machine-learning models to customize prices of goods and services based on an individual\u2019s willingness to pay. The end goal: \u201cGet you to buy more items, buy the same items again or to spend more on the same items,\u201d said Jain. The FTC is pushing back On Tuesday, the Federal Trade Commission sent orders to eight companies \u2014 Mastercard, Revionics, Bloomreach, JPMorgan Chase, Task Software, PROS, Accenture and McKinsey & Co \u2014 seeking information on how they allegedly offer surveillance pricing and services \u201cthat incorporate data about consumers\u2019 characteristics and behavior.\u201d The orders seek to understand how technologies like AI along with consumers\u2019 personal information could be used \u201cto categorize individuals and set a targeted price for a product or service,\u201d according to an announcement the FTC published Tuesday morning. \u201cFirms that harvest Americans\u2019 personal data can put people\u2019s privacy at risk. Now firms could be exploiting this vast trove of personal information to charge people higher prices,\u201d  FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement. Revionics\u2019 vice president of communications, Kristen Miller, told CNN in a statement on Tuesday that it \u201cdoes not, in any way, conduct operations related to the surveillance of consumers.\u201d \u201cWe are confident that the FTC will affirm the benefits of Revionics\u2019 AI price optimization software pending its research into this matter,\u201d Miller added. Mastercard declined to comment on the order, but told CNN it would \u201ccooperate with the FTC in this process.\u201d Task Software, which lists Starbucks as a client, did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment along with the other five companies to whom the FTC sent orders. Traditional marketing tactics on steroids Companies are still employing tried and true marketing 101 tactics, like segmenting customers who exhibit similar purchasing behavior and preferences and taking into account, for instance, a shopper\u2019s location and the time of year. Companies have used this kind of information to effectively offer different prices to different groups of consumers. But in the past, they had to cast a pretty wide net to do so, said Jim Presley, senior vice president of US consumer analytics at NielsenIQ, a consumer insights company. That might have involved mailing coupons to homes located in a specific neighborhood or tailoring deals to people who click certain kinds of ads or read certain online publications. Companies have for years tried to target customers by distilling statistics into actual preferences. What\u2019s changed now with the advancements in AI is the level of sophistication and accuracy with which these types of predictions can be made, said Presley. Using AI, companies can now answer questions like, \u201cWhat is this person going to buy next? What do we think they\u2019re going to be willing to pay? Where are they going to buy from? When are they going to buy it?\u201d said Jain. Matt Pavich, senior director of strategy and innovation at Revionics, an AI company that specializes in helping retailers set prices, said its goal is not to tell retailers exactly how much to charge individual customers. Rather, its bread and butter is to provide companies with \u201call of the analytics and predictive scenarios\u201d to figure out prices themselves. (Revionics was one of the eight companies to whom the FTC sent an order.) Instead of waiting for customers to respond in real time to price changes, Revionics\u2019 clients get a toolbox to test out prices in advance. Then, by predicting how much consumers will buy at different price points, Revionics helps retailers manage their inventories. The personalization even extends beyond prices to targeting customers. So, for instance, a notification you receive informing you of a sale may be worded completely differently from a notification another customer receives of the same sale. Mary Winn Pilkington, senior vice president of investor relations and public relations at Tractor Supply Co., told CNN it recently partnered with Revionics because it wanted to more successfully adjust prices to \u201cthe ever-changing market\u201d to \u201cattract and retain customers.\u201d The aim of partnering with Revionics wasn\u2019t to see how high they can raise their prices without turning away too many customers, she said. She noted that Tractor Supply Co.\u00a0does use\u00a0machine learning \u201cto curate specific offers individualized for customers,\u201d\u00a0although\u00a0Revionics is not involved in that\u00a0aspect. This, she said, \u201coften leads to lower prices and better value on the products and services our customers need.\u201d Of course, like my Starbucks experience, it could also very well lead to identifying customers who don\u2019t require promotions at all.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/tech/how-ai-helps-companies-set-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_business_delta-flight-cancellations", "text": "Bad news for passengers: Delta Air Lines canceled hundreds more flights early Tuesday morning, as the problems caused by last week\u2019s global tech outage continued into a fifth day. Worse news: Delta\u2019s meltdown will probably extend through the end of the week. The meltdown has ensnared an estimated half a million people, ruined holidays and travel plans and prompted a federal investigation \u2013 even as Delta flight cancellations and delays are ongoing and far outpacing issues at other carriers. As of 2pm ET the Atlanta-based airline had canceled 466 flights, and Endeavor Air, its regional carrier that feeds its system under the Delta Connection brand, had canceled another 28 flights. The cancellations follow more than 1,250 flight cancellations Monday, and 4,500 flights from Friday through Sunday between Delta and Delta connection. There were more than 1,000 Delta and Delta Connection listed as delayed by FlightAware. The canceled flights by the two carriers represented nearly 70% of all flights within, to or from the United States that have been canceled on Monday, according to FlightAware. No other US airline had canceled one tenth as many flights. The problems prompted the Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to announce the Department of Transportation would be starting an investigation to make sure Delta is following the law and treating passengers fairly. \u201cI\u2019m hearing a lot of things I\u2019m very concerned about, including people being on hold for hours and hours trying to get a new flight. people having to sleep on airport floors, even accounts of unaccompanied minors being stranded in airports unable to get on a flight,\u201d Buttigieg told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cPart of why we were opening this investigation is the scale of the problem,\u201d he added. \u201cOver 6,000 flights have been canceled since Friday, hundreds of flights have been canceled today, and we estimate that more than half a million passengers have been impacted by this.\u201d The DOT said it has received a \u201chigh volume of consumer complaints\u201d about Delta\u2019s actions since Friday. The department said if can penalize an airline for \u201can unfair and deceptive practice\u201d if it finds finds that an airline provided inadequate customer assistance when flights are canceled or travel plans significantly changed. Buttigieg asked passengers with complaints to contact the Department of Transportation. \u201cWhile you should first try to resolve issues directly with the airline, we want to hear from passengers who believe that Delta has not complied with USDOT-enforced passenger protection requirements during the recent travel disruptions,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWe will follow up.\u201d Delta said it cooperating with the investigation. \u201cWe remain entirely focused on restoring our operation,\u201d the company told CNN in a statement. \u201cAcross our operation, Delta teams are working tirelessly to care for and make it right for customers impacted by delays and cancellations as we work to restore the reliable, on-time service they have come to expect from Delta.\u201d The problems stemmed from a software update issued late Thursday night by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike that crashed Windows software. A cascade effect caused problems throughout the global airline industry last Friday. Although most airlines were able to recover and resume normal operations by the end of the weekend, Delta has been unable to fix problems with its crew tracking system, leaving it unable to find the pilots and flight attendants it needed to fly its planes. The problems will continue for at least a few more days, warned Rahul Samant, the company\u2019s chief information officer, in a message to Delta employees Monday. \u201cSo we\u2019re optimistic we\u2019ll get it done,\u201d Samant said in the video message along with CEO Ed Bastian. \u201cThere will be some things as Ed said, that we will do today, tomorrow to get to a better place by the end of the week.\u201d He said the IT staff is working \u201cfeverishly\u201d and \u201caround the clock\u201d to fix the problem. Frustrated passengers and crews The problems left tens of thousands of frustrated Delta customers stranded and unable to return home. Many of them booked other flights that were subsequently canceled as well. A lack of hotel rooms forced many to sleep in airports and wait for hours on hold trying to get through to Delta in an often-futile effort to find a flight. Delta crew members are dealing with similar frustrations. Many have been left stranded in airports far from their bases and homes, unable to be placed on flights because Delta has been unable to locate crews and place them on planes. Some Delta crew members are also unable to get hotel rooms and are sleeping at airports. And airport employees are contending with angry, frustrated customers who don\u2019t understand why their flights are being canceled when crew members are available. Jeremy and Kaylee Jones were married on Saturday and left Spokane, Washington Monday for their honeymoon, they told CNN. Five guests weren\u2019t able to attend the wedding due to flight issues. They arrived in Atlanta early Tuesday morning for a connecting flight from Atlanta to the Caribbean island of St. Lucia. There were no issues with the flights until they landed in Atlanta this morning and saw the flight to St. Lucia was cancelled due to a lack of crew. The next Delta flight to St. Lucia is not until Friday, so they are canceling their honeymoon. The only other option is to be re-routed to other airports, which they believe will have the same problem, and they still don\u2019t have their luggage. \u201cCurrently I\u2019m pretty sour,\u201d Jeremy Jones said. \u201cI get that things happen. This is just shocking to me that a multi-billion dollar corporation would struggle this much to get the ball rolling again.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m thinking the domino effect of flight cancellations are causing people to be stuck here for 5 days. I\u00a0have no confidence in getting anywhere at this point.\u201d This week, Delta remained in the dark about the whereabouts of its crew members. Crew members who logged on to the company\u2019s computer system to sign up for flights received prompts and questions that included: \u201cPlease enter below what airport code you are closest to,\u201d \u201cWhat is your current status?\u201d and \u201cPlease describe your current location.\u201d A person familiar with the airline\u2019s operations allowed CNN to see screenshots of the prompts. Delta declined to comment on the questions it was asking crews. To help fix its staffing problems, Delta is offering crew members premium pay, as well as additional assurances they will be able to travel back to their homes at the end of their work period, according to the screen shots viewed by CNN. The premium pay and assurances would be in place through Friday, another sign the staffing problem may not be fixed for several more days. Delta also declined to comment on these offers to crew members. But a letter from the chair of Delta\u2019s pilot\u2019s union obtained by CNN said that pilots were once again facing the same \u201cunacceptable obstacles\u201d they usually face when the airline has a problem, namely, the \u201cinability to contact the company in any capacity and the feeling that we have been abandoned in the system.\u201d Costs at $163 million - and climbing The service meltdown will cost Delta, both in terms of its reputation and in dollar costs. The meltdown has already cost the most profitable US airline about $163 million through Monday, according to an estimate from Savanthi Syth, airline analyst for Raymond James. That estimate comes from lost revenue and is likely to climb once additional pay for staff and reimbursements for customers are added in. Although the problems Tuesday are not as bad as they had been the last four days, the additional flight cancellations will add to those losses. Delta has prided itself on its on-time performance and customer service. Earlier this month its bragged in its earnings report that it achieved industry-best completion factor and on-time performance, and operated 39 cancellation-free, brand-perfect days. This meltdown is doing some damage to that reputation that will take time to repair. After a similar service meltdown at Southwest Airlines during the year-end holiday travel period in 2022, the airline canceled nearly 17,000 flights, or about half of its schedule, stranding more than 2 million passengers over an 10-day period. That cost it nearly $1.2 billion between the\u00a0fourth quarter of that year\u00a0and the\u00a0first two months of 2023. In addition to\u00a0customer compensation, the airline faced\u00a0additional labor costs\u00a0and lost revenue that continued into February.\u00a0In addition it was hit with a $140 million fine from the Department of Transportation. Delta\u2019s service black eye could also cause it to lose some future bookings from frustrated customers. This past weekend was the busiest travel period of the summer with 90% of the seats booked. That has made it difficult for Delta to find other flights for those customers whose flights have been canceled. Even if Delta was operating all of its flights normally, it would take days to accommodate all its angry, stranded passengers. Rows and rows and rows of luggage Getting those passengers reunited with their checked baggage is going to take many more days beyond that. United Airlines was also hit hard by the computer problem, with more than 1,000 canceled flights, although it was back to near-normal operations on Monday with only 69 cancellations for its mainline operations. In a note to staff CEO Scott Kirby said that the airline\u2019s 26,000 computers affected by the problem had all been fixed and its operations had been normal for the last 24 hours. He said some passengers had yet to be reunited with their baggage, and United is using FedEx to deliver the bags to some of them. At Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, Delta\u2019s headquarters and largest hub, thousands of pieces of luggage are lined up on the floors of baggage claim. The bags made it to the world\u2019s busiest airport but, through delays and cancellations, their owners either have not yet arrived or arrived on a different plane. Delta employees from all different departments and roles across the company were supplementing efforts to help passengers who made it to Hartsfield to find their bags. Arthur Ginolfi, who had flown into Atlanta for a Global Business Travel Association convention after two trips to the airport in Philadelphia over the weekend, was one of those picking up a bag that had arrived on a different flight than he did. \u201cThis is the worst experience I\u2019ve ever had in my 35 years of business travel,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are lines that were unacceptable, there were people that were frustrated. I saw and I heard a lot of sad stories.\u201d He said he thinks Delta needs to be offering more compensation than he\u2019s gotten from the airline so far. \u201cI had to pay for parking for 12 hours, I had to pay for food, I had to pay for tolls,\u201d he said. \u201cI deserve more pros than a $24 gift card.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context and developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/business/delta-flight-cancellations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices", "text": "Actress Judy Garland never recorded her voice to read an audiobook of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but you\u2019ll soon be able to hear her rendition of the children\u2019s novel that inspired the movie nonetheless. Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_economy_car-loan-repos-rejections", "text": "When Greg Cook\u2019s car of 12 years, a 2010 Honda Fit, up and quit on him in May 2022, he knew it would land him \u201cbetween a rock and a hard place.\u201d He couldn\u2019t afford to go without a car: He knew he\u2019d be out of work soon \u2014 federal funding ran out for the Covid-19 response position he held for two years \u2014 and that the job hunt would be challenging because he relocated to a smaller, more affordable (but more remote) town in Oregon after losing his steady performing arts job to the pandemic. \u201cWhen I\u2019m filling out an application, one of the questions I\u2019ve noticed is, \u2018Do you have reliable transportation to get to and from work?\u2019 \u2018Can you commute?\u2019\u201d said Cook, 56. But without consistent work, he feared he couldn\u2019t afford a car. Cook did the math, made a pros and cons list, and bought a new car. He locked in a low rate, but that was one of the few bright spots: Since that time, not only have the dozens of jobs applications been unfruitful; but Cook, like many other Americans, was slammed by exponentially rising prices. His car \u2014 the monthly payment, the fast-rising insurance, fuel and maintenance costs \u2014 takes up a 30% share of his monthly budget. Still, he can\u2019t afford to lose it, so he\u2019s using what odd jobs he picks up and the savings he built for a rainy day to keep current on the six-year loan. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like grabbing a few pennies out of a piggy bank every few days and eventually that piggy bank weighs a little lighter,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there seem to be more days ahead than there are pennies.\u201d Cars or trucks are lifelines for many Americans, but after three-plus years of painfully high inflation and now a slowing economy, they\u2019ve become liabilities. Delinquencies are climbing at rates not seen since the Great Recession, defaults have grown and repossessions have jumped 23% from last year, new Cox Automotive data shows. And buying a car is no cakewalk either: Credit is increasingly harder to come by and rejection rates are spiking. Waiting for interest rates to drop Fewer people are applying for credit and an increasing share are being rejected, according to the June credit access survey released last week by Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The survey, which is conducted every four months, found that the credit application rate slipped to 41.2% in June from 43.4% in February and the overall rejection rate increased to 21.4% from 18.7%. While the increase was broad-based across age groups and credit scores, the area seeing the biggest spike in rejection rates was auto loans, which shot to 18.5%, its highest on record. The one-two punch of elevated inflation and decades-high interest rates \u2014 the latter being a Federal Reserve-induced antidote for the former \u2014 have diminished consumers\u2019 appetites for loans on many big-ticket items. That\u2019s certainly been visible in the automotive industry, where loan originations were down year-over-year throughout 2023, said Jeremy Robb, senior director of economic and industry insights at Cox Automotive. Car sales did pick up a little bit in the first quarter of this year, he said, \u201cbut not a whole lot.\u201d \u201cEveryone\u2019s been waiting and hoping to see interest rates come down,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think we got a little bit of a head fake early this year \u2014 we thought inflation was coming down more quickly \u2014 and people thought rates would come down, but that didn\u2019t really happen.\u201d Lenders are wary One favorable development for the car shopper has been falling prices, especially for used cars, Robb said. Vehicle prices soared in 2021 amid fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic and its jumbling of global supply chains. In their case, the semiconductor chip shortage (a result of manufacturers reassigning capacity to consumer tech because the auto factories shuttered amid the pandemic and lower demand) led to limited production of enough cars to meet the sharp rebound in consumer demand. Although slightly cheaper cars help the affordability equation for consumers and could stir up interest, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that lenders are more willing. Instead, consumers have been presented with a higher bar, including requirements for a heftier down payment and a higher credit score, he said. More restrictive lending typically equates to approval rates going down and rejection rates rising. \u201cLenders are wary of consumer balance sheets and just the overall economy,\u201d he said. \u201cMost economic trends have been OK, but they\u2019re not great \u2026 Lenders don\u2019t want to lend to people if they\u2019re fearful they won\u2019t get their money back.\u201d Job growth has remained steady, but the unemployment rate has ticked up for three consecutive months and was at 4.1% in June, its highest since November 2021. Repossessions are rising Through the first half of this year, car repossessions are up 23% from the first six months of 2023 and 14% from 2019 levels, according to Cox Automotive data released earlier this month. Such a spike, while unnerving, might not appear as foreboding as it seems, Robb said. When the pandemic hit and fiscal stimulus flowed freely in the early months to help prop up American households and the broader economy, consumers were able to stay current on their bills. And many lenders were more amenable to working with customers who fell behind. As the economy recovered, repossessions started picking back up and returning to pre-pandemic levels. \u201cI don\u2019t want to diminish the fact that repossessions are higher and default rates are higher and delinquencies on automotive loan payments are also higher,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a lot of the trends we\u2019re seeing have gotten back a little bit toward normal.\u201d Delinquencies have accelerated at a much greater pace, nearing what was seen during the Great Recession; however, defaults haven\u2019t shown as steep a rise, Robb said. \u201cThere are more people who clearly find a way to make the payments that they\u2019re behind on and get current some way on their loan so that they don\u2019t default,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/economy/car-loan-repos-rejections/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_success_buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage", "text": "Moving somewhere new when you retire isn\u2019t uncommon. But deciding whether to take out a new mortgage to buy a home is a big deal. Much of your financial life is changing as you transition from a steady paycheck to a mix of fixed and variable income and a new lifestyle. So adding a large debt to the picture isn\u2019t an easy call. That\u2019s especially true now that mortgage rates hover around 7% and home prices keep rising. \u201cAny time you take on debt, you increase risk in your situation,\u201d said Illinois-based certified financial planner Jim Stork. More than a third (35%) of homebuyers last year were between the ages of 59 and 98, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Within that group, a majority financed their purchases. Whether taking out a new mortgage makes sense for you depends on a lot of factors, including how to prove to a lender that you\u2019re a good credit risk, plus your feelings about the debt and the ongoing cost of maintaining a home. To get a mortgage, your age won\u2019t be a factor, but your income will be If you\u2019re concerned that you may be less attractive to a mortgage banker because you\u2019ve hit retirement age, know that it is illegal to discriminate against anyone applying for a mortgage based on their age. Lenders\u2019 chief focus will be on your ability to repay your mortgage with your various sources of non-paycheck income. \u201cWhen you qualify for a mortgage, it\u2019s all based on your income,\u201d said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage. That, and of course any debt you have that will soak up your income, but we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. The income sources that lenders consider, absent a regular paycheck, include: Social Security benefits, pension or annuity income, spousal benefits, disability payments, interest and dividends and your 401(k) or IRA. If a portion of your income is not subject to tax, the lender may treat it as worth 25% more. Fannie Mae offers this example: Say 15% of a $1,500 monthly Social Security benefit is tax free. That means $225 of it will not be subject to tax ($1,500 x 15%). And 25% of that amount comes to $56 ($225 x 25%). So that $56 can be added to a person\u2019s qualifying Social Security income amount ($1,500 + $56 = $1,556). If you want to use your nest egg, different methods can be used to calculate how much income it would provide. There is the asset depletion method in which your eligible assets are divided by your loan term. In the case of a 30-year mortgage, that would be 360 months. If your IRA is worth $700,000, that translates into $1,944 per month ($700,000/360). \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to take the money out \u2014 but you can use your assets [to qualify for a mortgage] as if you were going to take the distribution,\u201d Cohn said. Another option: If you are at least 59-1/2, you can start taking monthly distributions from an IRA without penalty \u2014 or a 401(k) if your plan rules permit \u2014 and the lender will count that as income so long as you show that you have sufficient funds in the account to keep taking that same monthly distribution for three years. Once you close on your home, Cohn said, you can reduce or stop taking distributions if you choose. That assumes you are not yet in your 70s when the IRS requires you to start taking minimum distributions, said Mark Luscombe, a principal analyst at Wolters, Kluwer Tax & Accounting. Burdened by debt? Lenders will also assess your debt-to-income ratio, because no matter how much income you have, the big question is how much of it will be consumed by your debts. The debt portion is composed of your expected mortgage payment plus any credit card, student loan, car loan or other outstanding debt you may have. Generally speaking, for conventional loans your DTI ratio can be up to 50%, Cohen said. That ratio falls to between 43% and 45% if you\u2019re taking out a jumbo loan, she added. A jumbo loan exceeds the conforming loan limits in the area you want to buy. But ideally your debt level will fall well below these top limits, both for the lender\u2019s sake and yours. And, of course, the higher your credit score, the better the interest rate you can get on a mortgage. What you should consider before taking out a mortgage Even before seeking a mortgage, get a good grasp on your expected monthly income and expenses in retirement. Compared to pre-retirement earnings, \u201cMost (new retirees) see a decrease in income,\u201d said certified financial planner Lori Trawinski, director of finance and employment at AARP. While some expenses may also decline \u2014 e.g., work-related costs like commuting \u2014 others may increase over time, Trawinski said, like medical costs, property taxes, home insurance and utilities. Of course, you can downsize and move to a lower-cost area. But if you stay near where you lived during your career, your expenses are likely to rise over time. Also, Trawinski noted, if you\u2019re married, consider what will happen to your household income when one spouse dies. This will help you assess your future comfort level in carrying a mortgage. \u201cPeople often fail to plan for the death of a spouse. You can take a big hit to your income when that happens,\u201d she said. If you do move to a new state or region, weigh renting first. You can get a better sense of the cost of living in the area and decide whether it\u2019s a good fit for you. As Stork put it, \u201cFlorida in August is not as fun as Florida in January.\u201d How much are you really willing to take on? All the usual financial decisions that go into homebuying apply no matter your age. But, in retirement especially, you don\u2019t want to take on more debt than necessary, since the cost of a mortgage is fixed, but the returns on your investments, the housing market and your health needs are variable. At the very least, Stork said, consider whether you can put enough money down \u2014 at least 20% \u2014 to avoid having to pay private mortgage insurance. Beyond that, consider whether you feel comfortable keeping up \u2014 and paying for \u2014 maintenance on a home. Maintenance might amount to 2% a year of your home\u2019s value, Stork said. That amounts to $10,000 a year on a $500,000 home. Maintenance is essential in preserving the value of your house should you ever decide to sell. How would your mortgage interest rate compare to a reasonable rate of return on your investments? The decision to get a mortgage was a lot easier for retirees when rates were historically low \u2014 roughly 3% \u2014 and their nest eggs were earning a lot more. \u201cBut at today\u2019s rates it\u2019s a much harder calculation,\u201d Stork said. This is especially the case if you\u2019re a very conservative investor. \u201cIf your CDs are earning 4% and a mortgage would cost you 7%, you will lose money every day on that decision,\u201d Stork explained. To get the truest reading on what makes financial sense, compare mortgage expenses to your investment returns on an after-tax basis, Stork noted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/success/buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_07_17_media_morning-joe-backlash-nbc-comcast-executives", "text": "Cesar Conde has found himself \u2014 yet again \u2014 on the receiving end of a stinging on-air rebuke from his high-wattage MSNBC stars. For the second time in only a few months, questions about the NBC News Group chairman\u2019s leadership were raised in extraordinary fashion, with the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d team on Tuesday publicly expressing dismay that NBC brass had the day before pulled their broadcast from the air in wake of the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. Joe Scarborough, speaking alongside co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Willie Geist, offered viewers a peek behind the curtain into the conspicuous decision-making process that transpired over the weekend. Scarborough said that the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d team had been informed Sunday evening that all of MSNBC\u2019s opinion-oriented dayside lineup would be pre-empted for a single NBC News feed covering the attempt on Trump\u2019s life. But, as Scarborough noted, \u201cThat did not happen.\u201d Instead of high-profile NBC News anchors, such as Lester Holt and Savannah Guthrie, anchoring special coverage, MSNBC aired two hours of \u201cMSNBC Reports\u201d and two hours of its streaming service\u2019s programming, NBC News Now. And oddly enough, no other MSNBC shows were pre-empted. Only \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know why that was that didn\u2019t happen. Our team was not given a good answer as to why that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Scarborough said. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Scarborough, who said the entire \u201cMorning Joe\u201d team was \u201cvery surprised\u201d and \u201cvery disappointed\u201d in the turn of events spurred by NBC brass, even went as far to offer network leadership an ultimatum. \u201cNext time we are told there is going to be a news feed replacing us, we will be in our chairs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the news feed will be us, or they can get somebody else to host the show.\u201d While the top-rated, largely unscripted show has long been a must-watch for politicos in the Acela Corridor, the program has taken on additional significance in recent weeks, airing major news-making live interviews with President Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and others as the president battles to continue his campaign. Without \u201cMorning Joe\u201d airing on Monday, viewers rebelled against MSNBC, opting to change the channel, Nielsen data indicated. During the four-hour block, the total audience was down 40%, and the demo plunged nearly 50%, compared to this year\u2019s average. Spokespeople for NBC News Group and MSNBC did not directly respond to Scarborough\u2019s Tuesday remarks. But the flare up represented another embarrassing moment for Conde in which behind-the-scenes tension between MSNBC and NBC News Group found its way into the public view. It also raised questions about the progressive news network\u2019s editorial decisions and independence, particularly as Trump and his allies target its parent company, Comcast.  The move to bench the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d crew, after all, didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. Over the course of the last year, Trump has assailed Brian Roberts, the Comcast chairman, applying pressure on him over his distaste for coverage from MSNBC. In November, Trump called Roberts a \u201cslime ball\u201d and declared the government \u201cshould come down hard on them\u201d and \u201cmake them pay\u201d for their supposedly \u201cillegal political activity.\u201d\u00a0  \u201cMuch more to come, watch!\u201d Trump wrote at the time, a not-so-veiled threat.  Those attacks on Comcast were revived in the immediate aftermath of the Trump assassination attempt. Trump\u2019s allies leveled attacks against MSNBC, accusing the network in bad faith of radicalizing Trump\u2019s critics and, thus, creating an environment that led to the shooting. (It should be noted that, at this time, authorities have not determined the shooter\u2019s motive.) At the RNC this week, attacks on MSNBC have been in vogue, with GOP figures such as Donald Trump Jr. and Sarah Huckabee Sanders singling out the outlet and bashing it.\u00a0   Suffice to say, Roberts and the Comcast team, which will potentially have M&A business before the next presidential administration, probably do not wish to find themselves on Trump\u2019s enemies list. A spokesperson for Comcast did not comment Tuesday when asked whether Roberts has weighed in on any of NBC News Group\u2019s recent programming decisions. Regardless, it\u2019s not difficult to imagine that he been irked by the situation at MSNBC, a small slice of the business at Comcast, that continues to cause headaches. Which is why, perhaps, Comcast is involved in cleaning up the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d mess. I\u2019m told that the company\u2019s president, Mike Cavanagh, rescheduled meetings on Tuesday to grapple with the fallout stemming from the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d commentary. While this particular episode will almost certainly blow over soon enough, the underlying issues are likely to remain. Without strong leadership atop NBCU News Group \u2014 leadership that is truly respected by staff \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine that such eruptions from talent will miraculously come to a halt. If anything, the staff at 30 Rock might feel more empowered to speak out against network brass after the events of the last few months. And that can\u2019t bode well for Conde, who must be standing on thinning ice as it becomes more evident he is struggling to manage the increasingly vocal personalities who, at least on paper, report to him.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/media/morning-joe-backlash-nbc-comcast-executives/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_economy_donald-trump-jerome-powell", "text": "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would not fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell if the former president wins the election in November, according to a Bloomberg interview published Tuesday. But Trump\u2019s statement wasn\u2019t exactly a promise, saying he\u2019d let Powell finish up his second term, \u201cespecially if I thought he was doing the right thing.\u201d Of course, his statement also assumes it would be technically possible for a sitting president to oust any Fed official. Powell, a registered Republican, was first tapped to helm the central bank by Trump in 2017. Trump sang Powell\u2019s praises at the time, saying \u201che\u2019s strong, he\u2019s committed, he\u2019s smart.\u201d Trump doesn\u2019t have that same rosy view of his central bank appointee any more and has repeatedly attacked the current Fed chief, even accusing him earlier this year of planning to cut interest rates just to help Democratic politicians win elections (though there isn\u2019t any evidence of that). The former president has made it clear he will not reappoint Powell if he clinches the White House in November. Trump\u2019s ire toward Powell goes as far back as 2018 when the Fed raised rates, which sparked chatter even then as to whether or not Trump could even fire Powell. However, if Trump changes his mind outright because he thinks Powell isn\u2019t doing \u201cthe right thing\u201d and does try to remove him, it could kick off a messy uphill battle. The law states that a sitting president can dismiss any Fed official, but only for \u201ccause,\u201d not because of policy differences. That still wouldn\u2019t stop Trump from pushing to oust Powell before the Fed head\u2019s term concludes in 2026. Powell\u2019s willingness to fight back through the courts would also be key in determining whether or not a president does have the power to fire the Fed chair, which would eventually reach the nation\u2019s highest court. \u201cOne of the few Supreme Court precedents on the president\u2019s authority to fire a member of a body created by Congress came from William Humphrey, an aggrieved conservative commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission, who was fired by Franklin Roosevelt in 1933 over policy differences,\u201d the Brookings Institution wrote in a 2018 analysis. \u201cHe sued for reinstatement and even though he died while the litigation was pending, the Supreme Court still\u00a0took up\u00a0his case. (This is why the case is called\u00a0Humphrey\u2019s Executor: His estate carried on after Mr. Humphrey\u2019s demise.) The estate won. The Supreme Court would have to decide whether the same logic applies to the chair of the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors.\u201d The Fed is an independent government institution, guided by its two mandates of price stability and maximum employment. It answers to Congress, not the US president, according to the law that established the central bank. The only influence the president has over the Fed is the ability to appoint the seven officials who serve on the central bank\u2019s board of governors, including the chair, which is still subject to approval by the US Senate.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/economy/donald-trump-jerome-powell/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

Some supporters of former President Donald Trump \u2013 the Republican nominee in the November election \u2013 even suggested Biden was the victim of a coup. Meanwhile, a slew of slickly edited pro-Harris videos quickly proliferated on social media as her backers tried to capitalize on the moment. The vitriol and counter-punches are a likely preview of the final three months of the presidential campaign, where a furious battle to shape and smear Harris\u2019 image will play out at a moment where social media platforms have weakened guardrails on disinformation. \u201cAs Kamala Harris becomes increasingly likely to be the presumptive presidential nominee for the Democratic Party and gains more public spotlight, the corresponding amount of disinformation and misleading rhetoric will grow exponentially,\u201d Erik Nisbet, a professor at Northwestern University\u2019s School of Communication, told CNN. On X, owner Elon Musk fanned an antisemitic conspiracy theory by replying to a photo of Harris and Alexander Soros, son of the billionaire megadonor George Soros, by suggesting that Harris would be a \u201cpuppet\u201d of the Soros family. Musk endorsed Trump this month and has been pumping out pro-Trump content to his roughly 190 million followers. Photoshopped images of Harris also circulated. One image of Harris posing with her husband had been edited to make it appear like the vice-president had posed with Jeffrey Epstein, the deceased financier and accused sex trafficker. On X, the hashtag \u201cShe\u2019s Indian\u201d was trending in the hours after Biden\u2019s announcement, with\u00a0some users advancing a false\u00a0\u00a0smear of Harris that she is \u201cnot\u00a0Black\u201d (Harris\u2019 mother\u00a0was born\u00a0in\u00a0India and her father\u00a0was born\u00a0in Jamaica). A review by social media analytics firm PeakMetrics of nearly 175,000 posts on X between 6 and 7 pm ET on Sunday that mentioned Harris in relation to Biden\u2019s announcement found that 8.3% of the posts used \u201cracialized\u201d language in referring to Harris, while 4.5% posts used \u201csexualized\u201d language. Biden\u2019s likeness was also exploited in the aftermath of his announcement, which came via a post on social media and not televised address. A fake expletive-laden video purportedly of Biden announcing his decision to leave the race began circulating on X. PBS News, whose logo was featured in the video, issued a statement describing the video as a \u201cdeepfake,\u201d adding, \u201cPBS News did not authorize the use of this video and we do not condone altering news video or audio in any way that could mislead the audience.\u201d On TikTok, pro-Harris videos surged, many referencing a coconut meme that has become synonymous with support of her candidacy. (In 2023, Harris gave a speech on advancing opportunities for Hispanic Americans that included a line that she attributed to her mother about understanding the context of young people\u2019s lives: \u201cYou think you just fell out of a coconut tree?\u201d) One TikTok video, a round-up of Harris memes, had over 712,000 likes and 73,000 shares. Harris\u2019 team has also embraced a viral post from British pop singer Charli XCX that referred to Harris as \u201cbrat,\u201d a concept that includes women and queer empowerment. Russian state media was also quick to react to Biden\u2019s decision to drop out. Sputnik, one of a number of pro-Kremlin mouthpieces, falsely suggested in a tweet that Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0had been a \u201ccurse\u201d on Biden. \u201cI don\u2019t think Kremlin-aligned accounts will drive conversations related to this news,\u201d Joseph Bodnar, a researcher who tracks pro-Kremlin media, told CNN. \u201cBut they\u2019re certainly happy to boost divisive domestic narratives.\u201d Foreign operatives will have a hard time outpacing the real-life twists and turns around the US presidential campaign, according to some experts. \u201cImagine being a foreign disinfo/information operations actor trying to compete with the actual news this election cycle,\u201d quipped Shane Huntley, a cyber threat intelligence expert at Google, on X.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/business/misinformation-kamala-harris/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

How did the crash unfold? Which systems have recovered, and which ones are still affected? We break it down. (All times Eastern Time.) Late Thursday night and early Friday, 911 centers and transportation services are disrupted Overnight on Thursday and into Friday, several states, including Alaska and Arizona, experience 911 service outages. Some hospitals also begin experiencing technology issues overnight, according to nurses on shift. Between 2 and 3 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration announces that all Delta and American Airlines flights are grounded. Several minutes later, the FAA says flights from United and Allegiant Airlines have been grounded regardless of their destination. Spirit Airlines says its flight reservation system has also been affected by the outage. A few hours later, between 5 and 6 a.m., public transit systems in the Northeast begin announcing that they have been impacted. Washington, DC, public transportation services \u2014 including trains and buses \u2014 begin experiencing delays, according to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. In New York City, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, North America\u2019s largest transportation network, says customer information systems have gone temporarily offline, but train and bus services remain unaffected. At 5:30 a.m., US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike tells customers that it was \u201caware of reports of crashes\u201d of its software on Microsoft Windows operating systems, according to a company advisory viewed by CNN.\u00a0CrowdStrike\u2019s cybersecurity software \u2014\u00a0used by numerous Fortune 500 companies \u2014\u00a0detects and blocks hacking threats. Between 6 and 7 a.m., the White House investigates and global banks report issues Between 6 and 7 a.m.: A White House National Security Council spokesperson tells CNN they are \u201caware of the incident and are looking into the issue and impacts.\u201d A White House source familiar with the matter tells CNN there are no indications at this time of malicious activity, though the administration is still investigating. Global banks start reporting some service disruptions, including Australia\u2019s Commonwealth Bank, South Africa\u2019s Capitec, and the Bank of Israel. Australian lenders ANZ and Westpac were also impacted, according to Downdetector, a website that tracks cyber outages. Downdetector has also reported issues for New Zealand\u2019s ASB Bank. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler issues an emergency declaration in response to the outage that affected Bureau of Emergency Communication\u2019s Computer Aided Dispatch system that is used for fielding emergency calls. The bureau begins taking calls manually, according to the mayor\u2019s office. Meanwhile, United Airlines announces that it is resuming \u201csome flights.\u201d Between 8 and 9 a.m., some flights resume but airports brace for a busy day Delta Air Lines resumes some flight departures and issues travel waivers to affected customers. A spokesperson for Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield Jackson International Airport said that systems were operational and the airport put in place additional customer service personnel to address the challenges they\u2019re facing. The spokesperson urged customers to \u201chave patience. We\u2019re trying to have grace and patience with all of the passengers. We\u2019re asking the same.\u201d Later Friday morning, Charlotte Douglas International Airport, an American Airlines hub, advises passengers to not go to the airport \u201cunless they have confirmed their flight information with the airline.\u201d Officials at Miami International Airport, another American Airlines hub, likewise warn travelers that US Customs and Border Protection operations have been affected nationwide, \u201cso international passenger arrivals are currently being processed manually at a slower pace.\u201d Between 9 a.m. and noon, federal agencies get involved and Biden is briefed A little before 9 a.m., Alaska State Troopers and Phoenix Police Department in Arizona say that service at its 911 centers are once again operational after emergency and non-emergency call centers were impacted. Portland\u2019s Computer Aided Dispatch system also comes back online at 9 a.m. \u201cAt no time was the community\u2019s ability to make 911 calls impacted,\u201d the mayor\u2019s office says in a news release. \u201cThe critical, life-saving services of public safety bureaus, including Police and Fire & Rescue, continue.\u201d The Federal Communications Commission announces it is working with federal agencies to provide assistance and determine the extent of the outage after it was made aware of \u201creports of a systems outage causing disruptions in service, including 911.\u201d President Joe Biden is briefed on the CrowdStrike outage and his team is in touch with CrowdStrike and impacted entities, says a White House official. The president\u2019s team is also engaged with agencies \u201cto get sector by sector updates throughout the day and is standing by to provide assistance as needed,\u201d according to the official. Around this time, an increasing number of federal agencies begin getting involved and reporting service disruptions. The US Department of Homeland Security says in a statement on X they are \u201cworking with CrowdStrike, Microsoft and our federal, state, local and critical infrastructure partners to fully assess and address system outages.\u201d Social Security offices close to the public, as the agency warns the public that \u201clonger wait times on our national 800 number are expected.\u201d In an internal memo viewed by CNN, the US Department of Justice says it is feeling some impact from the technology outage and, while it\u2019s working on workarounds, notes it does not have an \u201cestimated restoration time.\u201d Mail carriers UPS and FedEx tell CNN they were also impacted by the outage. UPS says its airline is operational and its drivers are on the roads, but there may be some service delays. A little after 11 a.m., CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz says in a post on X, the firm \u201c(understands) the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,\u201d adding that the incident was not a cyber attack, and that customers\u2019 data remains protected. \u201cThe issue has been identified and a fix has been deployed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was an issue with a Falcon content update for Windows Hosts.\u201d Late morning through early afternoon: canceled doctors and DMV appointments The Massachusetts Department of Transportation announces that some Registry of Motor Vehicle operations are impacted. Other states also report impacts to their driving services, including Georgia, North Carolina, Texas and Tennessee. Around the same time, several of the nation\u2019s healthcare and hospital systems announce they have been impacted by the global outage, including Mass General Brigham hospital system in Massachusetts, Penn Medicine in Pennsylvania, Northwell Health in New York, and Emory Healthcare in Atlanta. While some hospitals report delays in services, others cancel some non-urgent surgeries and medical office visits. Several cancer centers, including Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and New York\u2019s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center say they have paused certain procedures and scheduled appointments. In British Columbia, the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) announces its health system has been impacted, and is working on implementing contingency plans in order to ensure care for patients. Late afternoon sees more medical disruptions Around 4 p.m., New York Blood Center, a supplier of blood to approximately 200 hospitals in the Northeast United States, says it has put in place an emergency driving operation to distribute blood. \u201cThe test tubes are not making it onto planes from yesterday and today, requiring for us to drive them,\u201d New York Blood Center\u2019s senior vice president Andrea Cefarelli told CNN in a phone call. \u201cThere is going to be a 12-24 hour delay in getting the test results.\u201d Blood Centers of America, which rely on shipping companies like FedEx, says it is experiencing delays in reporting test results.\u00a0Executive Vice President Jenny Ficenec says blood usage may be down due to hospitals canceling elective surgeries, so the delay should not cause any shortages unless the problem persists. Blood\u00a0Assurance, which provides blood to hospitals in a number of Southeast states, including Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia, says its planned shipment of at least 20\u00a0platelets has been postponed due to flight delays and cancellations caused by the outage. \u201cWe are asking community members to help through donation,\u201d\u00a0Blood\u00a0Assurance says in an email to CNN. \u201cWe have a fantastic community of donors that always shows up when we need them.\u201d Meanwhile, CrowdStrike CEO Kurtz takes to social media again and promises customers \u201cfull transparency\u201d on how the global IT outage involving the company\u2019s software occurred. CrowdStrike would take steps \u201cto prevent anything like this from happening again,\u201d according to a statement on the company\u2019s website. Saturday morning: massive flight delays In a statement Saturday morning, Microsoft estimates the outage affected 8.5 million Windows devices. That\u2019s less 1% of all Windows machines, according to Microsoft, but the company adds that \u201cthe broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services.\u201d Various sectors are still feeling the aftershocks of the outage. Although airlines have largely resumed services, many tell customers that they expect disruptions in schedules to continue. As of noon on Saturday, at least 3,375 flights across the United States have been delayed and more than 1,200 canceled, according to data from flight tracker FlightAware. Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the nation\u2019s busiest airport, remains the most affected.

{"id": "2024_07_22_media_us-russian-journalist-sentenced-to-6-5-years-in-jail-after-swift-secret-trial-in-russia", "text": "A Russian court has sentenced Alsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-American journalist, to six-and-a-half years in prison, state news agency TASS reported Monday. The hearing, which was held behind closed doors, found Kurmasheva guilty of spreading false information about the Russian army, making her just the latest US journalist to be convicted in the country in recent months. Kurmasheva\u2019s charge was handed down in the city of Kazan on Friday, the same day that a court in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg convicted Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich of espionage and sentenced him to 16 years in prison, following a trial condemned by his newspaper and the United States as a sham. The convictions of Kurmasheva and Gershkovich on the same day \u2013 both in rapid, closed-door trials \u2013 have raised questions about whether the Kremlin is intending to use journalists in a prisoner swap with the US. When asked about this possibility earlier Monday, spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \u201cI have no answer to this question. I leave this question unanswered.\u201d Kurmasheva, a Prague-based journalist for the US-backed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), was detained in October 2023 after allegedly failing to register as a foreign agent, while on a trip to visit her mother in Russia. She was formally accused of spreading false information in December \u2013 charges her family and employer deny. RFE/RL CEO Stephen Capus called Kurmasheva\u2019s conviction \u201ca mockery of justice\u201d and demanded her immediate release. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond time for this American citizen, our dear colleague, to be reunited with her loving family,\u201d Capus said in a statement, adding that \u201cthe only just outcome is for Alsu to be immediately released from prison by her Russian captors.\u201d Pavel Butorin, Kurmasheva\u2019s husband, reacted to the court\u2019s decision, telling CNN: \u201cMy daughters and I know Alsu has done nothing wrong. And the world knows it too. We need her home.\u201d Before her conviction, Butorin told CNN he was \u201cso confident that she would get back to us that I bought Taylor Swift tickets\u201d for August this year. \u201cLittle did we know that she would be arrested and taken away from us.\u201d Butorin told CNN that Kurmasheva had traveled to Russia to see her mother in May 2023, but was detained at the airport when trying to return home to Prague in early June. After her passports were taken, she was fined and placed under de facto \u2013 and then formal \u2013 house arrest for months, before being charged in December. Butorin had asked that the US government also declare Kurmasheva as wrongfully detained, as it has done for Gershkovich \u2013 the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Monday called for Kurmasheva to be released. Speaking at a State Department briefing, Miller called Kurmasheva a \u201cdedicated journalist who is being targeted by Russian authorities for her uncompromising commitment to speaking the truth and her principled reporting.\u201d \u201cJournalism is not a crime, as you have heard us say on a number of occasions, and we continue to make very clear that she should be released,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/media/us-russian-journalist-sentenced-to-6-5-years-in-jail-after-swift-secret-trial-in-russia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_07_22_economy_democratic-nominee-2024-economy", "text": "With his exit from the presidential race, President Joe Biden has set the stage for his Democratic successor to answer for the country\u2019s post-pandemic economic recovery. Biden\u2019s statement, posted on X Sunday afternoon, touted his administration\u2019s economic policies. \u201cToday, America has the strongest economy in the world,\u201d he wrote, adding that \u201cwe overcame \u2026 the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\u201d While the economic outlook appears somewhat more promising than the one Biden inherited in 2021, the economy is still a mixed bag, and the new Democratic nominee will have to navigate a precarious landscape ahead of the November election. Jobs remain stable so far this year The labor market remains reassuringly steady, even as job gains cooled modestly last month. The US economy\u00a0added 206,000 jobs in June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported July 5, a small dip from May\u2019s tally of 215,000 jobs. The economy remains historically strong. June marked the economy\u2019s 42nd consecutive month of job growth, the fifth-longest employment expansion on record. The unemployment rate moved slightly higher, up 0.1 percentage points to 4.1%. That marked the first time since November 2021 that the jobless rate was above 4% and also the third consecutive month that the unemployment rate increased. Job opportunities, while still above pre-pandemic levels, have shrunk, and Americans have remained unemployed for longer. The\u00a0median duration of unemployment\u00a0jumped higher \u2014 to 9.8 weeks from 8.9 weeks \u2014 and landed at a level not seen since January 2023, BLS data showed. While economists aren\u2019t too concerned about the current unemployment rate, subsequent increases as we get closer to the election could raise some concern. Interest rates remain elevated The June jobs report also indicated that wage growth is cooling, with average hourly earnings rising 0.3% for the month and slowing to a gain of 3.9% on an annual basis, its lowest rate in three years. Slowing wages could help set the stage for the\u00a0Federal Reserve\u00a0to begin cutting interest\u00a0rates\u00a0\u2014 if they also end up translating into slower\u00a0inflation. Strong wage growth can put upward pressure on prices, but\u00a0Fed\u00a0officials have said they focus primarily on\u00a0inflation\u00a0gauges to know if price hikes are under control or not. The Fed kicked off an aggressive rate-hike campaign in March 2022 in a bid to fend off a looming recession amid a post-pandemic inflation surge. But even though the coveted \u201csoft landing\u201d seems increasingly likely, in which a central bank brings inflation into line without triggering a recession or mass unemployment, the Fed has been hesitant to cut interest rates. Following a meeting in June, the central bank announced it was keeping its benchmark lending rate at its current level for the seventh time in a row, maintaining a 23-year high that has been the norm since last August. The historically high rates have put enormous strain on Americans\u2019 cost of living as they influence everything from mortgage rates to car loans. Although average rates for the standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage have fallen this year, they still remain well above 6%. Borrowing costs are poised to ease by the end of the year, but it may not be by much. Inflation is tentatively improving Along with interest rates, inflation has also been a top financial concern for Americans throughout Biden\u2019s term, as pandemic-era pressures on global supply chains and price gouging by retailers have pushed prices higher and higher since 2021. Inflation rates are nowhere near the pandemic-era peak reached in June 2022, when US inflation\u00a0hit 9.1%, its highest annual rate in more than 40 years. As of last month, annual inflation was 3%, down from 3.3% in May, according to the Consumer Price Index. Falling gas prices as well as a drop in new and used car prices helped to usher in the first month-on-month decline since May 2020, BLS data showed. On an annual basis, consumer prices are increasing at their slowest pace since June 2023, matching the lowest annual rate since early 2021. Despite the improvement, it may take time for these data points to have a palpable effect on consumer wallets, as life expenses remains overwhelmingly expensive for many who have been worn down by consistently high prices for the past three years. The Fed will also likely want to see a more consistent pattern of cooling inflation and clearer signs that inflation is trending towards the bank\u2019s 2% goal before it eases interest rates. Domestic manufacturing jobs A flagship of the Biden administration, the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act was passed in July 2022 to help companies bring chip manufacturing back to the United States and, as a result, help lower costs and prevent supply chain disruptions. Once a leader in semiconductor chip manufacturing, the United States has lost ground as countries like China ramped up production, forcing many American manufacturers to import chips \u2014 essential to the production of cars, smartphones and medical equipment. Since enacting the bill, the administration has poured billions into research and development and manufacturing in facilities across states including Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Oregon and Texas. \u201cCompanies have announced over $825 billion in investments in manufacturing and clean energy in the United States since the President took office, including in semiconductors,\u201d the White House announced in April. The new Democratic nominee could lean into the CHIPS and Science Act as a hallmark of the party\u2019s commitment to increasing domestic jobs. But the legislation comes as some manufacturing jobs have also been cut due to outsourcing. Manufacturing jobs across the country have plateaued at 13 million employees after recovering from a sharp pandemic-related downswing in 2020, according to\u00a0data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Specifically,\u00a0machinery manufacturing, which includes jobs that produce agriculture and construction equipment, has seen a decline of about 9,000 employees since the beginning of the year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/economy/democratic-nominee-2024-economy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

The plan was to make it into an entertainment conglomerate, combining the DVD rental business with its free streaming services, like Crackle, the entertainment platform once owned by Sony. Those plans didn\u2019t pan out, hindered by dual Hollywood strikes that limited production of fresh content and the decline of people renting physical DVDs that even forced rival Netflix to quit that part of its business last year. CSSE declined to comment. Deadline previously reported that Redbox hadn\u2019t paid employees for a week, and medical benefits have been suspended. Filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy could help the company fix those issues if its plans are approved by a court in Delaware. The company\u2019s publishing arm, which produces those ubiquitous self-help books that were once a worldwide phenomenon, isn\u2019t affected by the bankruptcy filing of its entertainment unit. The number of Redbox kiosks has grown to about 34,000 across the US, largely located at grocery and drug stores. Since its 2002 launch, Redbox has rented its 1 billion discs at prices cheaper than cable, according to its website.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/media/redbox-bankruptcy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

NBC announced on Wednesday it will use AI software to recreate Michaels\u2019 voice to deliver daily recaps of the Summer Games for subscribers of its Peacock streaming platform, a milestone for the use of AI by a major media company. The use of an AI voice for the Olympics comes as the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, sound and text. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries, such as journalism, about how artificial intelligence can \u2013 or even should \u2013 be used. A new tool, called \u201cYour Daily Olympic Recap on Peacock,\u201d will enable 10-minute highlights packages, which can include events updates, athlete back stories and other related content personalized by subscriber preferences. The company said the highlights could be packaged in about 7 million different ways, pulled from 5,000 hours of live coverage in Paris, effectively making AI (the artificial intelligence, not the man) a significantly more efficient way to deliver personalized recaps.  \u201cWhen I was approached about this, I was skeptical but obviously curious,\u201d Michaels said in a press release. \u201cThen I saw a demonstration detailing what they had in mind. I said, \u2018I\u2019m in.\u2019\u201d A NBC spokesperson told CNN Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. Michaels, a long-time broadcaster, is currently the play-by-play sportscaster for Thursday Night Football on Amazon Prime. He\u2019s also known for his work on previous Olympics Games broadcasts for both NBC and ABC and for calling the Miracle on Ice Game at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. NBC said the AI system was trained using prior NBC broadcast audio from Michaels. The company said a team of NBC Sports editors will review all of the content, including audio and clips, to make sure everything is factually accurate and names are pronounced correctly.

{"id": "2024_07_23_economy_real-estate-market-homebuyers", "text": "After the last few years of skyrocketing home prices and elevated mortgage rates, Americans have been feeling overwhelmingly dejected about their prospects of buying a home. But there are now signs that maybe, just maybe, the worst could be over for homebuyers. \u201cJune, in particular, has started to show the housing market slowing down in favor of buyers,\u201d said Skylar Olsen, Zillow\u2019s chief economist. During the pandemic, families and remote workers rushed to find homes offering extra space, taking advantage of historically low borrowing costs after the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to support the US economy. While the Fed doesn\u2019t directly set mortgage rates, its actions do influence borrowing costs throughout the economy. When the Fed began aggressively hiking rates again in March 2022 to battle historically high inflation, most economists expected housing demand to take a hit. High interest rates tend to decrease demand for homes, driving down prices. But something else happened. Demand for homes didn\u2019t disappear; instead, more homeowners held off on listing their homes to keep their pandemic-era ultra-low mortgage rates. This, coupled with an existing housing shortage, caused home prices to surge even higher. For the past two years, potential homebuyers have faced a double whammy of high prices and high mortgage rates. A recent report from real estate marketplace Zillow found that nearly one in four home sellers offered price cuts in June. That\u2019s the highest level for that month since 2018. Also, the average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell last week to its lowest level since mid-March. This, along with a jump in new home construction and the expectation the Federal Reserve could begin cutting interest rates in September, could make buying a home more affordable in the future. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a slow shift from a seller\u2019s market to a buyer\u2019s market,\u201d said National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun in a statement after the release of the trade group\u2019s latest existing home sales tally. \u201cHomes are sitting on the market a bit longer, and sellers are receiving fewer offers. More buyers are insisting on home inspections and appraisals, and inventory is definitively rising on a national basis.\u201d The report showed that sales of existing homes fell by 5.4% in June. Green shoots are starting to appear Things may soon start looking up for Americans interested in buying a new home, said Rick Sharga, founder of real estate consulting firm CJ Patrick Company. \u201cWe\u2019re sitting today at probably, if not the worst affordability ever, really close to the worst affordability ever \u2014 so we almost have nowhere to go but up,\u201d Sharga said. \u201cI do believe we\u2019re past the worst.\u201d In another promising indicator for homebuyers, home price appreciation is slowing, according to Zillow\u2019s June Market report. Annual appreciation was 3.2% in June and monthly growth decelerated to 0.6%, the slowest June price appreciation since 2011. While still below pre-pandemic levels, home inventory is piling up. According to the NAR\u2019s Tuesday report, there were 1.32 million active listings in June, a 23.4% jump compared to June of 2023. Potential homebuyers now may not feel as much pressure to make a snap decision. Homes in June sat on the market for an average of 15 days. While that is still shorter than pre-pandemic, it is four days longer than last year. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit more breathing room,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cThat\u2019s still a sign of a housing market that we classify as a sellers\u2019 market, but we\u2019re on the cusp of going neutral.\u201d A growing number of Wall Street investors \u2014 more than 90%, according to the CME FedWatch tool \u2014 are forecasting the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in September. That could translate to more relief from high monthly mortgage payments down the line. Lower mortgage rates could also, crucially, free up housing inventory, Sharga said. \u201cIt will likely entice some homeowners to list their properties and move on, which they haven\u2019t been doing with rates as high as they are,\u201d he said. Another major factor: Home construction is flourishing. Normally, higher borrowing costs make it more expensive to build, but according to US Census data, construction of new homes rose 3% in June, while the number of new, privately owned homes that completed construction jumped more than 10% in one month and 15.5% since June of last year. A potential downside However, buying a home still remains unaffordable for many Americans. The median price of a previously owned home rose to $426,900 in June, the second consecutive month that prices reached a fresh record high based on data going back to 1999, according to the NAR. It may take some time before homebuyers feel any improvement in their market, and since real estate is local, each area in the country tells a different story. For example, New Orleans is one city that has already tipped into becoming a buyers\u2019 market, according to Zillow data. While that may sound like great news for people looking to buy homes in the area, Leslie Heindel, a Realtor in New Orleans, said lower home prices in the city mask other costs. \u201cWhen the pandemic started, everything went crazy. Something would hit the market and you would have 20 offers in one day,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then insurance changed here and that was it for us.\u201d Heindel said that homeowners\u2019 insurance rates have shot up for many people in the area, creating an additional, and often unexpected, cost of owning a home. \u201cFor people to be able to buy a house, we couldn\u2019t continue selling at inflated prices along with higher interest rates and the insurance situation,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can definitely get something cheaper here now, but there\u2019s a reason for it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/economy/real-estate-market-homebuyers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_business_delta-canceled-flights-computer-problems", "text": "Three days after a computer update problem caused more than 5,000 flight cancellations around the world in a single day, things are pretty much back to normal \u2014 except at Delta Air Lines. Atlanta-based Delta canceled more than 1,000 more flights Monday alone, according to flight tracking service FlightAware, when counting both Delta\u2019s mainline operations and Endeavor, its regional airline that feeds its system under the Delta Connection brand. Those 1,000 flights represented just over half of all flights canceled by airlines worldwide on Monday, and about three-quarters of the flights within, to or from the United States, as most carriers returned to normal operations. Other US airlines had 2% or fewer of their flights canceled. Monday\u2019s problems follow 1,500 flights that Delta canceled on Friday and nearly 3,000 more flights over the weekend. The problems likely left tens of thousands of frustrated Delta customers stranded and unable to return home, many of them being booked onto a series of flights that would subsequently be canceled as well. Lack of available hotel rooms left many forced to sleep in airports and wait for hours on hold trying to get through to Delta in an often-futile effort to find a flight. In a note to customers Sunday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian apologized for the disruptions and attributed the problem to the computer program affecting its \u201ccrew tracking\u201d software. \u201cOne of our crew tracking-related tools was affected and unable to\u00a0effectively process the unprecedented number of changes triggered by the system shutdown,\u201d he wrote in a note to customers.\u00a0\u201cOur teams have been working around the clock to recover and restore full functionality.\u201d While many airlines large and small had the CrowdStrike problem affect computers that were supposed to check in passengers, it appeared that Delta might have been the one airline that had its crucial crew scheduling software affected. At Atlanta\u2019s Hartsfield International Airport on Monday, friends Nicole\u00a0DaSilva, Tiffany Denlinger and Melissa Levine had been traveling since Saturday to get home to Tucson, Arizona, after an international trip to Athens. But they were told that finding a flight for the last leg of their trip could take until Wednesday or Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on multiple different flights, and they\u2019ve all been canceled,\u201d DaSilva said, clutching a handful of tickets that could not be used. Denlinger stayed glued to her phone, waiting to speak with a Delta employee. She held up her phone to show how long she\u2019s been on hold: \u201cSix hours and 20 minutes,\u201d she said. But the problem with the critical crew tracking system was still not fixed as of Monday morning, according to a video message to Delta staff from Bastian and Rahul Samant, the company\u2019s chief information officer. \u201cSo we\u2019re optimistic we\u2019ll get it done,\u201d Samant said in the video message. \u201cThere will be some things as Ed said, that we will do today, tomorrow to get to a better place by the end of the week.\u201d He said the IT staff is working \u201cfeverishly\u201d and \u201caround the clock\u201d to fix the problem. Delta appears to still be in the dark about the whereabouts of their crew members. Crew members logging on to the company\u2019s computer system to sign up for flights receive prompts and questions that include: \u201cPlease enter below what airport code you are closest to,\u201d \u201cWhat is your current status?\u201d and \u201cPlease describe your current location.\u201d A person familiar with the airline\u2019s operations allowed CNN to see screen shots of the prompts. Delta would not comment on the screen shots. Delta is offering crew members premium pay, as well as additional assurances they will be able to travel back to their homes at the end of their work period, according to the screen shots viewed by CNN. The premium pay and assurances would be in place through Friday, another sign the staffing problem may not be fixed for several more days. Delta also declined to comment on these offers to crew members. The problems with the flight groundings and delays produced nightmares for travelers throughout the weekend. And they were only one part of the \u201clargest IT outage in history\u201d that was caused by the CrowdStrike, which shut down an estimated 8.5 million computers running Windows software worldwide, disrupting hospital operations, package deliveries, banking and retail transactions. CrowdStrike said late Sunday that \u201ca significant number\u201d of those affected computers \u201care back online and operational.\u201d But in the case of affected airlines, it is not just computers that need to be fixed. It can take longer to get crews needed to fly planes in the right cities to again staff flights. \u201cAn airline is kind of like your circulatory system. If it stops, even for just a short time, the blood isn\u2019t where it\u2019s supposed to be,\u201d said airline consultant Michael Boyd. \u201cGetting airplanes back to where they need to be, people where they need to be\u2026all of that takes time. So even if it\u2019s disrupted for only a few hours, it can take five times as long to make it right.\u201d The problem for passengers was made worse by the busy summer travel season, according to Bastian\u2019s message to Delta customers. \u201cThe technology issue occurred on the busiest travel weekend of the summer, with our booked loads exceeding 90%, limiting our reaccommodation capabilities,\u201d he wrote. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg spoke with Bastian on Sunday about the problems and taking steps to compensate passengers, according to a statement from the Department of Transportation. \u201cI have made clear to Delta that we expect the airline to provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to be rebooked, and free rebooking and timely reimbursements for food and overnight hotel stays to consumers affected by the delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance to all of their passengers,\u201d said Buttigieg in the DOT statement. \u201cNo one should be stranded at an airport overnight or stuck on hold for hours waiting to talk to a customer service agent.\u201d Bastian told Delta passengers in the message that the airline would \u201ccontinue to offer meal vouchers, hotel accommodations and transportation where available. And as a gesture of apology, we\u2019re also providing impacted customers with Delta SkyMiles and travel vouchers.\u201d The problems at Delta are similar to the problems that occurred at Southwest Airlines over the end-of-year holiday travel period in 2022 when it had to cancel nearly 17,000 flights over the course of more than a week. In that instance the problem was attributed to its crew scheduling system, which Southwest unions criticized as \u201cantiquated\u201d and which Southwest executives vowed to fix in the wake of the service meltdown.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/business/delta-canceled-flights-computer-problems/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_tech_meta-eu-competition-rules", "text": "Facebook parent Meta has been accused of breaking Europe\u2019s new digital competition rules over its \u201cpay or consent\u201d advertising model. Late last year, Meta (META)\u00a0launched\u00a0a service called \u201cSubscription for no ads,\u201d allowing European users of Facebook and Instagram to pay up to \u20ac12.99 ($14) a month for ad-free versions. The alternative is to accept versions with personalized ads. The European Commission said in a statement Monday that, in its preliminary view, \u201cthis binary choice forces users to consent to the (use) of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalized but equivalent version of Meta\u2019s social networks.\u201d If the provisional findings of the Commission\u2019s investigation are confirmed, the EU could hit Meta with a fine equivalent to 10% of its global annual revenue under its landmark Digital Markets Act. Based on the company\u2019s 2023 results, that would amount to $13.5 billion. Meta said it didn\u2019t accept the Commission\u2019s findings. \u201c\u2019Subscription for no ads\u2019 follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.\u201d The EU announcement comes a week after the Commission accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the DMA by preventing app developers from freely directing consumers to cheaper services. The regulators are also investigating Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) under the new law. The DMA, which came into force in March, requires dominant online platforms \u2014 so-called gatekeepers \u2014 to give users more choice, and rivals more opportunities to compete. Online platforms often collect personal data across their own and third-party services and use it in digital advertising services. Margrethe Vestager, a European Commissioner in charge of competition policy, noted in Monday\u2019s statement that Meta had been accumulating personal data of \u201cmillions of EU citizens over many years.\u201d \u201cWe want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalized ads experience,\u201d she said. Michael Koenig, a senior official at the Commission, said Meta must offer users an alternative to \u201cfull\u201d ad personalization that \u201cdoes not rely on this personal data and which is then automatically less personalized and still available to them.\u201d \u201cThen Meta is free to keep a third option, which is a subscription not to see ads at all, or a fourth option which may have some premium features,\u201d he told journalists.

{"id": "2024_07_01_media_hunter-biden-sues-fox-news", "text": "Hunter Biden has sued Fox News and its parent corporation, accusing the right-wing network of smearing him and unlawfully publishing his explicit images without his consent in a 2022 miniseries about his legal troubles. In the lawsuit, filed Sunday in New York state court, the president\u2019s sonaccuses Fox News of unjust enrichment, intentionally inflicting emotional distress, and violating New York civil rights laws. The lawsuit makes good on\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s threat he made in April that he would take the network to court if it didn\u2019t immediately issue retractions and corrections. The miniseries, \u201cThe Trial of Hunter Biden,\u201d was a six-part offering on the Fox Nation digital streaming network, and was also promoted on Fox News, the cable TV channel. It featured a dramatized \u201cmock trial\u201d about Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas financial dealings that led in part to his federal tax indictment and that also fueled House Republicans\u2019 struggling impeachment inquiry into his father. Fox News\u00a0took down the miniseries\u00a0in late April, one day after Hunter Biden threatened to file a lawsuit. But according to the lawsuit, promotional materials for the miniseries are still on some Fox News-linked social media pages, and the miniseries episodes are still circulating \u201conline and in the public domain.\u201d A Fox News spokesperson claimed the lawsuit was meritless and \u201centirely politically motivated,\u201d and said the network looks forward to \u201cvindicating our rights in court.\u201d \u201cThe core complaint stems from a 2022 streaming program that Mr. Biden did not complain about until sending a letter in late April 2024,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe program was removed within days of the letter, in an abundance of caution, but Hunter Biden is a public figure who has been the subject of multiple investigations and is now a convicted felon. Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden\u2019s own making.\u201d The new lawsuit claims Fox News \u201ctargeted Mr. (Hunter) Biden in an effort to harass, annoy, alarm, and humiliate him, and tarnish his reputation.\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s son is seeking an unspecified amount of punitive damages, as well as any profits that Fox reaped from the miniseries, and other corrective measures. \u201cThe miniseries is fictionalized; it is not a news event. It was made for the purpose of trade and advertising, and merely exploits Mr. Biden\u2019s name, image, and likeness for Fox\u2019s commercial benefit,\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers wrote in the lawsuit. Hunter Biden\u2019s team said in the lawsuit that without his consent, Fox News \u201cunlawfully published numerous intimate images (both still and video) of Mr. Biden depicting him in the nude, depicting an unclothed or exposed intimate part of him, as well as engaged in sex acts.\u201d The right-wing network said these images originated form Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0infamous laptop\u00a0\u2013 data from which was leaked by allies for former President Donald Trump in 2020. The president\u2019s son was\u00a0convicted at a trial\u00a0last month on federal gun charges, and faces a second trial this fall on alleged tax crimes. However, he hasn\u2019t been charged in connection with the bribery and foreign lobbying allegations that were at the center of Fox\u2019s \u201cmock trial\u201d series.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/media/hunter-biden-sues-fox-news/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_04_23_cars_electric-vehicle-sales-forecast-iea", "text": "Global electric vehicle sales are set to rise by more than a fifth to reach 17 million this year, powered by drivers in China, according to the International Energy Agency. In a report Tuesday, the IEA projected that \u201csurging demand\u201d for EVs over the next decade was set \u201cto remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport.\u201d It expects half of all cars sold globally to be electric by 2035, up from more than one in five this year, provided charging infrastructure keeps pace. The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs. The agency\u2019s bullish long-term outlook for EVs \u2014 based on current government policies \u2014 comes just days after the world\u2019s biggest battery EV maker Tesla slashed its prices in major markets to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers. Recent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The data \u201cdoes not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars. It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday. The growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers. The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union rose almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. In a statement, Birol said: \u201cRather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.\u201d Despite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats. In the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the world\u2019s biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States. Earlier this month, Tesla posted its first annual drop in sales in nearly four years. The company\u2019s stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year. China\u2019s BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023. Automakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the \u201cpace of the transition to EVs\u2026 will hinge on affordability.\u201d In China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average. \u201cIntensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,\u201d the IEA said. \u201cGrowing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,\u201d it added. Last year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market. \u201cChina is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,\u201d Birol said. Concerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an investigation late last year into China\u2019s state support for EV makers. The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the region\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW. EV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country. By 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA. That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year. \u201cThis shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,\u201d Birol said. The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector. In addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States. Under current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA.

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can \u201clisten\u201d to people\u2019s questions and converse in real time. \u201cShellie\u201d can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while \u201cArif\u201d is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_business_tennessee-lottery-store-clerk-ticket-theft", "text": "A Tennessee man only learned he was the winner of a $1 million jackpot when detectives called to tell him his winning ticket had been stolen, according to authorities. The lottery winner, who did not want to be publicly identified, bought two winning tickets at a Shell gas station in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, the\u00a0Rutherford County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a news release on Monday. One winning ticket had a prize of $40 and the other was the $1 million ticket. A clerk at the gas station stole the ticket and tried to collect the prize, authorities said. Store video obtained by investigators of the Tennessee Lottery shows Meet Patel scanning the tickets, according to authorities. To save time, the customer had only scratched off the front bar code, and then asked Patel to check if the tickets were winners, authorities told CNN affiliate WTVF. \u201cIf you scratch off the front bar code, it will tell you if it\u2019s a winner or not, regardless of whether you scratch off everything showing how much you won,\u201d Lt. Det. Steve Craig told WTVF. Patel then placed the $1 million ticket in the trash, authorities said. Later, the video allegedly shows him taking out the trash, after which he removes the winning ticket and puts it in his pocket. \u201cMr. Patel is then seen later in the video celebrating in the store after scratching off the front of the ticket and learning it was a $1 million winner,\u201d Det. Dennis Ward said in the news release. For any prize of $200,000 or more, players must claim their winnings at the Tennessee Lottery\u2019s Nashville headquarters. Patel, 23, tried to claim his prize from the Tennessee Lottery, but employees there were suspicious, according to the news release. \u201cHe went to the Tennessee Lottery Commission to claim the ticket as his own and through their normal line of questioning there were enough red flags for them to say, \u2018Hey, you need to get all of your affairs in order and come back to us and we\u2019re gonna hold on to the ticket,\u2019\u201d Craig told WTVF. Patel\u00a0is currently being held on a charge of theft over $250,000 at the Rutherford County Adult Detention Center, the sheriff\u2019s office told CNN. His bond is set at $100,000 and a hearing is scheduled for July 30. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious. It\u2019s good enough for me to put in front of 12 jurors and make sure that they all come to the same conclusion,\u201d Craig said. The sheriff\u2019s office reviewed the video to help identify the man who bought the ticket. Less than a day later, Ward told the man, who is a father, he was a winner and convinced him to claim his winnings. \u201cThe feel-good side of this story is the (father) never knew he was the winner until we made contact with him,\u201d Craig said. \u201cThat is absolutely life-changing money.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/business/tennessee-lottery-store-clerk-ticket-theft/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_business_crowdstrike-tech-nightcap", "text": "In case recent events \u2014\u00a0an assassination attempt, a new Republican vice presidential nominee, the sitting president contracting Covid before dropping his reelection bid \u2014 didn\u2019t leave you feeling sufficiently anxious about the fragility of the global order, let\u2019s not forget that a cybersecurity company you\u2019ve probably never heard of made a major oopsie that showed how the internet could, without warning, just kind of stop. While you might not have known the name CrowdStrike before, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll forget it soon. With a single bug in a routine software update, the company triggered what was likely the biggest computer outage in history \u2014 creating the kind of tech meltdown that its products are designed to prevent. While CrowdStrike said the flawed update had been rolled back,\u00a0the problems it caused aren\u2019t exactly the old \u201cturn it off and turn it back on\u201d solutions most of us are accustomed to. As my colleague Brian Fung reported, the bug that put Windows computers into Blue Screen of Death mode is fixable. But in many cases, it requires painstaking work by a human being. Now might be a good moment to buy your IT staff some good coffee and a bagel spread because each and every affected device \u2014 for some organizations, we\u2019re talking thousands \u2014 will likely have to be assessed by an admin and rebooted into safe mode, and then the offending file can be deleted by hand. \u201cYou can\u2019t automate that,\u201d said Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher and former Microsoft threat analyst, in\u00a0a post on X. \u201cSo this is going to be incredibly painful for CrowdStrike customers.\u201d And even if your business had nothing to do with CrowdStrike, the outage still might have ruined your day. Think of a cafe that uses third-party online reservation services, contracts out its delivery orders and accepts credit and debit cards through its point of sale, which is connected to payment processor back-end systems. You didn\u2019t have to be a CrowdStrike customer to get screwed by the company\u2019s mistake, and that\u2019s what made Friday\u2019s outage so frustrating. We\u2019ve had scary outages before, and we will certainly have them again. But the scale of the CrowdStrike outage is once again underscoring just how interconnected the world has become through a network almost none of us understands and which is largely self-regulating. \u201cThere are organizations that we\u2019re heavily dependent upon that we don\u2019t even realize how dependent we are until they stop functioning,\u201d said Stuart Madnick, a professor of information technology at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Microsoft estimated the CrowdStrike outage affected some 8.5 million Windows devices. Airlines canceled 5,000 flights around the world Friday, while delays persisted through the weekend and into Monday. Hospitals and government services were throttled, and in some areas 911 communications stopped working. It\u2019d be easy to put all the blame on CrowdStrike for its sloppy system update, or the airlines for not building robust backup protocols, or even Microsoft for dominating the personal computing market. But IT experts told me there are broader systemic problems at play here. The centralized nature of cybersecurity companies means that we now have \u201ca few big failure points,\u201d said Anil Khurana,\u00a0executive director of the Baratta Center for Global Business at Georgetown\u2019s McDonough\u00a0Business School. \u201cThat by itself is not bad, because proliferation actually makes diagnostics even more difficult.\u201d But companies need \u201ca better model of operational redundancy and back-ups,\u201d Khurana said. \u201cOur tech platforms have a mix of legacy systems coupled with modern systems, which means that the weakest link determines the overall system performance. I call it a \u2018house of cards\u2019 model.\u201d Right now, there are safeguards in place, but regulators around the world have been snoozing on cybersecurity risk management. IT systems are truly critical infrastructure, Khurana said, which suggests they \u201cought to go through the same kind of rigor, testing and oversight that we see for the likes of Boeing or JPMorgan.\u201d I asked Madnick whether the world should expect more mass outages. \u201cThis was pretty bad as it is,\u201d he said. \u201cCould it get worse? The answer is yes, it could.\u201d As onerous and time-consuming as the manual reboot of millions of devices is, Friday\u2019s outage was ultimately a one-off mistake by a company that moved quickly to fix it. A bad actor looking to do serious damage could use software to \u201cmake computers or other equipment blow up, catch fire, burn \u2014 in which case, you don\u2019t just reboot it, it\u2019s destroyed.\u201d OK, so there\u2019s one nightmare scenario to make us all yearn to go live in a cave. But before you start stockpiling canned goods, Madnick has another way to look at our modern predicament. \u201cThere are a lot of benefits that these technologies give us that really pay off, 99% of the time,\u201d he said. The most important thing is to prepare for that\u00a01% of times when things go wrong.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/23/business/crowdstrike-tech-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

Wiz\u00a0CEO Assaf Rappaport said the company would now focus on an initial public offering and growing the business to generate $1 billion in annual revenue. \u201cI know the last week has been intense, with the buzz about a potential acquisition. While we are flattered by offers we have received, we have chosen to continue on our path to building Wiz,\u201d Rappaport said in the memo. \u201cSaying no to such humbling offers is tough, but with our exceptional team, I feel confident in making that choice.\u201d Neither Alphabet (GOOGL) nor\u00a0Wiz\u00a0had officially acknowledged talks about a deal, and the Wiz\u00a0memo did not mention Google or its parent by name. A person familiar with the matter told CNN on Tuesday that Wiz management, after seriously considering the Google offer, decided to walk away because they want to remain an independent company and are confident Wiz can be built into one of the biggest cybersecurity firms on the planet. Risks around a potentially lengthy and challenging antitrust review were in the background but were not a deciding factor here, the source told CNN. CNN\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier this month that Alphabet was in advanced talks to buy\u00a0Wiz\u00a0for roughly $23 billion, citing a person familiar with the matter. Discussions between Google and Wiz began after the\u00a0startup raised $1 billion\u00a0from venture capital investors earlier this year, the source said. That funding round had valued Wiz at $12 billion. Wiz\u00a0provides cloud-based cybersecurity solutions that help companies identify and remove critical risks on cloud platforms. Wiz\u2019s decision to call off the deal will be a setback for Google, which has been investing in its cloud infrastructure and focusing on winning clients for the cloud business that generated more than $33 billion in revenue last year. It is the second recent blow for Alphabet in its M&A efforts, after it reportedly decided\u00a0to walk away\u00a0from a deal for online marketing software company HubSpot.

The case is the latest\u00a0legal twist\u00a0for\u00a0Kakao, which runs South Korea\u2019s largest chat app, after the company and another executive went on trial last year for alleged wrongdoing during the same acquisition. Kim, who is also known as Brian Kim, is seen as a visionary in South Korea\u2019s digital industry for building\u00a0Kakao\u2019s group of affiliates \u2013 worth 86 trillion won ($62 billion) by assets \u2013 from the ground up since launching the chat app in 2010. Any case against him could jeopardize\u00a0Kakao\u2019s investments into artificial intelligence as well as its overseas expansion plans, industry experts said. Prosecutors say Kim was involved in manipulating the stock price of SM Entertainment\u00a0in February last year to hinder a competitor, Hybe, from acquiring it. Kim has denied the accusations, saying he never ordered or tolerated any illegal activity, the company said in a statement. He has so far not been formally charged.\u00a0Kakao\u00a0and Kim\u2019s lawyer did not immediately provide further comment on Tuesday. The high-profile tech entrepreneur is the largest shareholder of\u00a0Kakao\u00a0Corp, with a 24% stake that he and affiliated entities control. Seoul Southern District Court approved the arrest warrant to prevent the potential destruction of evidence, and because Kim was a flight risk, a court official said on Tuesday. Kim is being held at the Seoul Nambu Detention Centre, a prosecution spokesperson said. His arrest will last up to 20 days, during which the prosecutors will investigate further before deciding whether to indict him, according to South Korean criminal procedure. The outcome of any case against Kim could jeopardize\u00a0Kakao\u00a0group\u2019s control of online bank arm\u00a0KakaoBank Corp, since the country\u2019s financial rules restrict those convicted of financial crime from owning a more than a 10% stake in a bank.

{"id": "2024_07_22_tech_hackers-crowdstrike-outage-scams", "text": "Cybercriminals are already capitalizing on the chaos from Friday\u2019s massive global tech outage by promoting fake websites filled with malicious software designed to compromise unsuspecting victims, according to warnings from the US government and multiple cybersecurity professionals. Hackers have been setting up phony websites meant to appeal to people seeking information on, or solutions to, the worldwide IT meltdown but in reality are designed to harvest visitors\u2019 information or to breach their devices, the security experts said. The fraudulent sites use domain names that include keywords such as CrowdStrike \u2014 the cybersecurity firm behind a faulty software update that led to the crisis \u2014 or \u201cblue screen,\u201d which is what computers affected by the CrowdStrike glitch display when they boot up. The fraudulent sites may try to lure victims in by promising a quick fix to the CrowdStrike issue or scam them with offers of fake cryptocurrency. In a bulletin about the outage, the Department of Homeland Security said it has witnessed \u201cthreat actors taking advantage of this incident for phishing and other malicious activity.\u201d \u201cRemain vigilant and only follow instructions from legitimate sources,\u201d said the bulletin issued by the Department\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. CrowdStrike has issued its own guidance on what affected organizations can do in response to the issue. The situation illustrates how a volatile, high-impact news event has created secondary risks for millions of people as malign actors try to benefit from the CrowdStrike disaster and as thousands of organizations scramble to recover from CrowdStrike\u2019s faulty software update. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty standard pattern we see following incidents on this scale,\u201d said Kenn White, an independent security researcher specializing in network security, in an interview with CNN. \u201cCriminals are tireless in their creative pursuits to exploit the most vulnerable.\u201d Amid Friday\u2019s outage, CrowdStrike itself warned of hackers trying to exploit the situation by \u201cleveraging the event as a lure.\u201d In a blog post, CrowdStrike said malicious actors are not only creating fake websites but also impersonating CrowdStrike employees in scam emails and phone calls, even selling bogus software purporting to fix the glitch. One example of that has been targeting Spanish-speaking CrowdStrike customers, the company said in a separate blog post. The attack comes in the form of a misleadingly named file called crowdstrike-hotfix.zip. When opened, the file installs malicious software that phones home to a server the hackers control and may use to give additional instructions to the malware. There is currently no automated fix for recovering from the CrowdStrike software glitch, which security experts have said will mean a long and arduous recovery that\u2019s likely to cost millions \u2014\u00a0if not billions \u2014\u00a0of dollars. \u201cCrowdStrike Intelligence recommends that organizations ensure they are communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels and they adhere to technical guidance the CrowdStrike support teams have provided,\u201d the company said. In some ways, what is currently playing out in cyberspace resembles how mis- and disinformation can overwhelm the public\u2019s understanding of events taking place in the physical world. Hackers commonly try to use high-profile news stories to funnel traffic their way. For example, after the massive Equifax data breach announced in 2017, security companies said they observed cybercriminals sending hundreds of thousands of phishing emails impersonating banks. The emails sought to prey on anxious victims who, given the Equifax news, may have been more likely to open an email from their financial institution, experts said at the time. These types of event-driven scams are taking place against the backdrop of a broader rise in impersonation scams. In recent years, the Federal Trade Commission has pointed to an uptick of scams in which cybercriminals pretend to be government officials or agencies, such as the Internal Revenue Service or the Social Security Administration. During the Covid-19 emergency, creative hackers even posed as FTC Chair Lina Khan and sent fake emails that falsely claimed the agency was distributing pandemic relief funds \u2014 prompting the FTC to plead with consumers not to respond to those messages. Americans have collectively lost hundreds of millions of dollars to these impersonation scams, the FTC has said. In a situation like the CrowdStrike outage, where people are searching for information in an urgent, fast-moving crisis and are hungry for solutions, phishing can mislead well-intentioned people and organizations into taking the wrong steps, making a bad deal even worse. Phishing dangers compound other knock-on risks, as well. Some organizations may decide on their own to weaken or even disable their cybersecurity defenses while trying to get operations back to normal. \u201cAs customers start to recover, they\u2019ll most likely disable or modify their CrowdStrike protections,\u201d said Azim Khodjibaev, a cybersecurity researcher at Cisco Talos, the cybersecurity arm of the networking company Cisco, in a post on X. \u201cThis is going to leave a whole [lot] of people exposed!\u201d If businesses start falling victim to phishing attacks that wind up compromising important data or key systems, it could have ripple effects for their corporate clients and consumers, warned Brett Callow, managing director of the cybersecurity practice at FTI Consulting. \u201cBad actors routinely try to take advantage of current events, so it\u2019s not all surprising to see them attempting to take advantage of this one,\u201d Callow said. \u201cAnd this, of course, is something that customers of companies which have experienced high profile incidents need to be ready for.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/tech/hackers-crowdstrike-outage-scams/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_23_business_tesla-earnings", "text": "Telsa profit in the second quarter plunged more than 40% from a year ago, as the electric vehicle company has faced both more EV competition from established automakers and a slowing of overall EV sales growth. The drop in profits is a stark contrast for a company that grew to become the world\u2019s most valuable automaker on surging sales and profitability. The results underscore how Tesla, a pioneer in bringing electric vehicles to American drivers, now faces more intense competition from rivals at home and abroad. And with the EV market maturing, the growth in consumer interest for EVs has slowed. Tesla reported adjusted income of $1.8 billiion in the quarter, or 52 cents a share. Analysts had forecast earnings of 61 cents a share, compared to the 91 cents a share it earned a year earlier. Its key measure of profit margin was sharply lower, as a series of price cuts on EVs took a toll. The April through June period was the second straight quarter of year-over-year sales declines for the company, its first-ever consecutive quarters of declining sales volume. The only previous quarter with a sales decline since Tesla went public came early in the pandemic, when stay-at-home orders forced its factories to close. Tesla did not give a new sales target for the full year. But it did warn that \u201cIn 2024, our vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023.\u201d Tesla CEO Elon Musk disparaged the quality of EVs from other automakers now in the market on the investors call after the release, saying they posed only a short-term issue for Tesla, not a long-term issue. He said Tesla remains convinced the world is moving toward fully electric transportation systems, not just for cars, but for planes and ships as well. Musk also said that the company would release more details on fully-automated robotaxis in October, rather than a previously planned August. The company calls its driver assist feature \u201cFull Self Driving,\u201d but that still requires drivers to be ready to take control of the car. Tesla still faces regulatory and technical hurdles before it can offer robotoxis without drivers, the company said in its earning statement. Musk said he still believes that is possible to achieve by the end of this year, and definitely by next year, but he cautioned: \u201cMy predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past.\u201d Tesla faces federal investigations into some of Musk\u2019s claims about Full Self Driving capabilities. The company has also faced a Department of Justice inquiry in the past, although it\u2019s unclear what the current status is of that investigation. He did announce Tesla\u2019s plans to build an assembly plant in Mexico have been put on hold. The plans were announced more than a year ago, but Musk said the plans have now been paused until after the presidential election because of a threat by Republican nominee Donald Trump to slap tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico. Musk is a strong Trump supporter, both endorsing him and reportedly pledging tens of millions of dollars toward the former president\u2019s re-election efforts. Trump vowed similar tariffs on Mexican-built cars in 2019, when he was president, but never followed through. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) fell more than 8% in after-hours trading. Shares are down about 1% so far this year through Tuesday\u2019s close, after being down as much as 44% earlier this year.

{"id": "2024_07_17_markets_us-markets-selloff", "text": "Tech shares slumped Wednesday as investors shed the behemoths that fueled Wall Street\u2019s monster stock rally this year. The Nasdaq Composite index tumbled 2.8%, logging its worst day since December 2022. The S&P 500 lost 1.4%. The Dow rose 0.6%, closing at another record high and above 41,000 for the first time. That comes exactly two months after the Dow first closed above the 40,000 level. Shares of tech heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) slumped 6.6% and rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares dropped by 10.2%. The selloff comes after a Tuesday report from Bloomberg that the Biden administration is mulling plans to impose more sanctions on Chinese tech firms and to heighten semiconductor trade restrictions between the US and China. The US Commerce Department declined to comment. Investors are also selling tech stocks after a cool inflation report last week and stronger-than-expected retail sales data on Tuesday pushed up bets for a rate cut in September. Wall Street is looking to beaten-down stocks that tend to perform better when borrowing costs are low. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks the performance of small-cap stocks, fell in midday trading Wednesday but is still up 4.5% for the week. The Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which have led most of the gains this year thanks to the artificial intelligence boom, tumbled. Microsoft (MSFT) shares fell 1.3%, Apple (AAPL) shares slid 2.5%, Amazon (AMZN) shares declined 2.6%, Alphabet shares declined 1.6%, Tesla shares slipped 3.1% and Meta Platforms shares lost 5.7%.
