{"id": "2024_06_28_business_walgreens-cvs-closing", "text": "Walgreens said Thursday that it plans to close a \u201csignificant\u201d number of its roughly 8,600 stores in the United States. Around 25% of Walgreens\u2019 stores aren\u2019t profitable, and the chain will look to close stores that are right by one another or struggling to hold down theft, CEO Tim Wentworth said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. Walgreens and other retailers have been hit by shoplifting and resorted to locking up items or closing high-theft stores since the pandemic, but Walgreens\u2019 problems are much deeper, including competition and failed growth strategies. Walgreens admitted last year it \u201ccried too much\u201d over the business impact of shoplifting. The latest closures are part of a larger downturn, not just for Walgreens, but for other drug store chains, too, after years of expansion. Walgreens said in 2019 it would close 200 stores and last year announced an additional 150 store closures. \u201cWe are at a point where the current pharmacy model is not sustainable,\u201d Wentworth said. CVS, the largest US chain, closed 244 stores between 2018 and 2020. In 2021, it announced plans to close 900 stores. And Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy last year and will close up to 500 stores. Shifting trends Drug store chains are struggling because of falling reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, according to analysts who cover the industry. The majority of drugstores\u2019 sales comes from filling prescriptions. But their profits from that business have dropped in recent years because of lower reimbursement rates for prescription drugs and higher fees. The prices customers pay for drugs and the payments pharmacies receive are largely determined by\u00a0pharmacy benefit managers, known as\u00a0PBMs, which negotiate rebates from drug manufacturers to insurers. PBMs have been cutting reimbursement rates to boost their own profits, said Elizabeth Anderson, an analyst at Evercore IRI. The pharmacy industry has complained that PBMs have too much control over the industry and can squeeze pharmacies. PBMs argue that they help keep drug prices down by negotiating with drug makers. \u201cIf reimbursement rates start to come down and drug stores can\u2019t offset it with other growth, then it has a negative impact on their profitability,\u201d she said. At the same time, the rest of the store that\u2019s supposed to pad the profit margins aren\u2019t doing it so much anymore. The front end of drug stores, where they sell snacks and household staples, have become less profitable, as shoppers buy more of these items online from Amazon and at big-box chains such as Walmart and Costco. Both have grown in recent years. Dollar General\u2019s growth has also hurt drug store chains in rural areas. \u201cThe front end is suffering like other retailers,\u201d Anderson said. Walgreens, CVS and other drug stores have moved into primary care to try to lure in shoppers, adding doctors\u2019 offices to hundreds of stores. Walgreens took a $5.2 billion stake in VillageMD, a primary care network, in 2021. But VIllageMD has not been profitable for Walgreens, and Walgreens has tried to cut costs. It has been closing VillageMD locations and said Thursday it will divest from the company. Helping the company, hurting the consumer Walgreens\u2019 coming closures might help the company\u2019s bottom line, but are likely to hurt access to health care. When pharmacies close, some patients have to travel farther to get the medications they need. Researchers find pharmacy closures lead to health risks such as\u00a0older adults failing to take medication. The loss of a retail pharmacy can leave a void, especially for lower-income households. Roughly one out of every eight pharmacies closed between 2009 and 2015, which disproportionately affected independent pharmacies and low-income neighborhoods, according to a\u00a0study\u00a0published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study found that pharmacies at greatest risk for closures are those with a large customer base on public insurance, which have lower reimbursement rates than private plans, as well as independent pharmacies.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/business/walgreens-cvs-closing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_business_economy-election-presidential-debate", "text": "Bill Clinton\u2019s campaign was right on the money when it coined the famous \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d phrase in 1992. That\u2019s because the economy has consistently ranked among the top \u2014 if not the very top \u2014 voter issues in presidential election after presidential election. The current contest is far from an exception, with close to 90% of respondents in a May ABC News/Ipsos poll indicating that the economy is the most important issue in determining who gets their vote in November. That means it\u2019s all but guaranteed to be a major talking point during Thursday night\u2019s debate, which kicks off at 9 pm ET on CNN. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have polar opposite views on the economy \u2014 and both undoubtedly will try to sell you on their visions, policies and records. To make heads or tails of what they say (or if you\u2019re trying to impress anyone you might be watching the debate with), it\u2019s good to make sure you understand the economy we\u2019re in right now. Disclaimer: The topics below are in no way an exhaustive list of everything going on in the US economy, plus, everyone experiences it differently. Unemployment: Low, but with warning signs ahead The nation\u2019s unemployment rate stayed below 4% for 27 months, its longest such streak and a match for a period in the 1960s. That streak ended last month, when the unemployment rate rose to 4% from 3.9%. At the same time, the number of job openings in the US recently fell to a new three-year low, another sign of cooling in the labor market. That means job seekers might find it harder to get hired. In particular, the job market for recent college graduates has weakened. The unemployment rate for bachelor\u2019s degree recipients aged 20 to 29 is above 12%, an almost four-percentage-point increase from a year ago, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Inflation: Elevated, but cooling Inflation slowed more than expected last month, falling to 3.3% from 3.4% in April. By comparison, at this time last year it was 4%, and two years ago it was 9%. But there\u2019s a reason why you\u2019re probably feeling like everything is still really expensive. While discounts are starting to appear more at big-box retailers like Target and Walmart and fast-food giants like McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s, price cuts aren\u2019t occurring across the board. That\u2019s because when inflation cools off, it simply means that the pace of price increases is slowing. However, it does not mean that the actual prices we pay for goods and services are lower than they were a year ago. Housing: Still unaffordable Home prices are at a record high and have been climbing for 11 straight months as housing shortages persist. That\u2019s partly because many homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgages during the pandemic don\u2019t want to move and risk having to pay a much higher mortgage rate. Average 30-year fixed-rate mortgages recently hit the highest level of the year. While they\u2019ve started to fall, mortgage rates are still higher than anything seen in the decade before 2022. Mortgage rates are so high in part because inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. As a result, the central bank has held off cutting interest rates, which would otherwise make it cheaper to get a mortgage. In turn, many would-be homebuyers are renting for longer than they otherwise may have, which is driving rents higher, too.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/business/economy-election-presidential-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_28_business_boeing-ntsb-violation-absurdity", "text": "If you\u2019re a PR person, I can\u2019t possibly think of a harder job right now than working at Boeing. It\u2019s not just clean-up on aisle six, it\u2019s clean up the entire store, loading dock and parking lot on a daily \u2014 if not hourly \u2014 basis. And boy did Boeing have to bring out a lot of mops on Thursday. But this time, it kinda, sorta just maybe wasn\u2019t Boeing\u2019s fault. Let me explain. Boeing held a press conference from a factory in Renton, Washington, on Tuesday to talk about quality improvements. But Boeing surely knew that they\u2019d get asked about the door plug that blew off a 737 Max on an Alaska Airlines flight in January. So Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president of quality at Boeing, didn\u2019t bother beating around the bush. Lund kicked off the briefing by sharing why the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place were never installed before the plane left the factory in October: paperwork. The workers who needed to reinstall the bolts never had the work order telling them the work needed to be done, my colleagues Gregory Wallace and Chris Isidore reported. \u201cThe fact that one employee could not fill out one piece of paperwork in this condition and could result in an accident was shocking to all of us,\u201d Lund said. The lack of paperwork was not new information. It was previously disclosed in testimony before the US Senate Commerce Committee by none other than the head of the National Transportation Safety Board, the government agency leading the investigation. But strangely enough, Boeing sharing that information itself got Boeing in trouble with the NTSB. The agency reprimanded Boeing Thursday, saying it had \u201cblatantly violated\u201d the agency\u2019s rules. The violation, per an NTSB statement, was sharing \u201cinvestigative information\u201d and giving \u201can analysis of factual information previously released.\u201d This would basically be like your friend making a public Instagram announcement saying she\u2019s pregnant, prompting you to post on your story saying something like, \u201cMy best friend is going to be a mom!\u201d And then the friend sends you an angry text demanding you take it down because it\u2019s private information and you aren\u2019t allowed to comment on it. \u201cAs a party to many NTSB investigations over the past decades, few entities know the rules better than Boeing,\u201d the NTSB said (yeah, government agencies throw shade too sometimes). But the NTSB is taking matters even further, saying it will no longer share any information generated by the NTSB during its investigation and that it would be referring Boeing\u2019s conduct to the Department of Justice, meaning there could be a potential criminal probe. The NTSB declined to provide any further comment to CNN. Clean up, clean up everybody everywhere When the NTSB\u2019s statement went out, Boeing\u2019s PR team went back into crisis clean-up mode. I admit it\u2019s hard to take anything they say at face value, and part of my job as a journalist is to be skeptical and question any claims PR people make. But I think there\u2019s an ounce (okay, maybe closer to a quarter ounce) of truth in Boeing\u2019s response to the NTSB. It said it held the briefing in an effort to \u201ctake responsibility\u201d and be transparent, adding that it \u201cshared context on the lessons we have learned from the January 5 accident.\u201d \u201cWe deeply regret that some of our comments, intended to make clear our responsibility in the accident and explain the actions we are taking, overstepped the NTSB\u2019s role as the source of investigative information,\u201d Boeing said Thursday. Without giving Boeing too much credit, at least some executives were trying to take a sliver of ownership. But apparently, that\u2019s an NTSB violation. At the same time, rules are rules no matter how hypocritical they are. Boeing probably should have treaded more carefully. When CNN reached out to Boeing, a spokesperson responded, \u201cWe defer to the NTSB for information regarding the investigation.\u201d The irony in all this is the NTSB\u2019s reaction is distracting from the more glaring story here: how a simple thing like a lack of paperwork may have endangered a plane full of people.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/business/boeing-ntsb-violation-absurdity/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "chipotle-portion-sizes-smaller-test", "text": "Leave it to a Wells Fargo restaurant analyst to decisively settle the Chipotle burrito \u201cweight debate.\u201d On TikTok, some customers accused Chipotle of skimping on food portions. They started a trend of filming Chipotle employees as the workers built out their burritos order with chicken, guacamole and other add-ons in an effort to get larger scoops. The trend, dubbed the \u201cChipotle phone method,\u201d went viral on social media, and some employees pushed back on it, saying customers filming them was \u201cstressful and dehumanizing.\u201d Chipotle\u2019s CEO eventually addressed the issue. \u201cThe portions have not gotten smaller,\u201d Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol recently told Fortune. \u201cWe always want to give people big portions that get them excited about the food.\u201d He said that if customers want a little more rice or another topping, they can ask an employee. So Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem went out to Chipotle to do some investigative work. Fadem and his team ordered and weighed 75 burrito bowls with white rice, black beans, chicken, pico de gallo, cheese and lettuce across 8 Chipotle locations in New York City. (They brought them back to the office for other Wells Fargo employees\u2019 lunch.) The analysts found that the consistency of the portions varied widely. The bowls weighed roughly the same for in-store orders and online orders, but some locations served bowls that weigh 33% more than other locations. Some burrito bowls went to extremes, with one topping out at 27 ounces in one location, and a meager 14 ounces in another. The median weight was around 21.5 ounces. Laurie Schalow, Chipotle\u2019s chief corporate affairs officer, told CNN that Chipotle\u2019s bowl size may vary depending upon the number of ingredients a customer selects or if they choose to make an ingredient extra or light. She said the company has not changed its portion sizes. Portion size consistency is important for restaurants because it helps them manage costs and prevent from running out of ingredients or having too much left over. Customers go to restaurant chains for consistency, and if portion sizes are not standardized it could hurt a chain\u2019s reputation, analysts say. Many brands have been criticized for shrinking their product sizes and charging the same or more, known as \u201cshrinkflation.\u201d This does not seem to be hurting Chipotle, however. Despite the social media complaints, Chipotle\u2019s sales grew 7% last quarter, and the company\u2019s sales are outpacing rivals such as McDonald\u2019s.", "source": "http://cnn.com/chipotle-portion-sizes-smaller-test/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_economy_us-pce-inflation-fed-consumer-spending-may", "text": "Prices in the US didn\u2019t rise in May, lending a welcome reprieve to cost-wary Americans and helping to bring inflation even closer to normal levels. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index \u2014 a closely watched inflation gauge that the Federal Reserve uses for its 2% target \u2014 was unchanged from April and slowed to 2.6% for the 12 months ended in May from 2.7% the month before, according to Commerce Department data released Friday. It\u2019s the first time since November that prices didn\u2019t increase on a monthly basis. Cheaper prices at the pump certainly helped (energy prices were down 2.1% for the month) and falling goods prices (down 0.4%) helped to slow overall inflation, according to the report. Food prices increased just 0.1%. Even when taking volatile food and energy prices out of the equation, the downward trajectory was clear: The core PCE price index showed prices ticking up just 0.1% for the month, the slowest pace since November, and pulling the annual rate down to a fresh three-year low of 2.6% from 2.8%. \u201cInflationary pressures are easing overall, and I think the fear and the scare of the first quarter [when inflation heated back up] is now well behind us,\u201d Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CNN in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the right types of dynamics when it comes to inflation.\u201d The outlook is even rosier if you want to get \u201cnerdy\u201d with the data, Daco noted, adding that the unrounded indexes show increases of 2.56% for headline PCE and 2.57% for core, he said. Friday\u2019s report was in line with economists\u2019 expectations. Consumers are a \u2018little bit more prudent\u2019 The Commerce Department\u2019s monthly Personal Income and Outlays report also includes critical data on how Americans earn, spend and save. And what May\u2019s data showed was a more cautious and prudent \u2014 but far from stingy \u2014 consumer, Daco said. Consumer spending, which is a significant driver of economic activity, increased 0.2% for the month, accelerating from 0.1% the month before. Excluding inflation, real spending grew 0.3%. Spending was strong on goods, especially in the areas of recreational vehicles, as well as non-durables like clothing. Services spending increased at the slowest pace in 10 months, but consumers spent freely on transportation and recreation but pulled back a little at restaurants, Daco added. \u201cIt\u2019s still consumers spending, but [they\u2019re] being a little bit more judicious, a little bit more prudent with how much they spend and what they spend on,\u201d he said. A 0.5% increase in personal income as well as disposable income (which excludes taxes) helped boost spending levels. As such, people were able to put more money away: The personal savings rate ticked up to 3.9%, its highest level since January. Earlier this month, doubt was cast on the strength of that economic engine when retail sales data showed a lower-than-anticipated increase for May. While cheaper gas prices factored into the overall pullback, the modest gain raised some alarm bells that Americans were finally close to being tapped out. \u201cThe report couldn\u2019t have been much better for the economy at this stage, as consumers banked an income boost while inflation stayed flat from the previous month,\u201d Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a statement. \u201cMore income is key to improving spending, which has been lackluster recently, and weaker inflation gives the Fed more leeway to cut rates, especially if the job market flags.\u201d The Fed\u2019s next move Americans have been dealing with above-average \u2014 and, for a good stretch, decades-high \u2014 inflation for going on three years now. The strong and resilient job market helped households stay afloat, contributed to continued spending and kept a recession at bay; however, pervasive and prolonged inflation have sapped away precious dollars and worn down people\u2019s psyches in the process. And in an election year, those effects are top of mind for voters and factored heavily into Thursday night\u2019s first presidential debate. Consumer confidence readings have been depressed since inflation began its rapid ascent in early 2021. On Friday, the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index held mostly steady with May, dipping by a \u201cscant and statistically insignificant\u201d 0.9 index points to 68.2, its lowest reading of the year. Economists have said that slowing inflation combined with the ongoing softening in economic growth could likely ensure at least one Fed rate cut this year. Interest rates currently are at a 23-year high as a result of the central bank\u2019s aggressive campaign to tame inflation. \u201cThis is the lowest monthly core inflation increase that we\u2019ve seen this year and it furthers the narrative that the disinflationary trend that stalled during the first quarter is back to life again,\u201d Olu Sonola, Fitch Ratings\u2019 head of US economic research, said in commentary issued Friday. \u201cCore inflation is now below the year-end median estimate that was penciled in at the last [Fed meeting]. If the trend we saw this month continues consistently for another two months, the Fed may finally have the confidence necessary for a rate cut in September.\u201d The May PCE data boosted investors\u2019 optimism for a September rate cut. On Friday morning, the probability increased to 61.1% from Thursday\u2019s 59.5% for the federal funds rate moving a quarter-point lower, according to the CME FedWatch tool.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/economy/us-pce-inflation-fed-consumer-spending-may/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_business_criminal-record-chance-of-being-hired", "text": "Even before a jury found Donald Trump guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the so-called \u201chush money\u201d trial in New York, many Americans were surprised to learn that having a criminal conviction would not automatically disqualify someone from serving as president of the United States, should they be elected. But the US Constitution doesn\u2019t disallow it. In fact, for many if not most jobs, there are no legal prohibitions on hiring those with criminal records. Nevertheless, many employers are reluctant to do so. So if Trump was\u00a0looking for the types of jobs that\u00a0tens of millions of other Americans with criminal records\u00a0apply for, he\u2019d likely find the same roadblocks they face during their job search. Criminal records can include anything from serious crimes, like a murder conviction, to something far more minor\u2014 such as an arrest in a case where the charges were dropped or the person was acquitted. Whatever the situation, \u201cPeople simply don\u2019t seem to want to deal with a criminal record of any kind, even if the charges were dropped,\u201d said Margaret Love, executive director of the Collateral Consequences Resource Center, which keeps track of federal and state laws that address the restoration of rights for those who have been arrested or convicted of crimes. Background checks can kill job prospects With the exception of certain industries, such as banking or health care, or certain types of public sector jobs, employers aren\u2019t legally required to run background checks on job candidates. Yet most do anyway. And when a criminal record of any kind turns up, that can kill a person\u2019s chances, regardless of how well-qualified they may be for a position, either because an employer has a high aversion to risk or a bias against those with a record, Love said. \u201cThere is a patchwork of formal laws or rules that may bar people from some kinds of employment. But mostly the problem has become a less formal one and manifests through widespread background checking.\u201d This, despite a labyrinth of laws and regulatory guidance at the federal, state and local levels aiming to give those with criminal records a fairer shake as job candidates. The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, for instance, requires employers that consider criminal records in their hiring decisions to \u201cassess whether the record is relevant to the job\u201d by looking at the type and seriousness of the offense or crime; how long ago it was committed or when the sentence was completed. There are also at least 37 states and over 150 cities and counties that \u201chave taken steps to remove barriers to employment for qualified workers with records. Of those jurisdictions, 15 states, the District of Columbia, and 21 cities and counties extend their fair chance hiring policies to private employment,\u201d according to the National Employment Law Project. But there are no blanket provisions or prohibitions across the board. \u201cLaws vary in what they require of employers. \u2026 And a lot of places don\u2019t require anything at all,\u201d said Beth Avery, a senior staff attorney at NELP. \u201cEven the strongest of laws is aimed at getting someone\u2019s foot in the door \u2013 and that\u2019s not enough.\u201d For instance, Avery said, states with the strongest laws prohibit employers from doing a background check until after they make a job offer to a candidate. And even then, employers may still rescind the job offer. That\u2019s what happened to a client of Sabina Crocette, a senior staff attorney in the Racial Economic Justice Program at the group Legal Aid at Work in San Francisco. Her client had convictions from 2007 when he was young, but nothing since. His convictions were dismissed in 2017 after he\u2019d gotten a business education at a community college and engaged in other rehabilitative activities, Crocette said. He applied for a bank job in the past two years, after getting licensed to be a mortgage loan broker and having worked for a year in financial services. The bank gave him a job offer, pending a background check. \u201cWhen it came back showing dismissed convictions, he was denied the job,\u201d Crocette said. \u201cThe employer cited his conviction history. When he appealed the employer\u2019s decision and provided them with evidence of record clearing, the employer still denied employment.\u201d In explaining its rejection, the bank cited a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulation known as Section 19, which Crocette said the firm misinterpreted. After being rejected twice, the client persisted. \u201cWith the help of California\u2019s Fair Chance Act, as well as the actual language and guidance within Section 19, the client was able to be hired and continues to work successfully for that employer,\u201d she said. While the end result was a good one for the client, it\u2019s not typical and the whole experience took roughly eight months to resolve. \u201cIt was a lot,\u201d Crocette noted. Even with relatively strong laws, \u2018massive\u2019 problems persist In addition to California, New York is one of the states that has some of the strongest laws geared toward helping people with criminal records get a job. But even so, \u201cthere are still massive, massive problems,\u201d said Jason Hoge, supervising attorney for the Legal Assistance of Western NY (LawNY) Reentry Project. Employers \u2014 especially smaller ones \u2014 may wrongly assume they can\u2019t hire one of his clients because of a past conviction, Hoge said. Or the paperwork and time required to get approval for someone with a criminal record may be such that an employer simply decides to look at candidates without a record. \u201cSometimes people believe they are required to turn my clients down because of a criminal conviction. Sometimes you have straight-up discrimination [as in] \u2018I\u2019m never going to hire someone with a criminal record.\u2019 [Or sometimes] they use criminal records as cover for race discrimination,\u201d Hoge said, alluding to the disparities in US society that result in Blacks being more likely to be arrested and jailed than Whites with similar charges and criminal histories. Hoge recommends that anyone who has ever had even a minor run in with the law get their own copy of their criminal record and take steps to correct any mistakes before an employer pulls it. Every state will have a recordkeeper similar to New York\u2019s Division of Criminal Justice Services. Check to see what laws and regulations your state or city has on the books that can offer you protections during the job search process. For example, in November, New York\u2019s Clean Slate Act will go into effect. That law provides for eligible conviction records to be automatically \u201csealed,\u201d meaning they should no longer show up on employer background checks. And just this month, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore issued a pardon for 175,000 misdemeanor convictions related to cannabis possession.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/business/criminal-record-chance-of-being-hired/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_business_walgreens-closures", "text": "Walgreens is set to close a substantial number of its roughly 8,600 locations across the United States as the company looks to reset the struggling pharmaceutical chain\u2019s business. The company didn\u2019t announce a specific number of store closures, but it said Thursday that it is planning \u201csignificant\u201d closures of underperforming\u00a0stores across America as part of a multiyear optimization program. CEO Tim Wentworth said on a call with analysts Thursday that \u201cchanges are imminent\u201d for the roughly 25% of stores that aren\u2019t profitable and Walgreens\u2019 strategic review will \u201cinclude the closure\u00a0of a significant\u00a0portion of these underperforming stores.\u201d \u201cWe are at a point where the current pharmacy model is not sustainable and the challenges in our operating environment require we approach the market differently,\u201d he said. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal Thursday, Wentworth said the closures would focus on locations that aren\u2019t profitable, too close to each other or stores struggling with theft. Walgreens revealed few additional details about the closures on the call, but said they would take place over the next three years. The company also said it will consider additional closures if performance doesn\u2019t improve. The \u201cvast majority\u201d of employees working at affected stores will be offered jobs elsewhere, Wentworth said. Stock plunges on weak outlook Walgreens\u2019 (WBA) shares fell 20% to its lowest level in decades. The company also said in its earnings statement that it has slashed its full-year profit outlook. \u201cWe continue to face a difficult operating environment, including persistent pressures on the\u00a0US\u00a0consumer and the impact of recent marketplace dynamics which have eroded pharmacy margins,\u201d Wentworth said in a press release. \u201cOur results and outlook reflect these headwinds.\u201d Inflation has taken a big bite out of the drug store business \u2013 both at the front-end and the back-end of pharmacies. Shoppers are \u201cbecoming increasingly selective\u00a0and price sensitive\u00a0on their selections,\u201d Wentworth said on the call, adding that he forecasts the \u201coperating environment to remain challenging\u201d in the US and doesn\u2019t \u201cexpect an improvement.\u201d Sales rose 2.6% to $36.4 billion for the quarter. That might not \u201clook unreasonable, but this is running below inflation and, across some segments of the business, represents a loss of market share,\u201d Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in a note. Particularly concerning for Walgreens was its retail sales falling 4% for the quarter. But that isn\u2019t surprising because it\u2019s front-of-store struggles have been \u201cexacerbated by the cost-of-living crisis which has seen customers curtailing the volume of products they buy and shopping around more for the best deals and bargains,\u201d Saunders added. Walgreens slashed prices on more than 1,000 items in May, following rivals in an effort to lure back inflation-weary shoppers turned off by high prices. But the company said Thursday that would hurt its profitability. Struggles for drug stores Major drugstore chains, including CVS (CVS) and Rite Aid, have struggled in recent years because of declining profits from filling prescriptions. They\u2019ve declined because of lower reimbursement rates for prescription drugs and new competition from Amazon. The front end of drugstores, where they sell snacks and household staples, also face pressure from larger competitors, including Target and dollar stores. Wentworth said in the call that Walgreens\u2019 store assortment will change and it has removed eight national brands and instead started selling similar items produced by its house brands or \u201cpreferred partners.\u201d He didn\u2019t specify which brands that have been eliminated, but said it was within the health and wellness categories. Although drugstores benefited during the pandemic from people getting Covid-19 vaccines, fewer consumers are visiting stores to shop. Prescription volumes are also falling because people are getting fewer elective procedures. GLP-1 drugs, which include Ozempic and Mounjaro to treat weight loss and diabetes hasn\u2019t been a boon for the chain. Wentworth told the Journal it\u2019s losing money on filling those prescriptions. Pivoting the business model hasn\u2019t helped, either. Walgreens will no longer have a majority stake in VillageMD, a primary care network that the chain once had major plans to open full-service doctors\u2019 offices in hundreds of its stores. Walgreens said the value of its ill-fated VillageMD merger has fallen so much, it was forced to take a massive $6 billion writedown on its balance sheet. In the past few years, CVS has closed about 900 locations and Rite Aid, which entered bankruptcy in October, closed more than 100. \u2013CNN\u2019s Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/business/walgreens-closures/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events.

According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens.

Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions.

{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_business_southwest-closed-runway", "text": "Airport employees in Portland, Maine, were forced to clear out of the way when a\u00a0Southwest\u00a0Airlines jet on the morning of June 25 took off from a closed runway, according to air traffic control recordings. Controllers and pilots warned the crew of\u00a0Southwest\u00a04805 several times that the runway was closed, the recordings made by LiveATC.net show.\u00a0The incident is now under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration, and\u00a0Southwest\u00a0says it is engaged with both regulators. For the last several months the runway has been closed overnight for a taxiway construction project, and it reopens each morning at 5:45 a.m., according to the Portland International Jetport. A controller said on the recordings that the tower is also closed overnight. \u201cThere\u2019s an airport vehicle,\u201d one voice warned over the radio. Said another:\u00a0 \u201cThe\u00a0Southwest\u00a0pulling on to 29, just so you know there is a vehicle on the runway and it is still closed.\u201d But the\u00a0Southwest\u00a0pilots apparently never heard the warnings.\u00a0 They were recorded communicating on a different radio frequency with regional air traffic controllers near Boston.

{"id": "2024_06_27_business_boeing-cause-alaska-air-door-plug", "text": "For months, missing paperwork has hindered the investigation into how a door plug blew off a 737 Max on an Alaska Airlines flight in January, making it difficult to find out who made the near tragic mistake. This week, Boeing disclosed that the paperwork may have caused the problem in the first place. It was already well known that no documentation was found to show who worked on the door plug, which came off the plane after it had reached around 16,000 feet in the air causing an uncontrolled decompression, which injured a few passengers and even tore one\u2019s shirt off. But at a briefing for journalists at Boeing\u2019s 737 Max factory in Renton, Washington, Boeing said that the lack of paperwork is why the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place were never installed before the plane left the factory in October. The workers who needed to reinstall the bolts never had the work order telling them the work needed to be done. Without the bolts, the door plug incident was pretty much inevitable. Luckily, it wasn\u2019t fatal. It\u2019s a sign of the problems with the quality of work along the Boeing assembly lines. Those problems have become the focus of multiple federal investigations and whistleblower revelations, and the cause of delays in jet deliveries that are causing headaches for airlines and passengers around the globe. Boeing may have stepped in it\u2026 again But Boeing may have landed itself in even more trouble with regulators for divulging the details at this stage. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reprimanded Boeing Thursday for releasing \u201cnon-public investigative information\u201d to the media. It said in a statement that the company had \u201cblatantly violated\u201d the agency\u2019s rules. \u201cDuring a media briefing Tuesday about quality improvements\u2026 a Boeing executive provided investigative information and gave an analysis of factual information previously released. Both of these actions are prohibited,\u201d the NTSB said. Boeing will no longer have access to information generated by the NTSB during its investigation, the agency said, adding it was referring Boeing\u2019s conduct to the Department of Justice. \u201cAs a party to many NTSB investigations over the past decades, few entities know the rules better than Boeing,\u201d the NTSB said. In a letter sent to Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun Thursday, NTSB Office of Aviation Safety Director Timothy LeBaron said this week\u2019s media briefing was done without the consent or knowledge of the regulator. \u201cBoeing must take all reasonable steps to ensure that investigative information is protected from public release,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSuch a release or withholding of critical information from our investigators are blatant violations of NTSB\u2019s regulations.\u201d Boeing responded that it held the briefing in an effort to \u201ctake responsibility\u201d and be transparent for its role in the incident. It said it \u201cshared context on the lessons we have learned from the\u00a0January 5\u00a0accident.\u201d \u201cWe deeply regret that some of our comments, intended to make clear our responsibility in the accident and explain the actions we are taking, overstepped the NTSB\u2019s role as the source of investigative information,\u201d said Boeing\u2019s statement. \u201cWe apologize to the NTSB and stand ready to answer any questions as the agency continues its investigation.\u201d The NTSB also chastised Boeing for stating earlier this month that a rare, unsafe back-and-forth roll during a Southwest 737 Max flight in May was not because of a design or manufacturing error. The NTSB, which is investigating that incident, told Calhoun Thursday it had not made a determination yet and Boeing and the NTSB must speak with one voice when making public statements. Bad paperwork trail Boeing said during the Tuesday briefing that the reason the Alaska Air door plug was not probably secured in the first place was because two different groups of employees at the plant were charged with doing the work, with one removing and the other reinstalling the door plug as the plane was passing along the assembly line. The first group of employees removed the door plug to address problems with some rivets that were made by a supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. But they didn\u2019t generate the paperwork indicating they had removed the door plug, along with\u00a0the four bolts necessary to hold it in place, in order to do that work. When a different group of employees put the plug back in place, Boeing says the employees didn\u2019t think the plane would actually fly in that condition. Instead, they were just blocking the hole with the plug to protect the inside of the fuselage from weather as the plane moved outside to a different area of the factory compound. That group of employees often makes those kind of temporary fixes. \u201cThe doors team closes up the aircraft before it is moved outside, but it\u2019s not their responsibility to install the pins,\u201d said Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president of quality for Boeing\u2019s commercial airplane unit. Those employees likely assumed paperwork existed showing that the plug and bolts had been removed, and that paperwork would prompt someone else along the line to install the bolts. But without the paperwork, no one on the assembly line knew that the door plug had ever been removed, or that its bolts were missing, Lund said. Removing a door plug after a plane arrives from Spirit AeroSystems rarely happens, Lund added, so no one was aware the door plug needed attention. \u201c(Permanent) reinstallation is done by another team based on the paperwork showing what jobs are unfinished,\u201d Lund said. \u201cBut there was no paperwork, so nobody knew to follow up.\u201d An accident waiting to happen The plane actually flew for about two months with the door plug in place despite the lack of bolts. But minutes after the Alaska Airlines flight took off from Portland, Oregon, on January 5, the door plug blew out, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Passengers\u2019 clothing and phones were ripped away from them and sent hurtling into the night sky. But fortunately no passengers were seriously injured, and the crew was able to land the plane safely. The missing bolts had been identified in preliminary findings of the National Transportation Safety Board, but that report did not assess blame for the accident. And a final report is not expected for about a year or more. A spokesperson for the NTSB said that the safety agency is continuing its investigation and will not comment on Boeing\u2019s explanation for how the mistake was made. The board released a preliminary report in February that said it had found the bolts were missing when it left the Boeing factory, but it did not assess blame. A final report is not expected for a year or more. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy has testified about the missing paperwork at Congressional hearings since the preliminary report was released. Boeing is addressing the problem by slowing down its assembly lines, and making sure that planes don\u2019t advance with problems under the assumption that those problems will be dealt with later in the assembly process, Lund said. \u201cWe have slowed down our factories to make sure this is under control,\u201d she said. \u201cI am extremely confident that the actions that we took,\u201d will ensure every airplane leaving this factory is safe, she added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/business/boeing-cause-alaska-air-door-plug/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_investing_premarket-stocks-trading", "text": "President Joe Biden had a shaky performance in last night\u2019s presidential debate, triggering panic in the Democrat camp. Former President Donald Trump, meanwhile, repeated multiple falsehoods while doubling down on his record of\u00a0cutting taxes and hiking tariffs during his first presidential term. If repeated in a second Trump term, many economists fear that kind of agenda could stoke inflation at a critical moment and add to America\u2019s rapidly growing debt mountain. Markets barely blinked. What\u2019s happening: US stocks were higher in pre-market trading on Friday and CNN\u2019s Fear & Greed index remained in neutral territory for a second consecutive day as investors shrugged off a contentious presidential debate that dominated the news cycle. Investors instead opted to focus on inflation \u2014 the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index is due Friday \u2014 and the end of a strong first half of the trading year. \u201cIn the current environment, the path of inflation and interest rates, and whether the Fed can stick the soft economic landing will likely be more consequential than the election,\u201d wrote Keith Lerner, Truist\u2019s chief market strategist, in a recent analysis. Despite their different policies, under each of the past three US presidents, Barack Obama, Trump and Biden, the S&P 500 index has delivered an annual return of between 12% and 17%, Lerner said. Market volatility often heats up toward the end of an election year and then recedes, but this race is unusual because there are two incumbents running for office. That could pull the typical year-end election relief rally forward, said Ed Clissold, chief US strategist at Ned Davis Research. Investors have bigger things to worry about. \u201cStock market behavior and investor reactions in the coming days will largely hinge on the upcoming inflation data release,\u201d said Antonio Ernesto Di Giacomo, a market analyst at the brokerage xs.com, on Friday. \u201cThe PCE reading on Friday will be decisive, providing crucial insights into the future of inflation and potential Federal Reserve actions.\u201d Markets are also focused on closing out a strong first half of the year \u2014 the S&P 500 is on track to end the first six months of the year 15% higher. A strong first half typically denotes that the second half will be \u201cvery good,\u201d wrote Goldman Sachs\u2019 Scott Rubner in a recent note. Sector specific: While broad market indexes are relatively unfazed by the Biden-Trump head-to-head, certain sectors are more deeply influenced by election outcomes, said Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics. Financials and energy tend to be more susceptible to policy direction, for example. The US dollar has also been reactive \u2014 it edged higher as initial CNN polling found that Trump was viewed as the winner of the debate. That could be because Trump reiterated his desire to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, which would likely increase inflation and cast doubt on interest rate cuts. Eyes on France: Across the Atlantic, investors are less sanguine about looming political risk. French President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election after his centrist Renaissance party lost heavily to the far-right opposition in European elections. The first round of the French election will be held on Sunday, with a second round on July 7. France is running one of the highest budget deficits in the eurozone and risks falling foul of the European Commission\u2019s new\u00a0fiscal rules. Against that backdrop, markets are nervous about the populist policies being suggested by parties on the left and right. \u201cPolitical uncertainty is a near-term headwind to both sentiment (reflected through financial markets) and, now, activity,\u201d wrote Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management. Until July, \u201cwe can anticipate volatility in European equity and debt markets.\u201d While the majority of European indexes traded higher on Friday, France\u2019s benchmark, the CAC 40, was 0.3% lower. The spread between yields on French and German government debt hit its highest level since the 2012 eurozone crisis on Friday as investors worried that promised spending by France\u2019s far-right party would add to the country\u2019s already huge government debt pile. What to know about the massive car dealership outage CDK Global is still down heading into the brisk car-selling Fourth of July holiday next week. Auto dealerships use its software to manage everything from scheduling to records, and the mass outage since last week has paralyzed nearly 15,000 dealerships across North America. CDK said last Saturday that it has begun restoring its software, but both car buyers and dealers are currently at a standstill. It has suggested several times that a fix is in order, only to say then that its systems would remain out of commission for a while longer. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the massive software outage, report my CNN colleagues Ramishah Maruf\u00a0and\u00a0Eva Rothenberg. What does CDK Global do? CDK Global provides data and technology to different automotive dealerships. Its systems are used by roughly 15,000 car dealerships across the United States and Canada. CDK operates different software products car dealers use to handle workflow such as keeping records of negotiated deals, to scheduling and communicating about service. Not every dealer uses CDK\u2019s products, and those that do may not use CDK for every dealership task, but the system shutdown has been a problem for many. To protect customer privacy, customers\u2019 details aren\u2019t written out on a piece of paper that\u2019s just sitting on a desk anymore. Instead, information about deals and customer appointments is\u00a0kept in a server that\u2019s now impossible for salespeople affected by the outage to access. Can I still buy a car or get my car repaired? Salespeople and service employees who spoke with CNN say they\u2019ve resorted to using pen and paper to process purchases, which has drawn out the amount of time it takes to buy a car, according to Scott Campbell, a salesman at Capital City Buick GMC in Berlin, Vermont. He estimates wait times have doubled or tripled. Several buyers and repair customers tell CNN they\u2019ve experienced long delays. When will CDK be back online? CDK Global\u00a0doesn\u2019t believe its systems will return online before June 30. Why did systems go down? CDK has said it is working to investigate the shutdown after two cyber incidents brought its systems to a standstill. The company has not confirmed who was behind the incidents. Bloomberg\u00a0previously reported\u00a0the company was negotiating with an Eastern Europe-based hacker group demanding tens of millions of dollars in ransom to end the outage. Walgreens will close a significant number of US stores, shutting down many unprofitable locations Walgreens\u00a0is set to close a substantial number of its roughly 8,600 locations across the United States as the company looks to reset the struggling pharmaceutical chain\u2019s business, reports my colleague Jordan Valinsky. The company didn\u2019t announce a specific number of store closures, but it said Thursday that it is planning \u201csignificant\u201d closures of underperforming\u00a0stores across America as part of a multiyear optimization program. CEO Tim Wentworth said on a call with analysts Thursday that \u201cchanges are imminent\u201d for the roughly 25% of stores that aren\u2019t profitable and Walgreens\u2019 strategic review will \u201cinclude the closure\u00a0of a significant\u00a0portion of these underperforming stores.\u201d \u201cWe are at a point where the current pharmacy model is not sustainable and the challenges in our operating environment require we approach the market differently,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Nvidia, Nvidia, Nvidia. The $3 trillion tech darling has seduced investors, and its stock has risen about 750% since the beginning of 2023. But the past few days suggest that the spell the company cast over Wall Street has broken as a sudden wave of volatility briefly sent shares of the company skidding lower. Nvidia\u2019s stock bounced back Tuesday, yet investors have been reminded of a potentially bubble-bursting truth: You can fly too close to the sun. What\u2019s happening: Nvidia has had a whiplash-inducing few months. The chipmaker added a trillion dollars to its market cap, growing to $3 trillion in just 30 days from April 2024. For context, it took Warren Buffett about 60 years to build Berkshire Hathaway into a nearly trillion dollar company. On June 18, Nvidia\u2019s market value soared to $3.34 trillion, surpassing Microsoft\u2019s to become the world\u2019s most valuable company, and the stock seemed to be speeding up a one-way road to the top. Why it matters: Nvidia is solely responsible for about 35% of the S&P 500\u2019s total gains this year, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank. That makes it one of the most influential companies ever listed on the S&P 500. That\u2019s why Nvidia\u2019s plunge last week and on Monday was so jarring to investors. The stock shed a whopping $430 billion in value over the course of just three days. \u201cFirst it was the Magnificent Seven. Then it was the Fab Four. Now, a single stock is driving most of the gains in the S&P 500,\u201d said Jim Smigiel, chief investment officer at SEI. Nvidia has been like a habit investors have been unable to shake. \u201cOne question I get a lot is \u2018why don\u2019t I just put all my money in Nvidia.\u2019\u00a0I cannot really argue with that question,\u201d wrote Louis Navellier of Navellier & Associates in a recent note to investors. Then came the drop. \u201cWhat we see with Nvidia is typical volatility, which is expected when a stock rises as quickly as Nvidia\u2019s did,\u201d Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at trading platform CMC Markets, told CNN on Tuesday. But typical volatility can have seismic repercussions when it comes to a stock as all-consuming as Nvidia. Emerging from the cave: The stock was the second best performer in the entire S&P 500 Tuesday, gaining nearly 7%. That pushed its market cap back above the $3 trillion mark again. Still, the damage may already be done. \u201cNvidia\u2019s rich valuation is ludicrous \u2014 its market cap now exceeds that of the entire FTSE 100, yet its sales are less than 4% of that index,\u201d said Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO and founding partner of Bowersock Capital Partners, with reference to the 100 biggest stocks listed in London. Analysts at The Carlyle Group say that while artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the world around us, the Nvidia stock bubble will eventually burst. \u201cThe market seems quite adept at identifying transformational change but gets fixated on the hardware that facilitates it rather than the downstream value that hardware ultimately unlocks,\u201d wrote Jason Thomas, Carlyle\u2019s head of global research and investment strategy in a recent note. Yes, but: Still, enthusiasm remains high. \u201cThe fundamentals behind Nvidia\u2019s growth remain the same,\u201d Neil Roarty, analyst at investment platform Stocklytics wrote on Tuesday. \u201cIf you believe that the AI technology its chips are powering will completely recalibrate the global economy \u2014 and many do \u2014 then a $3 trillion market cap suddenly looks considerably more reasonable.\u201d The stock is up another 2.3% in premarket trading Wednesday. Levi\u2019s under fire after supplier laid off hundreds of workers Levi\u2019s is a global brand that\u00a0says\u00a0it has always stood up for \u201cwhat\u2019s right.\u201d But its claim to be an ethical company is now in question following the release of a report from an independent labor monitoring group. Critics accuse Levi\u2019s (LEVI) of ignoring its own labor standards after it continued working with a factory in Turkey that fired around 400 people last year after they joined a union and went on strike over pay and working conditions. Turkey is a critical link in the global supply chain for apparel. The country exported around $30 billion worth of apparel and textiles last year, according to the Istanbul Exporters\u2019 Association, a clothing industry group. In a statement to CNN, Levi\u2019s said it had \u201ca\u00a0longstanding commitment to supporting safe, productive workplaces for workers, and we take any allegations of efforts to curtail freedom of association extremely seriously.\u201d It said it continued sourcing jeans from the factory despite the mass firings, to avoid further job losses, but the continuation of its relationship with the supplier depends \u201con management\u2019s fulfillment of a detailed remediation plan that addresses freedom of association, working hours, and health and safety.\u201d Read more here.  \u2018Months to correct, if not years\u2019: Car dealerships and customers feel the impact as CDK outage drags on A CDK Global system outage has affected nearly every aspect of the Mazda dealership in Seekonk, Massachusetts, where Ryan Callahan is general sales manager. He says it won\u2019t be a simple fix. \u201cThe financial impact it will directly have on us will take months to correct, if not years,\u201d Callahan said. Car buyers and dealers are grappling with the shutdown of the retail software provider, which has left nearly 15,000 car dealerships across North America struggling to provide services to customers and scrambling to find temporary analog solutions to operate. CDK says it\u2019s working on restoring its systems and expects them to be back online in several days, but in the interim, customers and dealership employees remain beset by long wait times, delays \u2014 and missed chances to make or save money. Tom McParland, the owner of Automatic Consulting, a national car buying service, said the outage was impacting customers because they have fewer dealers to choose from. \u201cIt reduces their ability to get a deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt limits the customer\u2019s leverage.\u201d Read more here.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_cars_tesla-recalling-cybertruck", "text": "Tesla has issued two recalls on the Cybertruck, its third and fourth, since the model was introduced late last year. The latest recall, which includes almost all of the nearly 12,000 trucks on the road so far, involves the truck\u2019s huge single windshield wiper and a piece of plastic trim along the edge of the truck bed. A piece of black plastic trim that runs along the edge of the truck\u2019s angled bed wall can come loose and may detach from the vehicle while it\u2019s being driven. \u201cIf the applique separates from the vehicle while in drive, it could create a road hazard for following motorists and increase their risk of injury or a collision,\u201d according to documents posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration web site. The problem emerged when the piece was missing on a Cybertruck that had been transported to a delivery center on a car hauler truck, according to NHTSA documents. An investigation by Tesla revealed that the piece had not been properly installed. Further investigation revealed more cases of the trim pieces coming loose because of improper installation. Some of these cases were on Cybertrucks that had been delivered to customers. Cybertruck owners will be asked to bring their trucks to a Tesla service center where the trim piece will either be replaced or installed properly with \u201cadhesion promotor\u201d and pressure sensitive tape. Tesla will begin notifying owners of the recall in mid-August. The trucks are also being recalled for a separate issue in the electric motor that powers the truck\u2019s single huge windshield wiper. Some of the motors were damaged during testing in a way that can allow excessive electrical current to run through the motor, causing it to fail. Tesla has previously recalled the Cybertruck for other issues. In April the trucks were recalled because the accelerator pedal could become stuck down. In January, Tesla issued a software recall for 2.2 million vehicles, including Cybertrucks, because letters on warning lights were too small to easily read. That problem was fixed through an over-the-air software update.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/cars/tesla-recalling-cybertruck/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_investing_premarket-stocks-trading", "text": "The world needs more babies. Falling fertility rates have long been a concern for economists worried that aging societies could diminish the labor force, further exacerbate inflation, upend the consumer culture upon which mature economies depend and overwhelm government programs meant to care for aging populations. Those changes are now upon us. A new study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says that declining birth rates will permanently alter the demographic makeup of the world\u2019s largest economies over the next decade. What\u2019s happening: If forecasts hold up, 2064 will be the first year in modern history where the global death rate surpasses the birth rate. But the world\u2019s largest economies are already there: The total fertility rate among the OECD\u2019s 38 member countries dropped to just 1.5 children per woman in 2022 from 3.3 children in 1960. That\u2019s well below the \u201creplacement level\u201d of 2.1 children per woman needed to keep populations constant. That means the supply of workers in many countries is quickly diminishing. In the 1960s, there were six people of working age for every retired person, according to the World Economic Forum. Today, the ratio is closer to three-to-one. By 2035, it\u2019s expected to be two-to-one. Top executives at publicly traded US companies mentioned labor shortages nearly 7,000 times in earnings calls over the last decade, according to an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis last week. \u201cA reduction in the share of workers can lead to labor shortages, which may raise the bargaining power of employees and lift wages \u2014 all of which is ultimately inflationary,\u201d Simona Paravani-Mellinghoff, managing director at BlackRock, wrote in an analysis last year. And while net immigration has helped offset demographic problems facing rich countries in the past, the shrinking population is now a global phenomenon. \u201cThis is critical because it implies advanced economies may start to struggle to \u2018import\u2019 labour from such places either via migration or sourcing goods,\u201d wrote Paravani-Mellinghoff. By 2100, only six countries are expected to be having enough children to keep their populations stable: Africa\u2019s Chad, Niger and Somalia, the Pacific islands of Samoa and Tonga, and Tajikistan, according to research published by the Lancet, a medical journal. BlackRock\u2019s expert advises her clients to invest in inflation-linked bonds, as well as inflation-hedging commodities like energy, industrial metals and agriculture and livestock. What it means: CEOs and politicians are already preparing for the baby bust. Elon Musk, father of 12 children, has remarked that falling birthrates will lead to \u201ca civilization that ends not with a bang but a whimper, in adult diapers.\u201d While his words are incendiary, they\u2019re not entirely wrong. P&G and Kimberly-Clark, which together make up more than half of the US diaper market, have seen baby diaper sales decline over the past few years. But adult diapers sales, they say, are a bright spot in their portfolios. Other companies are also pivoting toward an older demo. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s chief executive, Mark Schneider, recently said he\u2019s shifted the company\u2019s priorities from producing infant formula to serving the nutritional needs of people over the age of 50. Overstretched governments: French President Emmanuel Macron in January announced a plan for \u201cdemographic rearmament\u201d in his country through fertility testing and more parental leave. Former President Donald Trump also recently promised that, if elected, he would support \u201cbaby bonuses for a new baby boom\u201d in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported that the US birth rate in 2023 fell to a record low, reversing a small uptick seen during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is also predicting that deaths will outnumber births just over 15 years from now. Those findings underpin the agency\u2019s economic forecast and budget projections, said Molly Dahl, a senior advisor at the CBO. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is increased spending on programs like Medicare and Social Security as the baby boomers are aging into those programs. And then of course, fewer workers relative to the number of people who are receiving Social Security and Medicare benefits,\u201d said Dahl. Social Security payments still provide about 90% of income for more than a quarter of older adults in the United States, according to Social Security Agency surveys. But without intervention, the Social Security trust fund will be depleted by the mid-2030s, meaning that only a portion of retirees\u2019 expected benefits will be paid out. The AI solution: Some business leaders and technologists see the boom in productivity through artificial intelligence as a potential solution. \u201cHere are the facts. We are not having enough children, and we have not been having enough children for long enough that there is a demographic crisis, former Google CEO and executive chairman Eric Schmidt said at the Wall Street Journal\u2019s CEO Council Summit in London last year. \u201cIn aggregate, all the demographics say there\u2019s going to be a shortage of humans for jobs. Literally too many jobs and not enough people for at least the next 30 years,\u201d Schmidt said. But, he said, artificial intelligence will ease those problems significantly. A recent report by Goldman Sachs predicted that generative AI could raise global GDP by as much as 7% over a 10-year period. Still, some experts say it\u2019s too soon to tell how AI will impact the global economy. A recent study by analysts at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond concluded that artificial intelligence could increase labor productivity between 1.5% and 18% over the next decade. \u201cThis ranges from barely noticeable to substantial,\u201d they said. The long-term solution to declining fertility rates, said Stefano Scarpetta, director for employment, labour and social affairs at the OECD, is to promote more gender equality and fairer sharing of work and childrearing. That also means more paid parental leave and financial support. In the meantime, he said \u201cthis is not just a temporary blip.\u201d Companies and governments need to prepare now for what he calls a \u201clow-fertility future.\u201d China warns against \u2018vicious cycle\u2019 of decoupling from the West Chinese Premier Li Qiang has warned against a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d of economic decoupling from the West, as Beijing struggles to contain rising global pushback over soaring electric vehicle (EV) exports, report my CNN colleagues Juliana Liu\u00a0and Joyce Jiang. Speaking to international executives at the \u201cSummer Davos\u201d forum in the northeastern city of Dalian on Tuesday, Li also defended his country against accusations that\u00a0Chinese overcapacity\u00a0in key green industries has led to dumping of products such as EVs and solar panels on global markets. \u201cIf countries only consider maximizing their own interests, if we ignore the interests of others, and even go back in history and engage in decoupling \u2026 it will only raise the economic operating costs of the entire society and the world,\u201d he said. This will \u201cdrag countries \u2026 into a vicious cycle of scrambling for a cake that becomes smaller and smaller,\u201d Li added. \u201cThis is something that we don\u2019t want to see.\u201d The remarks by China\u2019s second most powerful leader after Xi Jinping come a day after Canada became the latest Western country to consider\u00a0imposing\u00a0tariffs on EVs made in China. The Canadian government said on Monday that its workers faced \u201cunfair competition\u201d from Beijing\u2019s \u201cstate-directed policy of overcapacity.\u201d It will begin a 30-day public consultation period next month to assess possible responses. Last month, the Biden administration\u00a0quadrupled tariffs\u00a0on EV imports from China, from 25% to 100%, aiming to protect American jobs and manufacturing. Chinese EV sales to the United States are tiny. Prosecutors urge Justice Department to file criminal charges against Boeing over 737 Max Prosecutors are urging the US Justice Department to file criminal charges against Boeing for safety issues surrounding its 737 Max, although top Justice Department officials haven\u2019t made a final decision, a source familiar with the development tells CNN. The possible criminal charges are just the latest severe blow to the reputation of Boeing, a company once known for the quality and safety of its commercial jets. Beyond two fatal crashes of the 737 Max in 2018 and 2019, the company has faced a series of questions about the safety and quality of its jets. In January, a door plug on a 737 Max flown by Alaska Air blew out early in a flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet, further damaging Boeing\u2019s reputation. The Justice Department and Boeing had reached an agreement in January of 2021 to settle charges that alleged the company defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the certification process of the 737 Max before it could carry its first passengers. The plane started service in 2017, but suffered two fatal crashes \u2013 in October 2018 and March of 2019 \u2013 which led to a 20-month grounding of the jet. The cause of the crashes proved to be a design flaw, Boeing has admitted. Read more here.

{"id": "2024_06_25_food_perkins-new-name-remodel", "text": "At 66 years old, Perkins Restaurant and Bakery is due for a touch up. The diner chain, best known for its pies and pancakes, is getting a major makeover that includes a new logo and name, a redesign of its nearly 300 restaurants as well as a revamped menu, which still emphasizes value, with refreshed ingredients in hopes of attracting new customers that have forgotten about the chain. Perkins\u2019 changes come as similarly aged rivals, like Cracker Barrel, are facing struggles to remain relevant, especially with older diners that have changed their habits following Covid-19 as well as surging menu prices that are forcing people to eat more affordably at home because grocery prices are rising at a slower pace. The whole \u201cnew vibe,\u201d as Perkins President Toni Ronayne describes it, comes from its research that \u201cguests want the American classics of yesterday in a place that feels like today.\u201d First, the name is changing to \u201cPerkins American Food Co.\u201d making it more encompassing of what it offers. That means \u201cbakery,\u201d which has been part of its moniker for the past five decades, is disappearing but the bakery will still exist in its restaurants. The refreshed name \u201creally speaks to our American values and the American comfort food we deliver,\u201d Ronayne told CNN. \u201cWe felt this was a more modern, fresh and relevant vibe to start connecting with new consumers, while also servicing our guests that are tried-and-true Perkins loyalists.\u201d Along with the new name, the company will freshen up the green used in its logo with a new lighter version that \u201cleans into a more of heritage palette that still feels modern.\u201d The refreshed logo will also keep a retro feel. Restaurants will be remodeled in the coming years to reflect the changes, with the bakery still front and center near the entrance. The drab coloring that was part of its 2013 renovations is going away. Meanwhile, new digital menu boards will hang above the bakery. Modern subway tiles will line its walls along with brighter flooring, new tables, silverware and uniforms. Perkins didn\u2019t reveal costs of the renovations for franchisees, but Ronayne said it hopes to grow the chain\u2019s footprint with new versions that are more affordable to build. (A new location showcasing all the changes opens in Orlando, Florida, later this year.) The menu is also getting tweaked, with eaters seeing that roll out over the next several months. Perkins hope new hamburgers and updated ingredients in other foods, , such as new seasoning on its french fries, will help convince customers that it isn\u2019t just for breakfast and pies. For example, a construction of a new Perkins is now 3,500 square feet (a reduction of 6,000 square feet) with smaller kitchens and dining rooms. It\u2019s also piloting an even smaller prototype, dubbed \u201cPerkins Express,\u201d for spaces where a traditional restaurant can\u2019t fit like airports or mall food courts. Perkins has positioned itself for eaters on a budget, with a variety of platters that includes a main and a few side dishes. Although that won\u2019t drastically change with the new menus, Ronayne said the chain \u201cwill continue to evolve and explore pricing in our restaurants and in our menu items ensuring that we\u2019re able to provide value and remain competitive.\u201d \u201cWe know that value is so critical right now and we\u2019re very mindful of that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to be the leader of family dining and be able to reach guests that are looking for both value and premium options.\u201d Other breakfast-focused competitors have been feeling the economic pressure. IHOP, owned by Dine Brands (DIN), reported in its most recent earnings that same-store sales fell nearly 2% because of higher menu prices. Denny\u2019s (DENN) also reported a tough quarter because of similar problems and its stock is down nearly 35% for the year. Perkins\u2019 sales have slid about 5% every year since 2019, according to Technomic data, and several locations have closed since then. The segment is a \u201ctough one\u201d because of a number of competitors, said David Henkes, senior principal for the consulting firm. \u201cThe brand largely appeals to Baby Boomers, and I think the opportunities for Perkins lies in creating a broader brand appeal and trying to reach other dayparts and occasions,\u201d he told CNN. Perkins\u2019 problems Perkins has been privately owned by Ascent Hospitality Management since 2019, which also controls Huddle House. The firm is investing in the classic American brand that\u2019s been marred with financial issues, including two bankruptcies, following a disastrous 2006 merger with Marie Callender\u2019s. Its location count has dwindled by nearly half in recent years, customer traffic has slipped and competition from both fast food and new, fresher-looking upstarts are on the rise, according to R.J.\u00a0Hottovy, head of analytical research for\u00a0Placer.ai. \u201cPerkins has faced a number of challenges the past several years, including new sources of competition from emerging breakfast-first chains like First Watch and\u00a0consumers\u00a0shifting to more affordable options in the quick service restaurant and value grocery categories,\u201d he told CNN. Remodels of aging companies \u201csuccessfully drive increased visits by repositioning their brand, remodeling stores, and making enhancements to their menu, but usually in conjunction with an increased\u00a0emphasis on affordability or other promotional\u00a0activity,\u201d he added. Perkins is optimistic the changes, which will be highlighted in a new marketing campaign, will work. After all, Ronayne said that it\u2019s endured prior name changes: The first location opened in Cincinnati, Ohio, as Perkins Pancake House in 1958. About a decade later the company tweaked its name to Perkins Cake and Steak for a brief time before changing to its current branding. \u201cWe really feel that this iteration of \u2018Perkins American Food Co.\u2019 is going to marry tradition and innovation and keep us true to who we are,\u201d she said. \u201cWe recognize there\u2019s an opportunity for us to reach different consumers.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/food/perkins-new-name-remodel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_media_republican-debate-conspiracy-biden", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0allies in right-wing media have a problem ahead of\u00a0CNN\u2019s\u00a0presidential debate: They\u2019ve set the bar too low for\u00a0President Joe Biden. For years, and particularly over the last few months,\u00a0MAGA Media\u00a0has portrayed Biden as a senile, mentally incapacitated elderly man who cannot remember what he had for breakfast, let alone run the federal government. That might sound like an exaggeration to those who don\u2019t tune in to\u00a0Fox News\u00a0or listen to talk radio, but it has been a real and constant theme in the right-wing media universe. To support the narrative, these outlets and personalities have seized on Biden\u2019s verbal gaffes (while ignoring Trump\u2019s) and presented out-of-context video clips to their large audiences \u2014 a deceptive, but effective strategy that the Biden campaign has struggled to meaningfully rebut. Enter Thursday\u2019s high-stakes political showdown. The debate, which will be one of the most-watched moments of the 2024 presidential campaign cycle, will allow audiences from coast-to-coast the opportunity to watch an unfiltered Biden go head-to-head with Trump for some 90 minutes. While the two will undoubtedly tangle over a host of issues, the stage also will afford Biden a unique opportunity to puncture the narrative he lacks the mental fitness to be commander-in-chief. That\u2019s a worry for right-wing media figures, which risk seeing their bogus narrative about Biden being ripped up in real time. As right-wing personality\u00a0Megyn Kelly\u00a0even put it Monday, Biden will come out great if he manages to simply \u201cnot die\u201d during the face-off with Trump. \u201cThe stakes could not be lower for a Joe Biden performance,\u201d Kelly observed. To account for the looming reality in which Biden has no trouble walking on stage without the help of a handler (some in right-wing media had suggested Biden required\u00a0former President Barack Obama\u2019s\u00a0help to complete such a task), Trump\u2019s media allies are already searching for excuses. And they\u2019re getting noticeably desperate. One such claim boosted by Trump\u2019s media allies is the conspiracy theory \u2014\u00a0which lacks any evidence\u00a0\u2014 that the president will be on performance-enhancing supplements or drugs during the debate. That narrative, which was also floated after Biden\u2019s forceful\u00a0State of the Union\u00a0speech earlier this year, has been promoted by none other than Trump himself. \u201cHe\u2019s sleeping now, because they want to get him good and strong,\u201d Trump\u00a0said at a campaign rally\u00a0over the weekend. \u201cSo a little before debate time, he gets a shot in the ass.\u201d That narrative has been, predictably, amplified by Trump\u2019s media supporters, who all overlooked the fact that Trump repeatedly fell asleep mid-day at his own trial earlier this year in court. Fox News host\u00a0Jesse Watters, for instance, played into it on Monday\u2019s episode of\u00a0\u201cThe Five,\u201d\u00a0claiming Biden \u201cis going to be taking shots at the jungle juice\u201d ahead of the debate so that he can appear energetic. MAGA Media has also settled around a scapegoat to protect Trump if he should perform poorly: CNN. The dishonest pro-Trump forces, particularly the overt propagandist\u00a0Sean Hannity, have leveled a barrage of attacks aimed at\u00a0Jake Tapper, who will be co-moderating the debate alongside\u00a0Dana Bash. Tapper, the hard-hitting anchor and CNN\u2019s chief Washington correspondent, has been portrayed as a Democratic hack. While it is an absurd accusation, it is one MAGA Media is gleefully pushing, even attempting to do so on CNN\u2019s own air. On Monday morning, CNN anchor\u00a0Kasie Hunt\u00a0abruptly ended an interview\u00a0with Trump spokesperson\u00a0Karoline Leavitt, who repeatedly assailed Tapper and Bash as \u201cbiased\u201d news anchors. After booting Leavitt from her program, Hunt noted that \u201cif you\u2019re attacking the moderators, you\u2019re usually losing.\u201d Hunt is, of course, spot on. The hang-up, however, for MAGA Media is that they\u2019ve forced themselves into a corner. Now, they\u2019re trying to find a way to break free \u2014 and they\u2019re getting desperate.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/media/republican-debate-conspiracy-biden/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_media_msnbc-biden-trump-debate", "text": "On MSNBC, the mood Thursday night was somber. \u201cI am not going to put a fine sheen on it, or a spin on it, even though I am in the spin room,\u201d MSNBC anchor Alex Wagner said from the\u00a0CNN presidential debate\u00a0spin room in\u00a0Atlanta. \u201cThere\u00a0has\u00a0been a uniformly negative reaction to Biden\u2019s performance tonight.\u201d Wagner was speaking about the reaction from Democratic sources, but on the cable news channel\u00a0that\u2019s seen as the\u00a0home to America\u2019s progressive political wing, the mood\u00a0on set\u00a0was stark. \u201cThis was about revealing who Donald Trump was, but it was also Joe Biden battling a caricature of himself as an enfeebled person,\u201d Wagner said of the debate. \u201cAnd he did nothing to disabuse, I think, the country of the notion that he is very old and was lost frequently in that debate.\u201d While the\u00a0Democratic party\u00a0immediately\u00a0declared victory\u00a0following\u00a0President Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0debate with former President Donald Trump, Biden\u2019s poor performance on the CNN stage, in which the 81-year-old spoke in a hoarse and at-times unintelligible voice as Trump unleashed a flurry of lies, set off alarm bells on the left. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a DEFCON 1 moment,\u201d David Plouffe, former President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign manager, told MSNBC star Rachel Maddow following the debate. \u201cIt really pains me to say this \u2014 they are about three years apart, they seemed like 30 years apart tonight.\u201d The mood on MSNBC reflected the mood in progressive and Democratic political circles: panic and alarm. The concerns didn\u2019t end there. MSNBC host Joy Reid told viewers she was receiving messages from Democratic sources expressing anxiety about the president\u2019s performance, prompting\u00a0an open discussion of a once-unspoken idea: replacing Biden as the party\u2019s nominee. \u201cThe universal reaction was somewhere approaching panic. The people who were texting with me were very concerned about President Biden seeming extremely feeble, seeming extremely weak,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI think conversations range from whether he should be in this race tomorrow morning to what was wrong with him,\u201d anchor Nicolle Wallace said.\u00a0\u201cThere were people talking about how that process works, and that conversation is live and active at the highest levels of the Democratic party.\u201d \u201cSomeone actually sent me the rules,\u201d Reid said, referring to the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination rules. \u201cThe rules are circulating!\u201d Wallace replied. The anxieties relayed on the progressive outlet Thursday night came in sharp contrast to right-wing media\u2019s reaction to Trump\u2019s history of scandals and lies. During and after Trump\u2019s time in the White House, prominent figures on Fox News and other right-wing outlets vigorously defended the Republican in the face of two impeachments, the January 6 attack, a felony conviction and the reality that he lost the 2020 election. And while\u00a0MSNBC\u2019s hosts pointed to the flood of lies from Trump during Thursday night\u2019s debate, the conversation continually returned to Biden\u2019s performance. \u201cThe president is an avatar for the American people,\u201d\u00a0Reid said, offering support for Biden\u2019s record as president. \u201cBut you cannot become president again when America looks at you and that avatar to them looks broken.\u201d \u201cThe job of the president is making decisions. The job of a presidential candidate is to communicate. It just is. That is the job,\u201d MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes later added. \u201cI think Joe Biden has a very good record on making decisions. And I think he is a very poor communicator right now.\u201d Outside the MSNBC studio, other prominent liberal voices suggested Biden should step aside following the debate. \u201cPresident Biden is a good man who capped a long career in public service with a successful presidential term. But I hope he reviews his debate performance Thursday evening and withdraws from the race, throwing the choice of a Democratic nominee to the convention in August,\u201d\u00a0New York Times columnist\u00a0Nicholas Kristof wrote. \u201cJoe Biden had his shot\u2014a chance to dispel concerns about his age and his abilities,\u201d\u00a0David Corn wrote\u00a0in Mother Jones, the progressive website and print magazine. \u201cBut in his first debate with Donald Trump, he stumbled through 90 minutes, muffing answers, often looking uncertain, speaking in a low, gravelly voice that did not convey strength. This was not only a missed chance. It was a disaster.\u201d Mehdi Hasan, the Zeteo editor-in-chief and former MSNBC anchor, struck a similar chord. \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s got to go,\u201d\u00a0Hasan said. \u201cTonight was a car crash for the Biden presidency, for the Biden campaign. It was painful to watch at times, I\u2019m sorry, it felt like elder abuse.\u201d But while some were calling for Biden to step aside, others urged patience with the candidate as the campaign revved up to the November election. \u201cPredictably, Biden\u2019s poor performance led to some chatter about his\u00a0stepping down\u00a0and letting someone else be the nominee. This is not going to happen,\u201d\u00a0MSNBC host Symone Sanders, who advised then-candidate Biden ahead of the 2020 election,\u00a0wrote early Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s tight, but Biden still has time to make his case.\u00a0After all, presidential campaigns are about fighting all the way until the end.\u201d Debate reaction at Fox On Fox News, Trump booster Sean Hannity seemed to relish in what he called a \u201ctrain wreck\u201d although he claimed \u201cI wish it weren\u2019t so.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s over, it\u2019s done,\u201d Hannity said in the minutes after the debate wrapped. \u201cIt was almost like I was waiting at times for someone to throw in the towel. It was a \u2018no mas, no mas\u2019 moment,\u201d Hannity said. Hannity said Trump, on the other hand, \u201cwas dialed in,\u201d without mentioning the dozens of falsehoods from Trump on stage. \u201cHe stayed on message and was extraordinarily effective on pretty much every issue of substance they talked about,\u201d Hannity said. Fox host Jesse Watters joked that \u201cJoe did a great job,\u201d to chuckles from the Fox News panel. \u201cAnd I think Democrats should absolutely keep him as the nominee and run him against Donald Trump and everything will be fine,\u201d he said sarcastically, a slight smirk across his face. Watters then said he felt something he had never felt before \u2014 he felt bad for the president. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could feel empathy for Joe Biden but that\u2019s how bad it was,\u201d he said, before going on and falsely claiming the White House had \u201chidden\u201d Biden for four years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/media/msnbc-biden-trump-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_tech_microsoft-teams-eu-antitrust", "text": "Microsoft has violated European Union antitrust laws by bundling Teams with its other popular applications for businesses, EU officials said Tuesday, marking the bloc\u2019s latest challenge to a US tech giant. If confirmed, the preliminary findings of an EU investigation could lead to a fine of up to 10% of Microsoft\u2019s global revenue, which totaled $211 billion in its latest financial year. The announcement comes a day after EU regulators accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the bloc\u2019s landmark Digital Markets Act, a groundbreaking law that forced big changes on dominant tech platforms after it came into force in March. Apple, which has denied wrongdoing, also faces a huge fine if the charges are confirmed. The actions by the EU could result in changes to the way hundreds of millions of Europeans access services on some of the world\u2019s biggest digital platforms, reflecting a big push by European lawmakers to rein in the power of Big Tech. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, opened an investigation into Microsoft\u2019s software practices almost a year ago following a complaint in 2020 by the cloud-based internal messaging app Slack, which is now owned by Salesforce (CRM). Slack alleged that Microsoft (MSFT) had given Teams, which offers messaging, calling and video meetings, an unfair advantage by automatically including it with its Office software and thereby denying Slack an opportunity to compete on a level playing field. The European Commission shares Slack\u2019s worries. \u201cWe are concerned that Microsoft may be giving its own communication product Teams an undue advantage over competitors, by tying it to its popular productivity suites for businesses,\u201d the EU\u2019s competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in statement. \u201cPreserving competition for remote communication and collaboration tools is essential as it also fosters innovation on these markets. If confirmed, Microsoft\u2019s conduct would be illegal under our competition rules,\u201d she added. According to the Commission, Microsoft has been forcing customers to acquire Teams by automatically including the tool in its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites. The company\u2019s advantage over rivals \u201cmay have been further exacerbated by interoperability limitations between Teams\u2019 competitors and Microsoft\u2019s offerings. The conduct may have prevented Teams\u2019 rivals from competing, and in turn innovating, to the detriment of customers,\u201d the Commission said. Microsoft announced last year that it would stop the Teams bundling practice in Europe and extended the same commitment globally in April. But, while the Commission acknowledged that the company had started offering \u201csome suites without Teams,\u201d it said it believes \u201cmore changes to Microsoft\u2019s conduct are necessary to restore competition.\u201d In a statement, Microsoft President Brad Smith said: \u201cHaving unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission\u2019s remaining concerns.\u201d Salesforce, meanwhile, welcomed the Commission\u2019s findings, calling its actions \u201ca win for customer choice and an affirmation that Microsoft practices with Teams have harmed competition.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

The country\u2019s coalition government agreed this week to introduce the world\u2019s first carbon emissions tax on agriculture. It will mean new levies on livestock starting in 2030. Denmark is a major dairy and pork exporter, and agriculture is the country\u2019s biggest source of emissions.

The move comes just months after farmers held protests across Europe, blocking roads with tractors and pelting the European Parliament with eggs over a long list of complaints, including gripes about environmental regulation and excessive red tape. The global food system is a huge contributor to the climate crisis, producing around a third of greenhouse gas emissions. Livestock farming has a particularly big impact, accounting for around 12% of global emissions in 2015, according to the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization. A share of this pollution comes from methane, a potent planet-warming gas produced by cows and some other animals through their burps and manure. Reducing livestock emissions The tax, expected to be approved by Denmark\u2019s parliament later this year, will amount to 300 krone ($43) per tonne (1.1 ton) of CO2-equivalent emissions from livestock from 2030, rising to 750 krone ($107) in 2035. A 60% tax break will apply, meaning that farmers will effectively be charged 120 krone ($17) per tonne of livestock emissions per year from 2030, rising to 300 krone ($43) in 2035. On average, Danish dairy cows, which account for much of the cattle population, emit 5.6 tonnes of CO2-equivalent per year, according to Concito, a green think tank in Denmark. Using the lower tax rate of 120 krone results in a charge of 672 krone per cow, or $96. With the tax break in place, that levy will rise to 1,680 krone per cow in 2035 ($241). In the first two years, the proceeds from the tax will be used to support the agricultural industry\u2019s green transition and then reassessed. \u201cThe whole purpose of the tax is to get the sector to look for solutions to reduce emissions,\u201d Concito\u2019s chief economist Torsten Hasforth told CNN. For example, farmers could change the feed they use. But Danish farmers\u2019 group B\u00e6redygtigt Landbrug said the measures amounted to a \u201cscary experiment.\u201d \u201cWe believe that the agreement is pure bureaucracy,\u201d chairman Peter Ki\u00e6r said in a statement. \u201cWe recognize that there is a climate problem\u2026 But we do not believe that this agreement will solve the problems, because it will put a spoke in the wheel of agriculture\u2019s green investments.\u201d Peder Tuborgh, the CEO of Arla Foods, Europe\u2019s largest dairy group, said the agreement was \u201cpositive\u201d but that farmers who \u201cgenuinely do everything they can to reduce emissions\u201d should not be subjected to a tax. \u201cIt is essential that the tax base for a (carbon) tax is solely based on emissions for which there are means to eliminate (them),\u201d he added in statement. Kristian Hundeboll, the CEO of DLG Group, one of Europe\u2019s biggest agricultural businesses and a cooperative owned by 25,000 Danish farmers, said it was \u201ccrucial for competitiveness\u201d for the tax to be \u201canchored\u201d in European Union legislation. \u201cNeither the climate, agriculture nor the ancillary industries benefit from Denmark acting unilaterally,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

He struggled to explain what he would accomplish in a second term. He struggled to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s provocations. He struggled to hold Mr. Trump accountable for his lies, his failures and his chilling plans. More than once, he struggled to make it to the end of a sentence,\u201d the board wrote in an opinion piece published Friday. \u201cThe greatest public service Mr. Biden can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election. As it stands, the president is engaged in a reckless gamble. There are Democratic leaders better equipped to present clear, compelling and energetic alternatives to a second Trump presidency. There is no reason for the party to risk the stability and security of the country by forcing voters to choose between Mr. Trump\u2019s deficiencies and those of Mr. Biden. It\u2019s too big a bet to simply hope Americans will overlook or discount Mr. Biden\u2019s age and infirmity that they see with their own eyes,\u201d the Times also said. The board went on to say it would still support Biden as its \u201cunequivocal pick\u201d if the choice remains between him and former President Donald Trump. The Biden campaign hit back at the editorial board\u2019s critique on Friday evening. \u201cThe last time Joe Biden lost the New York Times editorial board\u2019s endorsement, it turned out pretty well for him,\u201d Biden campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond told CNN. The Times\u00a0endorsed\u00a0two Democratic presidential candidates in 2020: Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren. The New York Times is the latest to critique Biden\u2019s\u00a0debate\u00a0performance, which has set off alarm bells among top Democrats \u2014 leaving some to openly question whether Biden can stay atop of the Democratic ticket. \u201cHe seemed a little disoriented. He did get stronger as the debate went on. But by that time, I think the panic had set in,\u201d longtime Democratic operative and CNN senior political commentator David Axelrod said. Axelrod also gave voice to a conversation happening among many Democrats on Thursday night: \u201cThere are going to be discussions about whether he should continue.\u201d On MSNBC, the cable news channel\u00a0that\u2019s seen as the\u00a0home to the country\u2019s progressive political wing, anchor Alex Wagner said Thursday immediately following the debate that there had \u201cbeen a uniformly negative reaction to Biden\u2019s performance tonight.\u201d \u201cThis was about revealing who Donald Trump was, but it was also Joe Biden battling a caricature of himself as an enfeebled person,\u201d Wagner said of the debate. \u201cAnd he did nothing to disabuse, I think, the country of the notion that he is very old and was lost frequently in that debate.\u201d - CNN\u2019s Betsy Klein, Kasie Hunt, MJ Lee, Lauren Fox, Kayla Tausche, Arlette Saenz and Hadas Gold contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/media/nyt-editorial-board-biden-2024-presidential-race/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

The 90-minute debate, which\u00a0sent shockwaves\u00a0through the political world, was simulcast across 22 networks. CNN, which hosted the debate from its Atlanta studios, offered a live feed of the telecast to any network free of charge but with strict conditions over its presentation and branding. On television, CNN drew the highest single audience with 9.53 million viewers on its flagship channel, including\u00a03.379 million in the advertiser coveted 25-54 demographic,\u00a0the network said\u00a0Friday. The right-wing talk channel Fox News drew 9.276 million\u00a0viewers, ABC News saw 9.21 million viewers and MSNBC drew 4.122 million viewers. \u201cMore people watched the CNN Presidential Debate than any other CNN program in history,\u201d the network said. The debate was also the most watched non-sports program of the year so far on television. The telecast also drew the largest audience on record for CNN on the\u00a0Max\u00a0streaming service,\u00a0though the network did not disclose audience figures. While the debate drew the largest television audience of the year,\u00a0it represents over a 30% drop in\u00a0audience from 2020,\u00a0when more than 73 million people\u00a0watched the\u00a0first debate\u00a0between Trump and Biden across all television networks. In 2016,\u00a0a record 84 million\u00a0tuned in\u00a0to the first debate matchup between Hillary Clinton and Trump. While fewer Americans watched the debate on television than in previous election years, millions more watched on digital platforms. CNN said the event generated more than 30 million views on its digital properties and on YouTube. The debate was CNN\u2019s biggest event ever on its digital platforms, the network said, and was its most live-streamed event with 2.5 million streams. For CNN,\u00a0Thursday night\u2019s debate was a marketing coup, coming at a pivotal moment for the network as it works to reverse declining ratings and embarks on a strategy to revolutionize the four-decade-old network in the digital era. The previous most-watched program in CNN\u2019s history occurred in 2015, when a GOP debate featuring Trump and a slew of Republican rivals\u00a0averaged 23.1 million viewers. Thursday\u2019s\u00a0primetime matchup\u00a0was a break from\u00a0general election\u00a0debate tradition, which has long been hosted by the\u00a0nonpartisan\u00a0Commission on Presidential Debates and shared with\u00a0television\u00a0networks. While primary debates have traditionally been hosted by\u00a0individual\u00a0networks, the candidates and CNN bucked tradition by completely removing the commission from the equation, holding the debate before the candidates were even officially their party\u2019s nominees. The debate represents a much-needed shot in the arm for CNN, which has seen its ratings fall after changes to its on-air lineup and as traditional television viewers increasingly cut the cord in favor of streaming services. Presidential\u00a0election cycles typically result in a ratings bonanza for news networks as audiences tune in to watch the unfolding\u00a0race \u2014 but\u00a02024 has thus far proven to be the exception, with virtually all news outlets seeing a decline in audience since 2020. While much of the attention in the aftermath of the debate was on Biden\u2019s performance, CNN\u2019s hands-off approach to fact checking during the debate\u00a0elicited some criticism. \u201cI wish the CNN moderators did more fact-checking, letting the audience know when things are said that are flatly false,\u201d wrote New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof. \u201cNot sure how it helps for a platform to transmit falsehoods disguised as facts.\u201d Ahead of the event, CNN political director David Chalian said the network would limit fact checking from the stage, aiming to let the candidates grapple with the issues and \u201cnot become participants in that debate.\u201d Moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash took a deliberate approach to questioning, repeatedly following up when the candidates failed to answer questions and policing their allotted speaking time. At one point, Bash pressed Trump three times on whether he\u2019d accept the outcome of the 2024 election. \u201cWe are very proud of Jake and Dana,\u201d a CNN spokesperson said.\u00a0\u201cOur job was to make sure candidates were heard so voters can make informed decisions and we are pleased we were able to do that.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments and context.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/media/ratings-debate-trump-biden-cnn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_business_nyc-libraries-funding-restored", "text": "New York City officials have agreed to restore more than $111 million in funding to libraries and cultural institutions, the City Council announced Thursday. The agreement is a victory for residents and organizations who had been pushing back for months against budget cuts in the nation\u2019s largest city and one of the world\u2019s foremost cultural capitals. In November, the city announced it would cut the budget of the New York Public libraries by $58.3 million in fiscal year 2025, and slash the budget for other cultural institutions, including the Bronx Zoo and Carnegie Hall, by $53 million. The new deal reverses those cuts, and is set to be finalized in a City Council vote Sunday. \u201cWe are proud to announce a full restoration of funds to both our libraries and cultural institutions in the upcoming budget,\u201d said New York City Mayor Eric Adams in a statement Thursday. \u201cThese institutions are a critical part of New York City\u2019s social fabric, which New Yorkers depend on for their children\u2019s growth and the vibrancy of our city.\u201d Adams\u2019 office unveiled additional cultural sector cuts of $7.6 million in January, before reversing those cuts in May. \u201cOur arts and cultural institutions and libraries are foundational pillars of our city, and New Yorkers depend on their services every day,\u201d said New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, thanking the mayor\u2019s administration for reaching the deal. \u201cThe Council has consistently championed funding restorations for these institutions as a top priority, and we\u2019re proud to reach an agreement with Mayor Adams and the administration to successfully secure these critical investments for them in the city budget.\u201d The news was received with collective approval from New York institutions that had been forced to cut hours and public access due to lack of funding. \u201cThe Museum of the City of New York is delighted to learn of the restoration of cuts to the cultural sector,\u201d the museum\u2019s president Stephanie Hill Wilchfort told CNN in a statement. \u201cThis support makes it possible for MCNY to be open seven days a week, starting on July 1,\u201d said Wilchfort, who serves as Executive Vice Chair of the Cultural Institutions Group, a coalition of 34 non-profit organizations such as the city\u2019s museums, gardens, and arts centers. \u201cAs such, the Museum\u2019s exhibitions exploring history, popular culture, and art will be open to the public on Tuesdays and Wednesdays for the first time since the pandemic. City support also allows the Museum to operate as a cooling center, open at no charge to anyone who seeks relief from warm weather.\u201d The city\u2019s three public library systems \u2014 New York, Queens, and Brooklyn \u2014 issued a joint statement thanking the administration, the city council and New York residents, who overwhelmingly supported the campaign to restore library budgets. More than 174,000 people sent letters to City Hall in support of the \u201cNo Cuts to Libraries!\u201d campaign since the cuts were announced in November. \u201cThis funding will allow us to resume seven-day service, a priority for many New Yorkers,\u201d the libraries said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cWe expect that service to begin in the coming weeks, bringing our branches back to the same hours of operation prior to the November 2023 cuts. The funding also allows us to continue universal six-day service, which New Yorkers have enjoyed for nearly a decade.\u201d Not all library locations are open seven days a week, but those who did offer the service were forced to close on Sundays following the budget cuts. A flat budget amid rising costs But the budget restoration may not be enough for the libraries, which operate as publicly owned community spaces and provide residents with social services like English classes, career hubs, tax preparation centers and after school programs. While the proposed 2025 budget doesn\u2019t catastrophically gut the city\u2019s libraries, they are still facing a nominally flat budget that does not account for inflation or rising costs. Last month, the presidents of the three library systems testified before the City Council on increasing costs, including maintaining library infrastructure, providing staff with equitable wages and ensuring that there are enough physical, audio and downloadable books for the city\u2019s roughly 9 million residents. \u201cWe are running a library system today on a pre-pandemic funding level that has not kept pace with inflation,\u201d Linda Johnson, president and CEO of Brooklyn Public Library said at the time. \u201cRestoration alone will not solve our operating budget needs.\u201d Tony Marx, president of the New York Public Library reiterated those sentiments, stating that library operation costs are increasing across the board for wages, health insurance, library materials, maintaining collections and technology. \u201cWe estimate that unreimbursed cost growth next year may be more than $9 million,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/business/nyc-libraries-funding-restored/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_economy_housing-market-prices-inflation", "text": "Help may not be on the way for first-time homebuyers frustrated by high mortgage rates and even higher home prices. Economists at Bank of America warned this week that the US housing market is \u201cstuck and we are not convinced it will become unstuck\u201d until 2026 \u2014 or later. The bank said home prices will stay high and go even higher. The housing shortage will persist. And mortgage rates may not fall much \u2014 even if the Federal Reserve finally delivers long-delayed interest rate cuts. \u201cThis will take many years to work itself out. There isn\u2019t a magic fix,\u201d Michael Gapen, head of US economics at Bank of America, told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cThe message for first-time homebuyers is one of patience and frustration.\u201d Housing affordability is a major problem in America. Home prices spiked during Covid-19 and then the Fed\u2019s war on inflation sent mortgage rates surging. The one-two punch has made it a historically unaffordable time to buy a home. \u201cIt\u2019s been a weird combination. Mortgage rates rose substantially but so did home prices. That typically doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d said Gapen. The supply of homes simply cannot keep up with demand. Prices have had nowhere to go but up. The median price of a previously owned US home climbed in May for the 11th month in a row to a record $419,300 \u2014 up 6% from a year earlier. Bank of America expects home prices will climb by 4.5% this year and then by another 5% in 2025 before eventually dipping by 0.5% in 2026. \u2018Lock-in effect\u2019 could persist for eight years One major problem hurting supply is the \u201clock-in effect.\u201d People who already own their home are effectively locked into their property after refinancing or getting a mortgage during the pandemic when ultra-low rates were available. Buying now at current rates would require them to pay hundreds of dollars more per month on interest alone. Plus, home prices have gone up. For many, it just doesn\u2019t make sense to move. And because those homeowners are not moving, the supply of existing homes on the market is limited. \u201cWhy would I sell unless I have to?\u201d said Gapen. \u201cPrices have gone up and the mortgage rate is a lot higher. So, I\u2019m content to stay where I am.\u201d Bank of America warns the lock-in effect could persist for another six to eight years, keeping a lid on supply during that time. That\u2019s because the mortgage rate of people who already own is historically low. And the rate for new buyers is elevated. Bank of America doesn\u2019t think that gap will shrink much for years. This problem helps explain why pending home sales fell in May to a record low, according to data released on Thursday. Pending sales, tracked by the National Association of Realtors since 2001, are a forward-looking gauge of home sales that measures contract signings. \u2018They can\u2019t take their mortgage rate with them\u2019 Dave Liniger, who co-founded real estate giant RE/MAX with his wife in 1973, said the lock-in effect means people who want to size up to a bigger home can\u2019t, and the next generation can\u2019t even get their foot in the door for a starter property. \u201cThe move-up market does not exist,\u201d Liniger told CNN. \u201cStarter homes have doubled in value and the owners would like to move up but the problem is they can\u2019t take their mortgage rate with them.\u201d Liniger agrees that the housing market is stuck, for now at least. \u201cWe have to muddle our way through this for a period of time,\u201d he said. But Liniger urged first-time homebuyers to remain patient. \u201cDon\u2019t give up the dream,\u201d he said. In theory, a flood of supply of new homes would help unstick the market. However, Bank of America expects housing starts \u2014 which is a measure of newly constructed homes \u2014 to remain flat for the coming years. And housing starts have still not recovered from the bursting of the housing bubble in the mid-2000s. Divide between haves and have-nots The forecast for a \u201cstuck\u201d housing market cuts both ways. The spike in home prices has padded the net worth of existing homeowners and given them additional financial flexibility. But there are many Americans who are on the outside looking in. They\u2019d like to buy but can\u2019t afford to at these prices and these mortgage rates. The longer they are prevented from buying, the more time they miss out on wealth creation. In a recent Gallup poll, just 21% of Americans said it is a good time to buy a house, tied for the worst reading in Gallup history. An overwhelming majority \u2014 76% \u2014 say it\u2019s a bad time to buy. Gapen, the Bank of America economist, said if the US economy achieves the soft landing that he expects, meaning that inflation cools without triggering a recession, there is a risk that home prices will rise even more than anticipated. On the other hand, if the durability of the recovery has been overestimated and a recession is on the way, home prices could tumble and affordability would ease. \u201cBut, obviously, you don\u2019t want to go through a recession to have better housing affordability,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/economy/housing-market-prices-inflation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_economy_us-consumer-confidence-june", "text": "US consumer confidence teetered slightly in June as Americans grew a little warier about the future, new data released Tuesday showed. The Conference Board\u2019s latest consumer confidence index dipped to 100.4 in June from a downwardly revised level of 101.3 in May. June\u2019s reading landed in line with what economists were expecting but reinforced what\u2019s become a running theme: Despite continued economic growth and a historically strong labor market, Americans say their confidence has grown increasingly threadbare after a prolonged stint of high inflation and interest rates. \u201cThe details continue to demonstrate a hesitant, but not overly concerned, consumer,\u201d Wells Fargo economists Shannon Seery Grein and Jeremiah Kohl wrote in an investor note on Tuesday. Separate survey data released Tuesday by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\u2019s Consumer Finance Institute showed that while respondents maintained a net positive outlook on the economy, more than one-third of them reported concern about making ends meet in the next seven to 12 months. Measurements of Americans\u2019 confidence are typically closely watched, as consumer spending accounts for nearly 70% of US economic activity. But that significance is even more heightened now with the US presidential election just months away. Future outlook remains downbeat The Conference Board\u2019s latest report showed that Americans felt better about the labor market, which outweighed concerns about the future; however, consumers\u2019 feelings on current business conditions cooled, noted Dana Peterson, chief economist of the business membership and research organization. \u201cHowever, if material weaknesses in the labor market appear, confidence could weaken as the year progresses,\u201d she said in a statement. Consumers felt different levels of confidence around different parts of the economy. The present situations index ticked up to 141.5 (its highest level since March) from 140.8; however, the expectations index dropped to 73, marking the fifth consecutive month below 80, which the Conference Board considers as a threshold signaling a recession is ahead. The expectations index has been at or above that potential recession threshold only six months since March 2022, when escalating inflation forced the Federal Reserve to start a historic rate-tightening campaign. Inflation has cooled considerably during the past two years but is still above the central bank\u2019s 2% target. Interest rates remain at a 23-year high and have helped to tamp down demand. Although the strong jobs market has helped prop up consumer spending and kept the economy churning, the dual pressures of elevated inflation and high interest rates have weighed down some people. Credit card balances are growing and delinquencies are on the rise. The Philly Fed\u2019s latest Labor, Income, Finances, and Expectations (LIFE) Survey showed there was a sharp year-over-year increase in anxiety about making ends meet: In April 2024, 26.2% of respondents who said they could pay all their bills reported concern about being able to do so in the next six months. That\u2019s up from 20.7% in April 2023. A critical read on inflation is coming Tuesday\u2019s consumer confidence index is a reflection of a further cooling in spending growth ahead, according to Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics\u2019 chief economist. \u201cIn one line\ufeff, (the index is) consistent with slowing consumption growth and a gently rising unemployment rate,\u201d he wrote. The Conference Board\u2019s confidence index and the\u00a0University of Michigan\u2019s twice-a-month consumer sentiment index\u00a0are two of the leading gauges of consumers\u2019 attitudes toward the current and future strength of the economy. Although the two indexes typically track similarly over time, the consumer confidence index is more influenced by employment and labor market conditions, while the Michigan sentiment index has a greater emphasis on household finances and the impact of inflation. The Michigan index\u2019s preliminary reading for June, released earlier this month, showed sentiment levels were at a seven-month low. The latest, and highly critical, read on inflation will come Friday when the Commerce Department releases the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index data for May. The PCE index, which measured 2.7% in April, is the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/economy/us-consumer-confidence-june/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_business_cdk-global-cyber-attack-update", "text": "Cyberattacks seem to be more devastating than ever and taking targeted companies even longer to resolve. The latest attack to receive wide attention continues that trend: An ongoing cyber incident at CDK Global, whose software car dealerships use to manage everything from scheduling to records, has crippled dealerships for days now, with no clear end in sight. In May, a cyberattack on Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit network that includes 140 hospitals in 19 states, forced the system to divert ambulances from several of its hospitals. It took almost a month to fully resolve the issue. And in February ransomware attack on Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of healthcare giant UnitedHealth Group, caused billing disruptions at pharmacies across the US and\u00a0threatened to put\u00a0some health providers out of business. Experts say hackers are getting more sophisticated and can hide in  an organization\u2019s systems for longer undetected. These hackers target companies in a supply chain-style attack, taking down entire industries to leverage more money. And certain industries that often use outdated systems, like healthcare, are becoming even easier targets. \u201cWe can\u2019t even compare what was going on ten years ago to what\u2019s going on today,\u201d Dror Liwer, co-founder of cybersecurity company Coro, told CNN. \u201c(Hackers) are in the game for much bigger gains than they were before.\u201d Why hacks are so much more devastating Hackers are not just more sophisticated, but they\u2019re also more patient, Liwer said. Hackers hide themselves inside an organization\u2019s framework for a while, and move laterally through that framework, affecting numerous parts of the system. They wait until it\u2019s the right time to launch attacks. And the longer the hackers wait, the bigger the damage. \u201cWhen (hackers) turn the attack on and execute, it\u2019s truly crippling to the organization which then generates more revenue for them,\u201d Liwer said. Experts with whom CNN spoke said it\u2019s difficult to get specific details on individual cyberattacks immediately. For one thing, companies want to protect their brand reputation from potential litigation. Also, organizations may not want to reveal specific details of the attack before an investigation concludes, the experts said, in case there are any copycats. Eric Noonan, CEO of cybersecurity provider CyberSheath, said that ransomware attacks typically breach through avenues like a phishing email. These breaches can go undetected for days or even weeks as the hacker moves laterally. The actual deployment of ransomware is often quick and widespread, Noonan said. Most victims find out they\u2019ve been hacked once they lose access to important files or receive digital ransom notes. \u201cRansomware is the digital equivalent of squatters taking over a home. The initial entry goes unnoticed allowing the squatters to occupy and control the property and by the time homeowners notice there is a problem the process for regaining control and ownership is disruptive and expensive,\u201d Noonan said. While companies used less interconnected systems in the past, the move to the cloud and reliance on third-party systems \u2014 despite helping daily business operations \u2014 creates complex systems that are more susceptible to widespread hacks. \u201cIt also creates kind of a bullseye and it helps attackers focus their efforts on specific types of infrastructure or specific cloud platforms,\u201d Noonan said. And hackers are targeting organizations that serve in the supply chain of industries. By attacking CDK\u2019s software, for instance, hackers were able to bring the vehicle dealership industry to a standstill. Change and Ascension, large hospital chains, were not able to provide adequate care to their many branches. That gives hackers leverage to ask for larger and larger sums of money, said John Dwyer, director of security research at Binary Defense, a cybersecurity solutions firm. Though hackers have more leverage, the success of paying a ransom and a speedy recovery is elusive, experts said. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a story written on a company that successfully paid a ransom, and then quickly recovered their systems,\u201d Noonan said. Healthcare is an easy target Noonan said the issue isn\u2019t that hackers are necessarily getting more advanced, but that many organizations lack modern, up-to-date systems. Most organizations don\u2019t do incident response exercises, which is why it\u2019s taking longer to recover from these massive hacks. \u201cMuch of our critical infrastructure is way behind in terms of being prepared for recognizing cyber threats when they appear, but then more importantly, recovering from them,\u201d Noonan said. An FBI report found that ransomware attackers targeted the healthcare and public health sector the most, followed by critical manufacturing and government facilities. As systems become more interconnected, there is only so much a business can do to upkeep its cybersecurity \u2013 especially when relying on third party systems, like car dealerships do with CDK. \u201cAuto dealerships are not in the business of cybersecurity, so they aren\u2019t really up to the task of protecting that kind of a system. It\u2019s up to the vendor,\u201d Cliff Steinhauer, director of information security and engagement at National Cybersecurity Alliance said. Steinhauer also said it\u2019s a constant game of \u201ccat and mouse.\u201d \u201cEvery time we fix something, the hacker can still break it. And they only have to be right once, we have to be right every single time,\u201d Steinhauer said. Hospital attacks have surged. A nurse who works at Ascension Providence Rochester Hospital near Detroit, Michigan, previously told CNN that the ransomware attack on the networks is \u201cputting patients\u2019 lives in danger,\u201d as healthcare workers have to resort to paper charting with a load of patients to take care of. Others say healthcare is targeted because of the field\u2019s aging technology, Steven McKeon,\u00a0founder and CEO of software companies MacguyverTech and MacNerd, said in a release. This technology helps patients request prescription refills, view test results and schedule appointments, but is also more susceptible to hacks. CNN has reached out to Ascension and Change for comment. How to prevent long shutdowns Dwyer said companies can do a better job of using third-party expertise since many internal security teams are pretty small. The best examples use an internal team that is an expert on the internal systems of the organization and hire third-party cybersecurity providers to bolster their size. Organizations can also put into place systems that can look at security across their business, Liwer said. Others say there should be mandatory minimum cybersecurity requirements for publicly traded companies. Those minimum standards should be viewed like seatbelts and airbags, Noonan said \u2014 they won\u2019t prevent accidents from happening, but will better prepare companies. \u201cThere\u2019s many software companies or critical parts makers or parts of the supply chains that Americans have never heard of \u2013 these companies, the applications and the software or parts that they make until they\u2019re no longer available. There\u2019s many other CDK\u2019s out there,\u201d Noonan said.

{"id": "2024_06_27_media_nfl-verdict-sunday-ticket-antitrust-trial", "text": "A jury ordered the NFL on Thursday to pay more than $4.7 billion for anti-trust violations surrounding its \u201cSunday Ticket\u201d package, which lets fans watch games outside of their home markets but required them to buy access to a bundle of games to do so. Because of the case\u2019s nature as an anti-trust matter, the verdict could be tripled if upheld, putting the NFL on the hook for $14.1 billion in damages. But the league, America\u2019s most popular source of television programming, has already vowed to appeal. The verdict is large enough that if it withstands appeal, it would be a financial blow even to America\u2019s richest, most popular and profitable sport. The NFL\u2019s annual revenue was more than $18 billion last year, according to estimates, and Commissioner Roger Goodell has set an annual revenue target of $25 billion by 2027. Rights fees are the major driver of that revenue stream, but this decision could shake up those deals and others across professional sports, changing the way teams make money. The case, first brought in 2015, focused on the NFL\u2019s package of games outside of a local market that are not shown nationally on other networks. Attorneys for the plaintiffs in the class action suit argued that by restricting broadcasts of those \u201cout-of-market\u201d games to the \u201cSunday Ticket\u201d package, the NFL is forcing customers who just want to watch one team or a small group of teams to pay more. \u201cGiven the relatively low cost of internet streaming and satellite and cable television carriage, each team acting independently would offer their games at a competitive price to anybody in the country who wanted to watch that particular team,\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys argued in a filing. \u201cInstead, however, the teams have all forgone this option in favor of creating a more lucrative monopoly.\u201d Bill Carmody, the lead attorney in the case, told CNN that the Los Angeles jury was out fewer than two hours. \u201cJustice was done, and it was a great day for consumers everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a real decisive win.\u201d During arguments, the plaintiffs had argued that fans of specific teams should be able to buy packages of just the games they want to watch, not the entire league\u2019s worth of out-of-market games. But the jury did not rule on whether that will happen now. It only issued a decision on the amount of damages. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I sure hope so,\u201d Carmody said when asked if individual game or team packages would now be offered. \u201cThat question is something the court is going to deal with separately.\u201d The NFL has argued that it provides the best value for its fans to watch a wide selection of games for free on broadcast networks, and other games without additional charge for those who have cable, satellite or streaming services. \u201cWe are disappointed with the jury\u2019s verdict today in the NFL Sunday Ticket class action lawsuit,\u201d the NFL said in a statement Thursday. \u201cWe continue to believe that our media distribution strategy, which features all NFL games broadcast on free over-the-air television in the markets of the participating teams and national distribution of our most popular games\u2026 is by far the most fan friendly distribution model in all of sports and entertainment.\u00a0We will certainly contest this decision as we believe that the class action claims in this case are baseless and without merit.\u201d The case focused on the package as it had been offered by DirecTV, which had held the exclusive Sunday Ticket package until it lost it to\u00a0Google-owned YouTube TV\u00a0at the start of last season, which the Wall Street Journal reported cost\u00a0$2 billion a year. YouTube charges fans $449 a year for the package.

{"id": "2024_06_28_business_uber-lyft-minimum-wage-massachusetts", "text": "Uber\u00a0Technologies\u00a0and Lyft\u00a0on Thursday agreed to adopt a $32.50 hourly minimum pay standard for Massachusetts drivers and pay $175 million to settle a lawsuit by the state\u2019s attorney general alleging they improperly treated drivers as independent contractors who can legally receive lower compensation than employees. The companies also agreed to give drivers paid sick leave, accident insurance, and healthcare stipends and to stop funding or supporting a ballot initiative that would have asked voters in November to cement app-based drivers\u2019 status as contractors, Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell said. Uber\u00a0and Lyft in separate statements said the agreement reflected the desire of most drivers to work on their own terms while receiving many of the key benefits that are legally guaranteed to employees. \u201cIn taking this opportunity, we\u2019ve resolved historical liabilities by constructing a new operating model that balances both flexibility and benefits,\u201d said Tony West,\u00a0Uber\u2019s chief legal officer. The agreement requires\u00a0Uber\u00a0to pay $148 million and Lyft to pay $27 million to the state. At least $140 million will be paid out to drivers, according to a court filing. Campbell, a Democrat, made the announcement hours after Massachusetts\u2019 top court\u00a0cleared the way\u00a0for voters to decide whether to approve the industry-backed ballot measure, along with a\u00a0dueling labor-backed proposal\u00a0to allow drivers to unionize that will continue to move forward. It was also the eve of closing arguments in a\u00a0non-jury trial\u00a0in a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0filed in 2020 by Campbell\u2019s predecessor, now-Governor Maura Healey, over the status of drivers whose services have helped fuel the U.S. gig worker economy. Campbell had been asking a judge to conclude that the state\u2019s 55,000\u00a0Uber\u00a0drivers and 35,000 Lyft drivers are employees under state law and therefore entitled to benefits such as a minimum wage, overtime and earned sick time. Studies have shown that using contractors can cost companies as much as 30% less than employees. \u201cFor years, these companies have underpaid their drivers and denied them basic benefits,\u201d Cambpell said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s agreement holds\u00a0Uber\u00a0and Lyft accountable.\u201d The settlement provides for greater benefits and pay for\u00a0Uber\u00a0and Lyft drivers than provided under a similar settlement\u00a0in November with New York state\u00a0and under legislation signed into law in May in Minnesota. Uber\u00a0and Lyft in defending themselves at trial had argued that Campbell\u2019s office misunderstood their business models and that they could be forced to cut or end service in Massachusetts if their drivers were deemed employees. They along with DoorDash\u00a0and Instacart had financially supported Flexibility and Benefits for Massachusetts Drivers, the ballot measure committee behind the proposal to ask voters to deem app-based drivers as contractors. The proposal had also called for providing drivers benefits similar to those in the settlement. After its announcement, Conor Yunits, a spokesperson for the industry-backed campaign, said the group will no longer be moving forward with the initiative. The industry through a $200 million campaign\u00a0had previously in\u00a02020 convinced California voters to pass a measure similar to the one backed by the companies in Massachusetts, solidifying drivers as independent contractors with some benefits.\u00a0Litigation challenging\u00a0that measure is ongoing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/business/uber-lyft-minimum-wage-massachusetts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_25_economy_fed-officials-talking-down-rate-cut", "text": "At the beginning of the year, Federal Reserve officials projected they would cut interest rates three times this year. By June, they had lowered that projection to just one cut. Now some key policymakers say it won\u2019t happen at all. On Tuesday morning, Fed governor Michelle Bowman said that she\u2019s expecting no rate cuts this year. \u201cInflation in the US remains elevated and I still see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook,\u201d Bowman said at an event hosted by the Policy Exchange think tank in London. Supply chains have largely normalized, she said. The labor-force participation rate has leveled off after a post-Covid boom, and the US immigration policy rate may soon become more restrictive, limiting potential new labor market participants. None of these factors leave her confident that inflation rates will ease in the coming months. Bowman, who is a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, also hinted that interest rates could go higher if inflation accelerates. \u201cI remain willing to raise the target range for the federal-funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse,\u201d she said. \u201cReducing our policy rate too soon or too quickly could result in a rebound in inflation, requiring further future policy rate increases to return inflation to 2% over the longer run.\u201d Investors weren\u2019t happy to hear it. The Dow fell nearly 400 points Tuesday. (The broader S&P 500 was slightly higher, boosted by a comeback in Nvidia.)

Also a voting member this year, said on Monday the Fed must be agile and \u201cif inflation falls more slowly than expected, the policy rate must stay higher for longer.\u201d Speaking at the Commonwealth Club World Affairs of California in San Francisco, Daly said the economy remained strong and that she would not consider preemptively lowering interest rates before inflation comes down. \u201cI do think that preemptive cutting is something that you do when you see risks,\u201d Daly said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be resolute until we finish the job. That\u2019s why not taking preemptive action when it\u2019s not necessary is so important.\u201d Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee has also been particularly hawkish in his views. Goolsbee said on Monday that he would need to see \u201cmore months\u2019 of strong inflation data to even begin to consider cutting rates. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who is not voting this year, has floated the possibility of not cutting rates at all this year multiple times over the past few months. He also said rate hikes are \u201ccertainly not off the table.\u201d Like Bowman and Kashkari, New York Fed President John Williams said rate hikes aren\u2019t part of his baseline outlook. But he said he\u2019s not even remotely considering a rate increase at the moment. Policymakers forecast earlier this month that inflation will be more stubborn this year than they had previously thought and held interest rates at a 23-year high, where they have sat for nearly a year. The latest read on inflation will come Friday when the Commerce Department releases the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index data for May. The PCE index, which measured 2.7% in April, is the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/economy/fed-officials-talking-down-rate-cut/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_28_business_cdk-massive-car-dealership-outage", "text": "CDK Global is still down heading into the brisk car-selling Fourth of July holiday next week. Auto dealerships use its software to manage everything from scheduling to records, and the mass outage since last week has paralyzed nearly 15,000 dealerships across North America. CDK said last Saturday that it has begun restoring its software, but both car buyers and dealers are currently at a standstill. It has suggested several times that a fix is in order, only to say then that its systems would remain out of commission for a while longer. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the massive software outage. What does CDK Global do? CDK Global provides data and technology to different automotive dealerships. Its systems are used by roughly 15,000 car dealerships across the United States and Canada. CDK operates different software products car dealers use to handle workflow such as keeping records of negotiated deals, to scheduling and communicating about service. Not every dealer uses CDK\u2019s products, and those that do may not use CDK for every dealership task, but the system shutdown has been a problem for many. To protect customer privacy, customers\u2019 details aren\u2019t written out on a piece of paper that\u2019s just sitting on a desk anymore. Instead, information about deals and customer appointments is\u00a0kept in a server that\u2019s now impossible for salespeople affected by the outage to access. Can I still buy a car or get my car repaired? Salespeople and service employees who spoke with CNN say they\u2019ve resorted to using pen and paper to process purchases, which has drawn out the amount of time it takes to buy a car, according to Scott Campbell, a salesman at Capital City Buick GMC in Berlin, Vermont. He estimates wait times have doubled or tripled. Several buyers and repair customers tell CNN they\u2019ve experienced long delays. Don Aycock told CNN he drove 90 miles round-trip from his home to a car dealership in Clay County, Florida, to buy a new Buick on Thursday, a day after the CDK shutdown. He told CNN he was able to buy the car but was unable to sign the title. \u201cWe got a call from them today that we can come next Thursday to sign the paperwork for the title and get a permanent license plate,\u201d he said, noting that it will be another lengthy round-trip drive. In San Diego \u2014 where temperatures in recent days have been pushing 90 degrees \u2014 Robbie Jacob and his wife tried to make an appointment at a Kia service center to fix their car\u2019s broken air conditioning unit. Jacob said the center told them it was unable to service the car, citing the CDK cyber incident, as there were no appointments available and all walk-ins were suspended until next week. Can I still register my car? Midway Automotive uses a CDK product to register cars with the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles. Owner Michael Deveney says that after the shutdown on Wednesday, the dealership started sending customers to their local RMV office in order to register their cars in person after purchase. \u201cThat was up until Thursday. Then customers started being told that (the RMV) wasn\u2019t taking any walk-ins,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were probably getting flooded with customers and started turning people away.\u201d Some 30 miles north in Lynn, Massachusetts, Katelyn Salvato says she hasn\u2019t been able to register a vehicle since last Tuesday. Salvato works as a title clerk for Pride Motor Group, registering cars for three dealerships. \u201cToday\u2026 I sent 21 registrations to be done manually at the Massachusetts RMV,\u201d she said. Callahan echoed those concerns. Under normal circumstances, the CDK software allows the dealership to register a vehicle almost instantaneously, but now the process faces heavy delays. \u201cOur remote registration system is rendered useless without CDK to talk to it. We\u2019ve had to send a runner with the registrations to the DMV to be competed in packs, costing several days where prior it took hours,\u201d Callahan said in an interview with CNN. When will CDK be back online? CDK Global doesn\u2019t believe its systems will return online before June 30. In an automated voice message to clients, CDK said it is making \u201csignificant progress\u201d in restoring its core application. \u201cWe do feel it\u2019s important to share that we do not believe that we will be able to get all dealers live prior to June 30,\u201d the message said. The company also urged dealerships to make alternate plans for their month-end financial reports. However, CDK gave dealerships encouraging news on Wednesday. It said it was able to bring a \u201csmall initial test group\u201d of car dealerships back online. The company also said it\u2019s also working to bring additional applications back online, such as its customer relationship management and service solutions, as well as its customer care channels. Problems began last Wednesday when CDK spokesperson Lisa Finney told CNN that the company was\u00a0investigating a cyber incident. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution and concern for our customers, we have shut down most of our systems and are working diligently to get everything up and running as quickly as possible,\u201d Finney said in the statement. Later that day, the company said most of its critical computer systems were back online. But the next morning, the company told dealerships another incident had happened. Why did systems go down? CDK has said it is working to investigate the shutdown after two cyber incidents brought its systems to a standstill. The company has not confirmed who was behind the incidents. Bloomberg\u00a0previously reported\u00a0the company was negotiating with an Eastern Europe-based hacker group demanding tens of millions of dollars in ransom to end the outage. CDK has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment about the reported ransom. Why is this hack so impactful? While companies used fewer interconnected workflow systems in the past, the move to cloud computing and reliance on third-party software systems \u2014 despite helping daily business operations \u2014 creates complex systems that are more susceptible to widespread hacks. If the main part of the centralized system goes down, it means that everything goes down. Rather than having to hack each dealership individually, all hackers have to do is hack where all the data is stored for all of them. \u201cIt also creates kind of a bullseye and it helps attackers focus their efforts on specific types of infrastructure or specific cloud platforms,\u201d Eric Noonan, CEO of cybersecurity provider CyberSheath, said. And hackers are targeting organizations that serve in the supply chain of industries. By attacking CDK\u2019s software, for instance, hackers were able to bring the vehicle dealership industry to a standstill. That gives hackers leverage to ask for larger and larger sums of money, said John Dwyer, director of security research at Binary Defense, a cybersecurity solutions firm. Though hackers have more leverage, the success of paying a ransom and a speedy recovery is elusive, experts said. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a story written on a company that successfully paid a ransom, and then quickly recovered their systems,\u201d Noonan said. What is the financial impact on dealerships? At a Mazda dealership in Seekonk, Massachusetts, general sales manager Ryan Callahan said the outage has affected nearly every aspect of its business. \u201cThe financial impact it will directly have on us will take months to correct, if not years,\u201d Callahan said. Tom McParland, the owner of Automatch Consulting, a national car buying service, said the outage was impacting customers because they now have fewer dealers to choose from. \u201cIt reduces their ability to get a deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt limits the customer\u2019s leverage.\u201d Some dealers also can\u2019t apply factory rebates without CDK\u2019s software, so customers may miss out on money-saving deals. For customers looking to buy a car, McParland suggested casting a wide net and shopping outside their local market to find the best price.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/business/cdk-massive-car-dealership-outage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/29/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_business_federal-judge-denies-30-billion-settlement-visa-mastercard", "text": "A federal judge overseeing a $30 billion preliminary swipe-fees settlement between Mastercard, Visa and retailers formally rejected the deal Tuesday. The ruling likely means the credit card processors will have to make more concessions to resolve their long-standing dispute with merchants. Mastercard and Visa, two of the world\u2019s largest credit card networks, reached their proposed multi-billion antitrust settlement with US merchants in March. The settlement would lower swipe fees, or interchange fees, that a retailer must pay when a customer makes a purchase using their card. The details of Tuesday\u2019s ruling made by Judge Margo Brodie of the US District Court of the Eastern District of New York have not been made public. But a memo released by the court on Tuesday said that she was \u201cnot likely to grant final approval\u201d to the preliminary settlement absent any changes. Retailers typically are charged 2% of the total customer transaction in swipe fees \u2014\u202fbut they can be as much as 4% for some premium rewards cards, according to industry estimates. The proposed settlement would have lowered those fees by at least 0.04% percentage points for a minimum of three years. What the preliminary settlement entailed The proposed settlement, which hinged on final approval from the Eastern District of New York, resulted from a longstanding antitrust class-action lawsuit in 2005. In the suit, merchants alleged that the card companies and the banks that issue cards with them colluded to charge businesses inflated swipe fees and prevented them from directing their customers to other, cheaper payment options. Under the preliminary settlement, the card companies denied any wrongdoing and agreed to maintain the swipe fee rates that existed as of December 31, 2023, for a period of five years. Visa and Mastercard also agreed to remove anti-competitive restrictions so that merchants could suggest other preferred card options to customers going forward. For one thing, the proposed settlement gave merchants the ability to impose surcharges on customers depending on what kind of Visa or Mastercard card they use. Those surcharges would likely hit cardholders who get rewards such as cash back and airline miles, since those can carry higher swipe fees. Big retailers at odds with small businesses Over 90% of the merchants who agreed to the preliminary settlement with Visa and Mastercard were small businesses, according to Visa. Still, the National Federation of Independent Business viewed it as \u201ctemporary relief\u201d for small businesses and not a long-term solution, Jeff Brabant, vice president of federal government relations at NFIB, told CNN in a statement. Trade groups representing big retailers have been even more outspoken critics. The Merchants Payments Coalition (MPC) \u2014 whose members include supermarkets, retail chains, restaurants, drug stores, convenience stores, gas stations and online merchants focused on payments system reform \u2014 blasted the preliminary settlement as being insufficient. Christopher Jones, an executive committee member of the Merchants Payments Coalition, said it would have enabled the credit card companies to \u201ckeep price-fixing swipe fees and blocking competition.\u201d \u201cThankfully, the judge made the right call in recognizing what a bad deal this would have been for Main Street merchants and their customers,\u201d Jones said in a statement on Tuesday. The Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade group representing a slew of large retailers including Target, CVS, Dollar General, similarly applauded Tuesday\u2019s ruling. \u201cLeading retailers are grateful that Judge Brodie saw through the fa\u00e7ade of the proposed settlement and understood that it would not provide the meaningful change that is needed to correct the competitive imbalance in the interchange ecosystem,\u201d RILA said in a statement. A Mastercard spokesperson told CNN in an emailed statement they were \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the ruling. \u201cWe believe the settlement presented a fair resolution of this long-standing dispute, most notably by giving business owners more flexibility in how they manage their card acceptance activities. We will pursue our options to ensure a proper resolution of this matter.\u201d Visa did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for a comment. Glenn Licht, owner of Pescatore Seafood Company in New York, had been anxiously awaiting the final ruling on the settlement. Licht\u2019s business operates two seafood stores in New York City\u2019s iconic Grand Central Terminal market. One sells prepared seafood for takeaway, and the other is a grab-and-go sushi store. Pre-Covid, Licht said the businesses were 80% cash and 20% credit card payments. \u201cThat\u2019s totally flipped. Now it\u2019s a minimum of 80% credit cards and the rest is cash,\u201d he said. That means with his significant exposure to swipe fees, those extra charges can add up and can affect profitability. \u201cAs a small retailer, you feel the effects of that,\u201d he said. And separate to his two seafood shops, the company also has an online seafood business. \u201cWe also ship seafood nationwide. However, that business is 100% credit cards,\u201d Licht said. Licht said he never believed that the $30 billion settlement would \u201ctrickle down\u201d to him as a small merchant in a way that \u201cwould have been a gamechanger.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think the ruling will move the needle much on our financial statement,\u201d he said.
