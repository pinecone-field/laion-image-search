But unlike other speakers at the RNC, O\u2019Brien\u2019s appearance does not represent an endorsement of Trump, according to Teamsters union spokesperson Kara Deniz. O\u2019Brien has requested the opportunity to also speak at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August. The DNC has yet to accept that request, Deniz said. Trump posted the announcement Friday afternoon on his Truth Social platform. \u201cOur GREAT convention will unify Americans and demonstrate to the nation\u2019s working families they come first,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWhen I am back in the White House, the hardworking Teamsters, and all working Americans, will once again have a country they can afford to live in and be respected around the world. Sean, I look forward to seeing you represent the Teamsters in Milwaukee. Together we can Make America Great Again.\u201d Deniz said in an email that the union was happy Trump extended the invitation. \u201cThis is truly unprecedented since it will be the very first time a Teamsters General President has addressed the RNC,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cOur 1.3 million members\u00a0represent every political background, and their message needs to be heard by as wide an audience as possible, and that includes all political candidates running for elected office. We appreciate former President Trump\u2019s openness to inviting a labor leader to speak on behalf of working families.\u201d \u201cWe sincerely hope the DNC will also respond to our request with an invitation,\u201d she said. Trump and O\u2019Brien met at the former president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in early January. Trump then met with the union\u2019s leadership on January 31. Some other union leaders objected to the meetings, with John Palmer \u2014 the group\u2019s international vice president at-large \u2014 writing a letter at that time denouncing Trump as \u201ca known union buster, scab, and insurrectionist.\u201d \u201cWe should never entertain dialogue with a candidate with such an anti-union record,\u201d he wrote. Biden has a very pro-union record. He became the first sitting president to appear on the picket line to support strikers during the United Auto Workers union\u2019s strike against the nation\u2019s three unionized automakers. He has regularly voiced support for unions and has appointed a very pro-union leadership to the National Labor Relations Board, which has been much friendlier to union positions during his administration. He also met with the Teamsters leadership in March. But so far, the Teamsters have endorsed neither candidate, unlike the AFL-CIO and many powerful unions, such as the UAW and the National Education Association. And the union\u2019s political arm gave similar size donations of hundreds of thousands of dollars to committees of both the Democratic and Republican parties earlier this year. O\u2019Brien has had his own harsh criticism of some other Republicans, if not Trump. At a Senate hearing in November, he and Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican from Oklahoma, both said they were prepared to engage in a fist fight in the middle of a hearing until Sen. Bernie Sanders, the committee chair, ordered them to stop. The DNC said it has yet to settle on its set of speakers for its convention in August. \u201cWe are building a convention in Chicago that will tell our story to the American people, including the stories of labor and union leaders and workers that President Biden has been delivering\u00a0for as the most pro-union president in modern history,\u201d said DNC spokesperson Matt Hill. \u2013 CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg and Kristen Holmes contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/business/teamsters-president-speaking-republican-convention-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_media_jeff-bezos-will-lewis-washington-post", "text": "Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of The Washington Post, broke his silence Tuesday on the mounting turmoil within his newspaper, expressing support for maintaining high standards at the storied publication as questions swirl over the ethical integrity of its new publisher, Will Lewis. \u201cI know you\u2019ve already heard this from Will, but I wanted to also weigh in directly: the journalistic standards and ethics at The Post will not change,\u201d Bezos said in an email to top newsroom leaders, signaling support for Lewis, though not explicitly. Bezos added in the memo, which was obtained by CNN, that \u201cit can\u2019t be business as usual\u201d at The Post, which has been plagued by financial and audience woes. \u201cThe world is evolving rapidly and we do need to change as a business. With your support, we\u2019ll do that and lead this great institution into the future,\u201d Bezos wrote. \u201cBut, as the newsroom leaders who\u2019ve been shaping and guiding our coverage, you also know our standards at The Post have always been very high. That can\u2019t change \u2014 and it won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cYou have my full commitment on maintaining the quality, ethics, and standards we all believe in,\u201d Bezos added. The memo to The Post\u2019s top personnel comes after serious questions were raised about Lewis, who has been the subject of several explosive reports in recent days that raise questions over whether he is committed to the newspaper\u2019s rigorous journalistic standards. The New York Times\u00a0reported over the weekend\u00a0that, in his Fleet Street days, Lewis assigned an article that was based on stolen phone records. And The Post itself reported in a 3,000-word\u00a0front page story\u00a0Sunday that a \u201cthief\u201d who used deceptive tactics to obtain private material had ties with Lewis\u2019 hand-picked incoming top editor, Robert Winnett. The stories, which landed like a one-two punch in The Post\u2019s newsroom, followed reports that Lewis tried to suppress stories at The Post and NPR about his role cleaning up Rupert Murdoch\u2019s UK phone hacking scandal, when he served as a lieutenant to the right-wing media mogul. Instead of deescalating the situation, Lewis initially lashed out, going so far as to criticize his own media reporters and launch an on-the-record attack aimed at the well-respected NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik, who he referred to as an \u201cactivist, not a journalist.\u201d Lewis later sent a memo to staffers, striking a notably different, non-confrontational tone. But the note did not quell the growing anger within The Post. Inside The Post\u2019s newsroom, morale has plunged in recent months as alarmed staffers express frustration over Lewis\u2019 conduct and worries over the future direction of the newspaper under his leadership. Interviews with nearly a dozen Post staffers and others familiar with the internal dynamics of the newspaper this week revealed a workforce that has grown increasingly dismayed by the situation, with some searching for work elsewhere. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the professor and senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, told CNN on Monday that Bezos should dismiss Lewis. Sonnenfeld, who has advised US presidents and scores of corporate leaders, said that if he were advising Bezos, he would tell him Lewis has \u201clost legitimacy to lead\u201d and it\u2019s time to \u201cclean the house.\u201d \u201cThis is a tragic meltdown of the conscience of American journalism bringing shame to the Katharine Graham, Ben Bradlee, Marty Baron legacy of collaboration, courage, and integrity,\u201d Sonnenfeld said. \u201cBezos must recruit an accomplished, experienced editor whom journalists admire and trust.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/media/jeff-bezos-will-lewis-washington-post/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_food_subway-dippers-sidekick-expansion", "text": "Subway\u2019s footlong cookies were so popular they had a shortage. Now, the chain is hoping to replicate that success with savory new companions. Beginning Tuesday, three new 12-inch long additions are arriving, called Dippers. They use Subway\u2019s flatbread, rolled up with pepperoni and cheese, chicken and cheese or double cheese, and served hot. The $3 rollups are part of its Sidekicks menu, adding to its successful lineup of giant cookies, churros and soft pretzels. Value is a major factor in the expansion of Sidekicks. Many fast food chains are releasing new menu items and discounts to lure back cash-strapped consumers, especially\u00a0low-income consumers who are dining out less often and\u00a0spending less when they do. Sidekicks and Dippers were born out of the chain seeing younger customers\u2019 preference for snacking, according to Douglas\u00a0Fry, Subway\u2019s North America president, who said they want \u201cconvenient, hand-held, grab-and-go\u201d food at an affordable price. \u201cWe know that the economic climate has started to shift,\u201d Fry told CNN. He observed that customers have \u201cbeen sacrificing quantity and quality,\u201d and that Subway offers a \u201cgreat value proposition of great-tasting food that\u2019s made fresh and is available for a variety of budgets.\u201d Dippers are a cost-efficient addition for Subway, using existing ingredients like flatbread from its recently unveiled wraps lineup and the meats and cheeses already used in its sandwiches. Subway\u2019s\u00a0new Sidekicks lineup is a key part of its turnaround plans, which includes a number of other changes to its menus as part of its efforts to keep up with rivals. Since the January launch, Fry said the chain has sold more than 30 million snacks, priced from $2 to $5, and \u201cprobably would have sold more\u201d if it wasn\u2019t for the cookie shortage. The addition of Sidekicks \u201cmakes sense,\u201d said David Henkes, senior principal at Technomic, previously telling CNN that Subway needs to increase revenue somewhere since fast food customers have begun pushing back on price increases amid overall inflation. \u201cThey\u2019ve underperformed in\u00a0the sandwich\u00a0segment, so they need to shake things up a little bit and drive some incremental traffic,\u201d Henkes said. Technomic data shows that Subway also lags in sales for sides and snacks compared to its competitors. In recent years, Subway has added\u00a0customization to its menu, doubled down on pushing orders to its app, increased its\u00a0international presence\u00a0and introduced\u00a0freshly sliced meats\u00a0\u2014 a major shift from Subway\u2019s previous method of delivering cold cuts pre-sliced. Another major hurdle for Subway is it its dwindling store count: The chain closed more than 400 restaurants in the US in 2023, finishing the year with its smallest number of US restaurants (20,133) since 2005. Owned by Roark Capital, a privately held company, Subway doesn\u2019t regularly release financial figures. The private equity firm holds investments in a number of large restaurant chains, including Arby\u2019s, Auntie Anne\u2019s, Buffalo Wild Wings and Sonic.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/food/subway-dippers-sidekick-expansion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

Its products handle everything from records to scheduling. Now, thousands of dealerships across the United States and Canada are entering a third day in a near deadlock after two consecutive cyber incidents at CDK Global led to a shut down of its systems. There\u2019s never an opportune time for a systems outage, but it\u2019s now the official start of summer, a time when many Americans are shopping for a new car and dealerships enjoy a bump in sales. Here\u2019s what the CDK Global outage means for both car sellers and shoppers. What exactly happened? On Wednesday, CDK spokesperson Lisa Finney told CNN that the company was investigating a cyber incident. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution and concern for our customers, we have shut down most of our systems and are working diligently to get everything up and running as quickly as possible,\u201d Finney said in the statement. Later Wednesday, the company said most of its critical computer systems were back online. But Thursday morning, the company told dealerships another incident had happened. North Carolina-based Sonic Automotive said it was a \u201ccybersecurity incident.\u201d CNN has asked CDK to confirm. Are systems still shut down? CDK said it proactively shut down most of its systems after it experienced an additional cyber incident late in the evening on Wednesday, June 19. \u201cIn partnership with third party experts, we are assessing the impact and providing regular updates to our customers. We remain vigilant in our efforts to reinstate our services and get our dealers back to business as usual as quickly as possible,\u201d the company said in a statement Thursday. On Thursday afternoon, the company said it still had no new information. The company told dealers the systems could be down for several days, according to two sources briefed on the situation. What does CDK Global do? CDK Global provides data and technology to different automotive dealerships. Its systems are used by roughly 15,000 car dealerships across the United States and Canada. CDK operates different products that car dealers use to handle things like keeping records of negotiated deals to scheduling and communicating about service. Not every dealer uses CDK\u2019s products, and even those that do may not use them for everything, but the system shutdown has been a problem for many. To protect customer privacy, customers\u2019 details aren\u2019t written out on a piece of paper that\u2019s just sitting on a desk anymore. Instead, information about deals and customer appointments is\u00a0kept in a server that\u2019s now impossible for salespeople affected by the outage to access. Why is this a bad time for dealerships? The outage can eat into sales during the first official weekend of the summer. Summer is car-buying season. CDK said it themselves in a blog post on its site last week. Post Memorial Day, \u201cthis presents increased opportunities for vehicle sales, service and, of course, revenue. It also means that it\u2019s time to roll out your summer Sales and Service marketing campaigns.\u201d In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Sonic Automotive said the outage resulted in disruptions to its dealer management system hosted by CDK, \u201cwhich supports critical dealership operations including those supporting sales, inventory and accounting functions and its customer relationship management system.\u201d The company said that while the outage has affected its business operations, it hasn\u2019t determined the financial impact. Can I still buy a car? Jeff Ramsey, an executive with Ourisman Auto Group, which is headquartered in Maryland, told CNN the shutdown is a major hassle and could cost his dealerships some business. Customers who are delayed in closing a sale at one of his dealerships could just find a dealer nearby that\u2019s not having these issues and buy a new vehicle there, instead. However, some affected dealerships are still selling cars. \u201cMy selling team can hand-write a buyer\u2019s order,\u201d said Brian Benstock, general manager of Paragon Honda and Paragon Acura in Long Island City, New York. But salespeople could lack access to customer agreements that had been previously negotiated, making it harder to close those sales, dealers CNN spoke with said. There\u2019s more than just the negotiated price of the car involved, since these agreements can involve rebates and incentives, some of which customers must show they\u2019re qualified for. What are automakers saying? Ramsey, whose company operates a number of dealerships, said automakers including Kia, Toyota and Stellantis, which makes Jeep and Dodge vehicles, have been very helpful with finding ways to serve customers even with all technology issues. Ford also said its dealerships involved in the CDK outage have alternate ways to take care of customers. \u201cAlthough there is an industry-wide system outage for some dealers who use CDK, Ford and Lincoln customers are able to receive sales and service support due to alternative processes available to our dealers. While a customer\u2019s local dealer remains the best place for information about their sales and service needs, they can always contact the Ford Customer Relationship Center at 1-800-392-3673,\u201d Ford said in a statement shared with CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/business/cdk-global-car-dealership-outage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_business_boeing-whistleblower-calhoun-testimony", "text": "A current Boeing employee claims that the company tried to shield broken or out-of-specification 737 Max plane parts from regulators and lost track of them, according to a Senate subcommittee investigation made public Tuesday. Boeing tried to hide the nonconforming parts from Federal Aviation Administration regulators by moving them out of sight and falsifying records, claims Sam Mohawk, the new whistleblower who works for Boeing quality assurance unit in Renton, Washington. Boeing was unable to account for many of the parts that it moved around to skirt regulators, and they probably ended up getting installed in some planes, Mohawk said. Boeing said it received the report from Congressional investigators Monday evening. \u201cWe are reviewing the claims,\u201d said the company\u2019s statement. \u201cWe continuously encourage employees to report all concerns as our priority is to ensure the safety of our airplanes and the flying public.\u201d Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun will be confronted with the new claims in addition to other whistleblower charges about Boeing\u2019s safety lapses at his first-ever congressional hearing Tuesday. The outgoing Boeing CEO plans to apologize for Boeing\u2019s recent safety failures in his testimony. According to his prepared testimony shared with CNN, Calhoun will admit to problems with the company\u2019s culture, but he\u2019ll push back on claims that the company retaliated against those who brought safety issues to light. \u201cMuch has been said about Boeing\u2019s culture. We\u2019ve heard those concerns loud and clear,\u201d he will say in prepared remarks released by Boeing Monday afternoon. \u201cOur culture is far from perfect, but we are taking action and making progress. We understand the gravity, and we are committed to moving forward.\u201d The \u201cfar from perfect\u201d remark is a massive understatement. Boeing has been under intense scrutiny with numerous federal investigations and congressional hearings since a January 5 Alaska Air Boeing 737 Max flight had a door plug blow off, leaving a gaping hole in both the plane and Boeing\u2019s reputation. Beyond the bad publicity of the Senate hearing, Boeing has been ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration to improve its safety issues before it can resume normal production, causing problems for airlines that can\u2019t get the planes they ordered. And that, in turn, has meant higher fares for passengers, who have had their faith the company\u2019s planes sorely tested. Prioritizing profits over safety In prepared remarks released early Tuesday from Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat who chairs the committee, the senator accuses Calhoun of putting profits of airplane safety, of leading a company where those raising safety concerns regularly faced retaliation, despite the claims otherwise from management. \u201cThis is a culture that continues to prioritize profits, push limits, and disregard its workers,\u201d said the prepared opening remarks released by Blumenthal.\u00a0\u201cA culture where those who speak up are silenced and sidelined while blame is pushed down to the factory floor.\u00a0A culture that enables retaliation against those who do not submit to the bottom line.\u00a0A culture that desperately needs to be repaired.\u201d Blumenthal told CNN Tuesday that his committee has heard from a dozen whistleblowers at Boeing, including Mohawk. \u201cHis allegations are extraordinarily serious,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cHis account of the retaliation against him is particularly chilling the pressure that was exerted on him to stay silent. They have a program called Speak up well, he was told to shut up.\u201d Blumenthal said he and others had hoped that Calhoun would change the culture and practices at Boeing for the better when he was took over as CEO in January 2020, 10 months into a 20-month grounding of the 737 Max that followed two fatal crashes. \u201cBut then, this past January, the fa\u00e7ade quite literally blew off the hollow shell that had been Boeing\u2019s promises to the world,\u201d Blumenthal will say, according to his prepared testimony, a reference to the door plug blowout.\u00a0\u201cAnd once that chasm was exposed, we learned that there was virtually no bottom to the void that lay below.\u201d An extensive research document prepared by committee aides show the panel is armed with whistleblower accounts from inside Boeing.\u00a0Some of the whistleblowers in the document have shared their accounts publicly or with CNN. Among them is Mohawk\u2019s claim that in June 2023, when the FAA notified Boeing that it would inspect its Renton plant, the company told employees to move the majority of the 60 nonconforming parts to another location to hide them from inspectors. Many of them were moved back, but some were lost, Mohawk alleges. He also claims Boeing in August 2023 told employees to delete records about nonconforming parts, which led him to complain \u2013 but Boeing took no action. Aides wrote in a memo that the whistleblowers\u00a0\u201cpaint a troubling picture of a company that prioritizes speed of manufacturing and cutting costs over ensuring the quality and safety of aircraft.\u201d \u201cThese misplaced priorities appear to contribute to a safety culture that insufficiently values and addresses the root causes of employee concerns and insufficiently deters retaliation against employees that speak up,\u201d the memo reads. The hearing Tuesday by the Senate\u2019s permanent subcommittee on investigations is entitled \u201cBoeing\u2019s broken safety culture.\u201d It is just the latest congressional hearing this year about safety issues at Boeing but the first time Calhoun is testifying in his more than four years running the troubled company. He will be joined by Howard McKenzie, Boeing\u2019s chief engineer. At an April 17 hearing Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour testified that Boeing is putting out defective planes because he and others who complain faced pressure not to do so. \u201cI have serious concerns about the safety of the 787 and 777 aircraft, and I\u2019m willing to take on professional risk to talk about them,\u201d Salehpour said in his opening statement. He said when he raised concerns, \u201cI was ignored. I was told not to create delays. I was told, frankly, to shut up.\u201d Calhoun\u2019s prepared remarks deny the claims of the whistleblowers and Blumenthal about retaliation against those who raise safety concerns. \u201cWe are committed to making sure every employee feels empowered to speak up if there is a problem,\u201d he\u2019ll say, according to the prepared remarks. \u201cWe also have strict policies in place to prohibit retaliation against employees who come forward. It is our job to listen, regardless of how we obtain feedback, and handle it with the seriousness it deserves.\u201d Will there be changes? Despite the attention the hearing is expected to garner, it\u2019s unlikely to produce significant change at the company, said Richard Aboulafia, managing partner for AeroDynamic Consultancy, an aerospace advisory firm. \u201cNothing has produced change (at Boeing) except frustration from a bunch of airline customers,\u201d said Aboulafia. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what will change as a consequence of this. He (Calhoun) needs to go. He has shown a strong desire to double down on what\u2019s bad.\u201d A preliminary investigation of the Alaska Air incident has found that the plane left a Boeing factory two months before the incident without the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place. And Boeing has yet to produce the paperwork to identify who in the factory installed the door plug without the bolts. It has been harshly criticized by members of Congress and safety regulators and will likely face more criticism Tuesday. Calhoun has already met with members of Congress since the Alaska Air incident, albeit behind closed doors. He has also made numerous public statements to Boeing employees and to investors since the Alaska Air incident. \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that,\u201d he told investors in January during a call after reporting its fifth straight annual loss. \u201cWhatever conclusions (from the investigations) are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better.\u201d Apologies to families, passengers Calhoun\u2019s prepared remarks begin with an apology to the family members of the victims of two fatal 737 Max crashes. Some of those family members plan to attend the hearing. Between them, 346 people were killed in the 2018 and 2019 crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, leading to to a 20-month grounding of the jet to fix a design flaw that caused the crashes. \u201cWe are deeply sorry for your losses,\u201d he\u2019ll say in his opening comments. \u201cNothing is more important than the safety of the people who step on board our airplanes. Every day we seek to honor the memory of those lost.\u201d He also plans to again apologize to the passengers and crew of the Alaska Air flight in January. \u201cWe deeply regret the impact that the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 accident had on Alaska Airlines\u2019 team and its passengers, and we are grateful to the pilots and crew for safely landing the plane,\u201d he\u2019ll say. \u201cWe are thankful that there were no fatalities.\u201d But experts say that it was sheer luck that no one was killed in the Alaska Air incident. This could very well be Calhoun\u2019s only time testifying on Capitol Hill. He has announced plans to retire before the end of this year. His successor has yet to be selected. Beyond Tuesday\u2019s hearing, and the numerous federal investigations it faces, the company could still face criminal liability from the original certification process of the 737 Max. In January of 2021 Boeing agreed to a probationary period, which deferred any prosecution on those charges and which would have exempted it from criminal liability in the crashes. But the January 5 incident aboard the Alaska Air flight happened just days before the end of the probationary period. In May the Justice Department notified Boeing that it was now subject to criminal prosecution. Boeing has denied the Alaska Air incident violated the deferred prosecution agreement and is challenging any potential criminal liability in court. The family members planning to attend Tuesday\u2019s hearing say they want to see Boeing prosecuted criminally. Blumenthal told CNN Tuesday that he will reserve judgment on whether Boeing is guilty of criminal misconduct but that \u201cI think there is mounting evidence, perhaps overwhelming evidence now, that prosecution should be pursued.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/business/boeing-whistleblower-calhoun-testimony/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_media_robert-winnett-washington-post", "text": "The Washington Post said Friday that Robert Winnett, the British journalist who had been slated to take over as the newspaper\u2019s top editor, will no longer join the publication that has been ensnared in a weeks-long crisis over ethics questions. \u201cIt is with regret that I share with you that Robert Winnett has withdrawn from the position of Editor at The Washington Post,\u201d Will Lewis, The Post\u2019s embattled publisher and chief executive, told staff in a Friday morning memo. Winnett, who had been tapped this month by Lewis to join The Post following the November election, will now remain deputy editor of London\u2019s Telegraph newspaper. The decision comes after Winnett\u2019s journalistic integrity was questioned in a 3,000-word front page expose published by The Post, which reported that Winnett had previously used materials from a self-described \u201cthief\u201d for reporting. The news Winnett will no longer join The Post comes as the Jeff Bezos-owned publication remains engulfed in turmoil over serious journalistic ethics questions facing Lewis, the former Rupert Murdoch lieutenant who has been accused of helping the right-wing media mogul cover up for senior executives in a decade-old UK phone hacking scandal. Lewis has denied wrongdoing but recently attempted to suppress stories on the matter, according to private accounts from Sally Buzbee, the former executive editor of The Post, and NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik. The allegations have been revived by a lawsuit from Prince Harry and other high-profile figures, in a case which is scheduled to be adjudicated in court early next year. Amid questions about Lewis\u2019 role in the phone hacking scandal, additional reporting has raised concerns about his journalistic integrity at large. The Guardian published a story this week accusing Lewis of having once advised then-U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson to \u201cclean up\u201d his phone during the so-called \u201cPartygate\u201d scandal. Lewis and Johnson denied the report. Inside The Post\u2019s newsroom, morale has plunged as staffers express alarm over Lewis\u2019 conduct and worries over the future direction of the newspaper under his leadership. Interviews with nearly a dozen Post staffers and others familiar with the internal dynamics of the newspaper this week revealed a workforce that has grown increasingly dismayed by the situation, with some searching for work elsewhere. Patience has also worn thin for owner Bezos, who has yet to address the crisis in a meaningful way. In a short memo to top newsroom leadership Tuesday, Bezos reiterated his commitment to \u201cvery high\u201d standards, but has yet to take any meaningful action to quell his newsroom\u2019s anger. A spokesperson for Bezos did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday when asked if the Amazon billionaire planned to take any additional steps to right the ship. Thus far, Bezos has tepidly signaled that he is supporting his controversy-plagued publisher, whom he installed into the top role at The Post in January. A new search begins Lewis told staffers in his Friday memo that he will \u201cimmediately launch a new search\u201d for a new editor. Lewis said that Matt Murray, the former top editor at The Wall Street Journal who was brought in to take over on an interim basis after Lewis ousted Buzbee, will continue in his role. Lewis\u2019 memo, laying out The Post\u2019s future plans, suggested he will remain at the newspaper, despite concerns from staffers. This week, two Pulitzer Prize-winning Post journalists went on the record, calling for leadership changes at the newspaper. \u201cI don\u2019t know a single person at the Post who thinks the current situation with the publisher and supposed new editor can stand,\u201d David Maraniss, an associate editor who has worked at The Post for nearly five decades and won two Pulitzer Prizes at the newspaper, wrote in a candid Facebook post. \u201cThere might be a few, but very very few.\u201d Maraniss also zinged Bezos, writing that he is \u201cnot of and for the Post or he would understand.\u201d Scott Higham, another Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist at The Post, echoed Maraniss\u2019 call for Lewis to exit the newspaper. \u201cWill Lewis needs to step down for the good of The Post and the public,\u201d Higham replied in a comment on Maraniss\u2019 post. \u201cHe has lost the newsroom and will never win it back.\u201d Independent corporate governance experts have also said Lewis should be shown the door. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the professor and senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, told CNN on Monday that Bezos should dismiss Lewis. Sonnenfeld, who has advised US presidents and scores of corporate leaders, said that if he were advising Bezos, he would tell him Lewis has \u201clost legitimacy to lead\u201d and it\u2019s time to \u201cclean the house.\u201d \u201cThis is a tragic meltdown of the conscience of American journalism bringing shame to the Katharine Graham, Ben Bradlee, Marty Baron legacy of collaboration, courage and integrity,\u201d Sonnenfeld said. \u201cBezos must recruit an accomplished, experienced editor whom journalists admire and trust.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments and context.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/media/robert-winnett-washington-post/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

The company, owned by Europe\u2019s richest man Bernard Arnault, said Thursday that it had bought a majority stake in Chez L\u2019ami Louis, a 100-year-old restaurant in central Paris, described by LVMH as an \u201cauthentic Parisian gem.\u201d \u201cLVMH will work to preserve the unique character and family identity of the restaurant and continue to support its French savoir-faire and expertise,\u201d it said in a press release. It did not disclose the size of its stake nor the value of the deal. The classic bistro \u2014 famed for its roast chicken, mounds of thin, crispy fries, and plates of sizzling snails \u2014 has hosted Bill Clinton and Martin Scorsese, as well as David and Victoria Beckham, according to a source familiar with the deal. The source requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. If that wasn\u2019t endorsement enough, the restaurant has also earned Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s seal of approval. Her lifestyle company Goop describes Chez L\u2019ami Louis on its website as \u201cone of the best, most venerable bistros in Paris.\u201d \u201cIt is small and wood-paneled, with an ancient oven and a sick wine list,\u201d Goop gushed. LVMH said in its press release that the bistro sources its produce from small breeders and market gardeners \u201cwho have been loyal to the restaurant for several generations.\u201d CNN could not reach Chez L\u2019ami Louis for comment Friday. The essence of Paris Arnault has also dined at the Parisian restaurant, the source close to the deal told CNN, adding that the billionaire is passionate about preserving parts of the city\u2019s cultural \u201cidentity and expression.\u201d LVMH and Arnault pledged \u20ac200 million ($226 million) in 2019 to help rebuild Notre Dame after fire devastated the 850-year-old church. The families behind L\u2019Oreal\u00a0(LRLCF) and Kering also made big donations. There is a risk, the source added, that when the historical owners of culturally important venues such as Chez L\u2019ami Louis move on, new investors swoop in and transform them \u201cinto something that is very far from (the original) identity.\u201d Arnault, the world\u2019s third-richest man after Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, is worth an estimated $199 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In recent years, LVMH, which owns Dior and Louis Vuitton among other designer brands, has beefed up its portfolio of hospitality venues. In 2019, the company acquired Belmond, which owns hotels and organizes luxury rail and river cruises, in a $3.2 billion deal. Earlier this month, LVMH announced \u201ca strategic investment\u201d in the Orient Express, a brand offering luxury train travel owned by French hospitality firm Accor.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/business/lvmh-arnault-buys-paris-restaurant/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

The new flavors are available only in the UK and Ireland. The decision has annoyed fans of the show (and of the doughy treats), with social media awash in comments ranging from annoyed to flat-out angry. \u201cFriends\u201d\u00a0was produced by Warner Bros., which shares the same parent company as CNN. The kerfuffle underscores how these kinds of promotional items can bring extra attention and publicity to companies, especially as Krispy Kreme said in a recent earnings call that the doughnut maker is trying to keep its brand fresh for consumers. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly innovating, constantly bringing excitement to the brand, and we\u2019re fresh, fresh daily,\u201d said CEO Josh Charlesworth\u00a0on a first-quarter earnings call in May, according to a transcript made available by FactSet. Special doughnuts \u2014 like the \u201cFriends\u201d flavors now \u2014 helped drive consumers to stores, he said, such as Valentine\u2019s Day or eclipse-themed promotions. But fans had a few words for Krispy Kreme on that score. \u201cThis is where I am just confused by the decision making process,\u201d noted one commenter under an Instagram post by \u201cSnackolator\u201c about the release. \u201cFriends was a huge US show (I know it is big internationally as well, but come on), yet this is a UK thing.\u201d CNN reached out to the commenter but did not get a response. On Krispy Kreme\u2019s own Instagram account, fans have even commented on posts unrelated to the \u201cFriends\u201d offer.

Lots of Friends fans here who would love to spend their money.\u201d Another Instagram user, Ashley Smith, commented under a different unrelated post, \u201cWhy the friends donuts only in the UK?! We\u2019d love to have them here as well!\u201d The doughnut selection includes \u201cFriends,\u201d a chocolate glazed doughnut topped with an image of the fountain in the show\u2019s opening credits. \u201cTrifle\u201d is a strawberry and custard filled doughnut that references a 1999 episode about a failed dessert. \u201cHow You Doin?\u201d echoes Monica Geller\u2019s (played by Courtney Cox) iconic front door.

{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_23_tech_apple-ringtone-by-the-seaside-alarm", "text": "One morning at 6 am, Gyaltsen Moktan woke in a panic. It was 2019. He worked at an all-you-can-eat sushi buffet and was responsible for opening the restaurant each morning. So he set a wakeup call on his iPhone. Then Apple\u2019s \u201cBy the Seaside\u201d alarm sound went off. Moktan chose the jaunty, cheerful tune available as a ringtone and alarm on many of Apple\u2019s devices, thinking that the song\u2019s easygoing melody would make waking up a peaceful experience. That bet soured. \u201cThe alarm is mocking you in a way. It\u2019s kind of like a horror movie, where they do the nursery rhyme before doom,\u201d said Moktan, now an English teacher in Tokyo, Japan. \u201cBy the Seaside\u201d is perhaps Apple\u2019s most polarizing alarm and ringtone, evoking comparisons to nails on a chalkboard, the word \u201cmoist\u201d and screaming children on a plane. In the past, phones had only one sound: the shrill, continuous ring of a landline. With so many ringtones now available, though, the sounds say more about how people express themselves \u2014 and what can cause stress and anxiety. You probably think you don\u2019t know \u201cBy the Seaside,\u201d but you do. On YouTube, there are extended versions, rap versions, versions played on various instruments. \u201cSome people think it\u2019s a great ringtone. And other people say, Oh, my God, it\u2019s terrible,\u201d said Carlos Xavier Rodriguez, chair of music theory at the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance, of the divisive tune. \u201cYou love it or you hate it.\u201d From knocker-uppers to chirping birds People have been trying to use sound to wake up reliably for centuries, relying on everything from church bells to roosters. Some people used to employ the services of knocker-uppers, or workers paid to wake customers by tapping on the door or window with a stick, until the 1970s in some parts of Britain. The first known alarm clock in the United States was invented by clockmaker Levi Hutchins of Concord, New Hampshire in 1787, but his clock rang just once at 4 am. In 1874, French inventor Antoine Redier patented an adjustable mechanical alarm clock. Seth Thomas patented a mechanical wind-up one a couple years later, and the electric alarm clock was invented by the end of the 19th century. (Its inventors probably didn\u2019t expect the iPhone.) Alarm clocks have evolved further since then. Some high-tech ones these days are designed to emit light mimicking sunrise, waking users gently with a soft glow and relaxing sounds such as birds twittering or the lilt of a flute. What is wrong with this song? Boston Flake, a 15-year old Utah high school student, says that \u201cBy the Seaside\u201d is the only alarm that can wake him up every morning for school. Far from a morning person, he has tried creating alarms himself that are mash-ups of songs, blaring sirens, horns and booming bass lines, to no avail. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a love-hate relationship,\u201d said Flake. \u201cSometimes I\u2019ll hear it in my dreams, and I\u2019ll get a little jolt and start freaking out.\u201d Apple did not respond to requests for comment. There are musical elements to \u201cBy the Seaside\u201d that make it difficult to listen to, says Rodriguez. There\u2019s no discernible key. The song doesn\u2019t end on a downbeat, so there\u2019s no feeling of resolution when it briefly pauses before repeating. But a bigger factor of users\u2019 emotional responses is the \u201cuncanny valley\u201d element to the tune, says Rodriguez. The uncanny valley phenomenon is the uneasy feeling people have towards life-like, but not quite human things such as robots, dolls or even clowns. \u201cBy the Seaside\u201d has an electronic, cheesy sound of a Casio keyboard that is reminiscent of computerized music eerily devoid of human touch, Rodrigo said. The alarm sound\u2019s critics are vocal with their displeasure: \u201cif ur alarm is \u2018by the seaside\u2019 you are one unserious\u201d person, says one viral post on X, using a somewhat spicier word than \u201cperson.\u201d It has received 160,000 likes and more than 15,000 reposts, with many users weighing in with their own thoughts. Some claim that the tune sends them into a \u201cflight or fight\u201d response. Others say the tune gives them heart palpitations and that it fills them with dread. So controversial is the nautical jingle that it\u2019s even spawned internet lore. Rumors have circulated on social media that pop singer Adele wrote the tune and that it has made her more money than her entire discography combined. Ryan Meadows, the creator of Fake Showbiz News, confirmed to CNN that he started that rumor. \u201cWe like to think [Adele would] find the joke funny. Perhaps it might even inspire her to compose a suite [of] ringtones for the iPhones of the future!\u201d Meadows, who goes by a pseudonym, wrote in an email to CNN. Representatives for Adele did not respond to requests for comment. To be sure, the tune has its supporters. Krystal Roxas, a biopharmaceuticals quality systems specialist in San Bruno, California, used to wake up to the default \u201cRadar\u201d alarm. She switched to \u201cBy the Seaside\u201d in 2018 after moving in with her boyfriend, who complained that her then-alarm sound made him anxious in the morning. She has been a faithful listener since. \u201cI love \u2018By the Seaside.\u2019 I don\u2019t know why people hate on it,\u201d said Roxas, 34. \u201cI actually let it play out until it\u2019s done. I do a little dance in bed.\u201d Moktan, 26, concedes that he believes users\u2019 hate for the alarm might stem from the fact that people just end up hating whatever wakes them up. He once tried to set Bill Withers and Grover Washington, Jr\u2019s \u201cJust the Two of Us\u201d as his alarm, before changing it because he began disliking the song, he says. \u201cI have yet to find an alarm I like,\u201d Moktan said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/tech/apple-ringtone-by-the-seaside-alarm/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_business_malls-lack-windows-curious-consumer", "text": "Decades ago, Americans flocked to Main Street to shop. A string of small family-owned stores stood next to each other along a tree-lined block or two, displaying their goods through large welcoming windows. Then in 1956 something happened that forever changed that shopping experience. A new retailing format packed up the hustle and bustle of Main Street commerce and recreated it inside of a very large boxy building that was \u2013 deliberately \u2013 devoid of windows. The birth of the American mall ushered in an era of \u201cwindowless\u201d shopping that\u2019s largely still here. The strategy was clever and little details in the planning \u2013- from the no-frills shoebox architecture to potted plants \u2013 were carefully thought out. These were cost-saving measures for mall operators that were also designed to influence mallgoers to spend freely. The unnaturally bright artificial lighting strived to create a perpetual daytime environment. This way, mall visitors would stay longer than they had expected to and spent more than they would have wanted to. Another reason for malls shunning windows did have something to do with the merchandising, Burt Flickinger, retail expert and managing director of retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group told CNN. Fewer windows and more walls, he said, meant more space for retailers to add shelves and rods to stock their products and maximize sales per square foot in their stores that would otherwise be lost to a dull view of a mall parking lot. But the sneakiest reason why malls limit windows could be to make shoppers lose track of time. \u201cShoppers can\u2019t see the rain storm or snow storm blowing in without windows. Windowless shopping creates an environment of consumption without distractions,\u201d Flickinger said. \u201cWhen people have a sense of timelessness and comfort, families spend more because they can focus just on the stores and the mall experience.\u201d Shock-and-awe on the inside The first fully enclosed mall \u2013 the Southdale Center in Minneapolis \u2013 opened in 1956. It became the prototype going forward as indoor climate-controlled malls that could stay open year-round popped up in suburbs across the country. The architect of the 1.2 million square feet Southdale Center was Austria-born Victor Gruen, considered the pioneer of modern mall design. He established Gruen Associates, a legacy architecture, planning and landscape firm still in existence and based in Los Angeles. He wanted to wow shoppers with shock-and-awe once they entered the building and took in the brightly-lit shops and cafes, even artwork exhibited around the mall. At the center of the mall layout would be a fountain or a skylight, possibly the only entry point to natural light coming into the expansive space. He added plants and music to create an inviting sensory experience. The structure of the traditional mall was either a T-shape, or a cross shape with the four anchor stores on either sides, Stephanie Cegielski, vice president of research with the International Council of Shopping Centers, told CNN. \u201cWhen you are walking around that \u2018T\u2019 everything is facing into you. As a shopper, you are perpetually looking at what is coming next and opposed to what\u2019s going on in the outside world,\u201d she said. Because all of the activity faced in, Cegielski said it didn\u2019t make sense for there to be windows per se, \u201cunless you were looking at a department store that has its own separate entrance into the mall that would create that window to the outside,\u201d she said. The exterior look was another story. The Southdale mall was functional and drab to look at and that is the blueprint that all traditional enclosed malls have continued to follow. \u201cMalls are really built to have the landscape on the inside. All of the architectural energy that we normally see on the outside of a building in an urban setting is focused internally. A mall is a machine for selling,\u201d Alexandra Lange, an architecture critic and author of \u201cMeet me by the fountain: An inside history of the mall\u201d said in an interview with CNN. The first round of malls in the mid-to-late 1950s did have more architecture on the outside, Lange said. \u201cBut the mall owners found that there was no increase in consumer interest based on that so let\u2019s  not waste money on that,\u201d she said. Fewer windows means lower energy bill As an added bonus, \u201cit was a lot less expensive for mall developers to not put multiple windows facing on the outside because it would make it cheaper to heat and cool the big-box space,\u201d said Thomas McMillan, director with the Center of Retailing Studies at Texas A&M University\u2019s Mays Business School, in an interview with CNN. Energy costs typically are the second-highest operating expense for retailers after labor costs. \u201cThe sophistication of double-pane energy-efficient windows wasn\u2019t ubiquitous when a lot of the malls were built in America during and after the 1970s energy crisis. So air conditioning could seep through the window panes,\u201d said Flickinger. The mall design inspired another type of store. Other shopping destinations that incorporate a windowless boxy venue are supermarkets. \u201cA typical grocery store layout has all of the fresh food around the outside that tends to be refrigerated. It\u2019s good for it to be next to a wall where there is power,\u201d Lange said. \u201cIf you cut windows into the wall, you have less space for refrigerated cases.\u201d Today, there are about 1,122 enclosed malls in the US, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. That\u2019s down from around 1,400 regional malls that existed around 15 years ago, according to Kristin Mueller, president, retail property management with\u00a0JLL, a real estate and investment management services firm, in an interview with CNN. But even with fewer enclosed malls in existence today, and just a handful of new malls built over the last decade (including the 3 million square foot American Dream Mall which opened in East Rutherford, New Jersey in 2019) that still abide by Gruen\u2019s blueprint, shoppers, especially Gen Z and Millennials, don\u2019t appear to be put off by their windowless aesthetic, she said. On average, 54% of US adult shoppers have visited a mall at least once a month in 2023 and spent an average of a little more than $300 each month last year, according to the latest data from the ICSC. As many as 70% of those shoppers were GenZers and 66% of them Millennials, according to the group. Mall retailing is evolving, however, said Cegielski. Families head to malls for entertainment as much as shopping, with people enjoying restaurants, movies, mini golf, pickleball courts and large indoor amusement centers that have been retrofitted inside of existing shopping centers. Some of these adaptive uses of traditional malls might be creating a practical need for windows after all, she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/business/malls-lack-windows-curious-consumer/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. It\u2019s tough being a Wall Street bear these days. The S&P 500 index has climbed nearly 15% this year and clinched 30 record-high closes. Strong corporate earnings and the artificial intelligence helped drive stocks higher at the start of this year, despite a slew of hotter-than-expected inflation reports that fueled concerns the Federal Reserve would be slow to cut interest rates in 2024. Then, fresh data in May revealed last week that inflation is cooling again and getting closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target. The central bank at its June policy meeting held rates steady and penciled in one cut for 2024. After waffling over whether the Fed would ease monetary policy at all in 2024, traders are now betting on two to three cuts, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The new backdrop of cooling inflation coupled with rate cuts on the horizon is prompting investors to up their bullish wagers. Goldman Sachs on Friday raised its year-end target for the benchmark index to 5,600 from 5,200, citing a strong outlook for corporate profits. That would be a 2.3% advance from Monday\u2019s close. Evercore ISI raised its price target to 6,000 for the S&P 500, a reversal from its previous, more gloomy 4,750 target. That higher level would be a 9.6% jump from Monday\u2019s close. \u201cThe backdrop of slowing inflation, a Fed intent on cutting rates and steady growth have supported Goldilocks,\u201d wrote Julian Emanuel, a senior managing director at Evercore ISI, in a Sunday note. \u201cThe rally has room.\u201d The market has also been distinguished by uncharacteristic calm. Stock sell-offs have been short and shallow. The S&P 500 has had its longest stretch of trading days without a 2% or more decline since February 2018, according to SoFi data as of June 12. While low volatility sounds like a positive, it\u2019s not without danger. It suggests that investors are taking on more risk in their portfolios due to an overly optimistic view and could be caught flat-footed if the tide turns. There\u2019s no shortage of risks that could unnerve markets in the coming months. Much of the S&P 500 index\u2019s returns are tied to the mega-cap tech Magnificent Seven stocks, leaving the market dependent on just a handful of names to continue its monster run. Stocks could also wobble leading up to the US presidential election in November. Some investors warn that despite encouraging economic data, a recession could still be in the cards for 2024 or next year. Despite its more bullish baseline target, Goldman Sachs warned that the S&P 500 index could end the year at 4,800, a 12.3% drop from current levels, if economic growth data turns sour and markets price in higher odds of a recession. The strange economics of pig meat: Ham prices are down, but bacon\u2019s up Shoppers in the meat aisle may have noticed something weird last month: Bacon prices are sizzling, but ham\u2019s not so hot, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner. Bacon is more expensive than it was a year ago, with prices up 6.9% from May 2023 to May of this year, according to inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Pork chops were up too, by 4.6%. But ham prices were lower, falling 5.4% overall and dropping 6.3% when you exclude canned varieties. What gives? Econ buffs may remember that prices are set according to supply and demand. You\u2019d expect any supply issues \u2014 like too many hogs, or too few \u2014 to cause prices of each of the items to move up or down, all in the same direction. The discrepancy, then, must be caused by differences on the demand side. And it is: Demand for domestic pork has grown in recent years outside of the US. But rising demand, plus the same or reduced supply, should push prices up, not down. So again, what gives? To understand you have to zoom out, looking at long-term retail pricing strategy and food price trends.

Then, he was told the purchase might get him prison time, reports my colleague Samantha Delouya. \u201cThat was really shocking to me. It\u2019s just purchasing property,\u201d Bian, who is originally from Nanjing, China, said. \u201cOnce I learned that, I didn\u2019t even bother to look anymore.\u201d Bian, a 31-year-old software engineer who has lived in the US for 12 years, is a recipient of an H-1B visa, which allows companies to employ foreign workers. For nearly a year, however, it has been a crime for him to purchase a home in Florida after the state\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, signed a law restricting Chinese nationals without US green cards from purchasing property in the state. Bian and other Florida residents told CNN that the rules have fostered uneasiness and confusion among ethnic Chinese people living in the state. Some say the law has damaged their businesses, while others say they are considering abandoning Florida altogether. And the law underscores the heightened tensions between the two biggest economies in the world in a US presidential election year. Bian said that lately, he had begun reconsidering his life in Florida. He isn\u2019t alone. Ever since Florida Senate Bill 264 went into effect on July 1, 2023, Chinese citizens without green cards face a felony charge and possible prison time if they purchase property in the state. Sellers and real estate agents can also be found liable under the law.

{"id": "2024_06_24_investing_premarket-stocks-trading", "text": "Traders could be forgiven for breaking out their champagne glasses, even though 2024 isn\u2019t halfway done yet. US stocks have leaped from all-time high to all-time high this year: the S&P 500 has surpassed its own record a staggering 31 times since January. That equates to a new all-time high about every four trading days. Investors have shrugged off elevated interest and inflation rates, a chaotic political and global environment and general economic uncertainty to give markets the best start to an election year on record. What\u2019s happening: Presidential election years are typically good for stocks. The S&P 500 alone has generated an average return of 7% during presidential election years since 1952, according to LPL Financial. If you limit that to election years in which the incumbent president is running for reelection, the average jumps to 12.2%. This year, the index has already far surpassed those average gains. The S&P 500 is 14.6% higher year-to-date \u2014 the best start to an election year on record, according to Goldman Sachs \u2014 and up nearly 31% from its October 2023 low at 4,117 points. So why is this election cycle different from all the others that have gone before? Gains are typically higher when incumbent presidents run for reelection, most likely because investors crave stability. And this election is the first since 1892 that the nominees of both major parties have occupied the White House, notes Ed Clissold, chief US strategist at Ned Davis Research. If one incumbent running for office reduces uncertainty, then two incumbents really reduces uncertainty. That could pull the typical year-end election relief rally forward, said Clissold. A reason to celebrate: Not only are stocks up, they\u2019re rarely going down. It\u2019s been 333 days since the S&P 500 recorded a decline of 2% or greater, which is the longest stretch since February 2018, wrote Goldman Sachs\u2019 Scott Rubner in a recent note to clients. His outlook for the latter half of the year remains positive \u2014 a good first half means a \u201cvery good\u201d second half, he wrote. \u201cThe impressive market rally continues, notable not only for its strength but also for its stability,\u201d wrote Nationwide\u2019s chief of investment research, Mark Hackett, in a note Friday. \u201c[T]here is no reason that the steady march higher can\u2019t persist, particularly as we approach the tailwind from election seasonality.\u201d Last week\u2019s rally was broad, assuaging some concerns from investors that recent gains have been concentrated in a few big names like tech darling Nvidia, which is up more than 155% so far this year. The equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 rose 1.12% and the small cap Russell 2000 gained 0.79% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was flat on the week. The sustained gains are causing some analysts to raise their year-end targets for the S&P 500.  Scott Chronert, research head of US equity strategy at Citigroup, raised his year-end target to 5,600 from 5,100 last week. Analysts at Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and UBS have also revised their expectations for the broad-based index higher. Yes, but: Market volatility in an election year tends to pick up in October and there are many months left in this cycle with potential surprises to come. Thursday brings CNN\u2019s televised debate between President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump. \u201cThere is plenty of scope for big headlines and for the candidates to gather some momentum or see it go into reverse,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank\u2019s Jim Reid. There\u2019s also the prospect that investors get complacent and begin to take the current bull market for granted. \u201cThe longer optimism remains high, the bigger the risk that it turns into complacency and leaves the market vulnerable to the next piece of negative news,\u201d said Clissold with Ned Davis Research. \u201cAn autumn pullback fits well time wise with potential downside earnings revisions, make-or-break decision time for the Fed, and election uncertainty. The risk is that one or more of those catalysts prove to be longer lasting, turning a pullback into something more,\u201d he said. A global view: The United States isn\u2019t the only country with an upcoming election. France and the UK both face elections in the coming weeks. While opinion polls suggest the opposition centre-left Labour Party is heading for a comfortable victory in the UK on July 4, the situation in France is much more uncertain, and markets have been rattled. French President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election after his centrist Renaissance party lost heavily to the far-right opposition in European elections. The first round of the French election will be held on June 30, with a second round on July 7. \u201cPolitical uncertainty is a near-term headwind to both sentiment (reflected through financial markets) and, now, activity,\u201d wrote Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management, of the upcoming elections. Until July, \u201cwe can anticipate volatility in European equity and debt markets.\u201d Alaska Airlines reaches tentative labor deal with flight attendants Alaska Airlines and its 7,000-member flight attendants union reached a tentative labor deal late Friday, concluding talks that lasted more than a year and a half, reports my colleague Chris Isidore. Terms of the deal have not been released, though the union called it a \u201crecord contract.\u201d The deal likely contains a significant pay raise, which has been a common demand across the airline industry and sought by unions whose members in some cases have not seen a pay increase in years. In April, the union announced to members it was seeking pay raises of between 43% to 56%, depending upon seniority, through 2026. Those pay raises would include back pay covering a period dating back a year and a half that they\u2019ve worked under the terms of the previous contract. In February, flight attendants from Alaska \u2014 along with American, United and Southwest \u2014held unprecedented coordinated\u00a0pickets\u00a0demanding new contracts. Since then, flight attendants at Southwest reached a deal that included an immediate 22.3% raise as of May 1 and $364 million in retroactive wages. Meanwhile, flight attendants at American and United are still seeking new deals. American flight attendants have asked to be released from restrictions so they can go on strike, but even if that is granted there would be months of cooling off periods before they could walk out, under the Railway Labor Act. Apple\u2019s new China problem: ChatGPT is banned there Apple is banking on its upcoming AI features to boost iPhone sales especially in China, where demand has been lagging. But there\u2019s a problem, reports my CNN colleague Samantha Murphy Kelly, ChatGPT \u2014 soon to be integrated into Siri \u2014 is banned in China. In a presentation earlier this month, Apple (AAPL) showed off its proprietary technology called Apple Intelligence to power compelling new AI\u00a0features\u00a0and announced a\u00a0partnership with OpenAI\u00a0to also use its viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity. (When Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry, ChatGPT can step in.) The move signaled how Apple is trying to expedite the latest buzzy technology at a time when tech rivals, such as Microsoft, Google, Meta and Samsung, have already found their AI\u00a0footing. A deal with OpenAI could help Apple close the gap. But\u00a0China\u00a0is one of the first countries in the world to regulate the generative AI technology that powers these popular services. In August, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s top internet watchdog, rolled out\u00a0new guidelines\u00a0for the industry, requiring companies to seek approval before deployment. The organization\u00a0has approved\u00a0more than 100 AI models as of March, all from Chinese companies. According to\u00a0a report\u00a0from the Wall Street Journal Thursday, Apple is looking for a Chinese AI company to partner with ahead of the iPhone\u2019s expected September launch, but it hasn\u2019t reached a deal yet. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The need to find a partner \u2014 and quickly \u2014 comes at a time when Apple\u2019s smartphone sales\u00a0tumbled\u00a0a stunning 10% in the first quarter of this year, according to market research firm IDC, due largely to iPhone sales sharply dropping in China. The company has lost momentum in China as nationalism, a rough economy and increased competition have also hurt sales. China is the company\u2019s second-largest market.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

For fans of its \u201cSquid Game\u201d dark drama and related reality show, for example, Netflix promises to recreate the program\u2019s Glass Bridge challenge. Competitors walk or jump across clear panels that shatter \u2014 and drop them \u2014 if they stand on the wrong one. It\u2019s a risky move. Critics of the expansion note that attracting repeat business will be challenging. \u201cOne of the keys to success will be to keep the offer refreshed, so that it keeps people coming back to what\u2019s new,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData. Netflix has already had considerable success with elaborate touring productions and events tied to some of its higher-profile programming. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is currently hosting a tour of \u201cBridgerton\u201d High Tea; Toronto has a \u201cKnives Out\u201d dinner party; and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil offers an immersive \u201cStranger Things\u201d experience. Risks and rewards All this is not a new idea, though. \u201cDisney has monetized its content for years and has a very successful retail business through licensing, its own stores, and shop-in-shop concepts,\u201d said Saunders. For Netflix, it\u2019s just the latest move in a series of efforts to broaden its profile and income beyond standard streaming\u2014 even though the bulk of its profits have come from its core business. These new initiatives come at a time profits in the streaming industry are getting squeezed. So the company has cut back on creating original programming but has expanded its video game offerings, rolling out mobile-friendly games from the \u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d franchise. In a brand extension, It also partnered with Williams Sonoma on a line of \u201cBridgerton\u201d-themed dinnerware, paper goods, foods and linens. TikTok influencer, product reviewer and \u201cBridgerton\u201d fan Carrie Berk, who has twice attended \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Ball\u201d said she thinks Netflix\u2019s new venture will be met with success. (She was not compensated by Netflix or given tickets to the events.) \u201cI think that it\u2019s brilliant that Netflix is bringing that magic IRL!\u201d she said. (IRL stands for \u201cin real life.\u201d) For years, \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Ball\u201d has been staged in various cities two or three times daily. Fans could enjoy dances and watch performances by violin players and acrobats dressed in historically accurate garb under chandelier lighting. In keeping with the show\u2019s plot, the Queen named a \u201cDiamond of the Season\u201d at each performance. Social media influencers were invited to write a letter and make their case for why they should be chosen, illustrating Netflix\u2019s keen interest in the social media world. Now, \u201cNetflix House represents the next generation of our distinctive offerings,\u201d said Netflix Chief Marketing Officer Marian Lee, in a statement. \u201cThe venues will bring our beloved stories to life in new ever-changing, and unexpected ways.\u201d Berk agreed and told CNN of her experience, \u201cIt really made me feel like I stepped into the world of the show.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/business/netflix-house-locations-experiential-venues/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_23_cars_eu-china-ev-import-tariffs-talks-intl-hnk", "text": "China\u00a0and the\u00a0European Union have agreed to start talks on the planned imposition of tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) being imported into the\u00a0European market, senior officials of both sides said on Saturday. Germany\u2019s Economy Minister Robert Habeck said he had been informed by\u00a0EU\u00a0Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis that there would be concrete negotiations on tariffs with\u00a0China. The confirmation came after\u00a0China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said its head Wang Wentao, and Dombrovskis, executive vice president of the\u00a0European Commission, had agreed to start consultations over the\u00a0EU\u2019s anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs. \u201cThis is new and surprising in that it has not been possible to enter into a concrete negotiation timetable in the last few weeks,\u201d Habeck said in Shanghai. He said it was a first step and many more will be necessary. \u201cWe are far from the end, but at least, it is a first step that was not possible before.\u201d The minister had said earlier on Saturday that the\u00a0European Union\u2019s door was open for discussions regarding\u00a0EU\u00a0tariffs\u00a0on Chinese exports. \u201cWhat I suggested to my Chinese partners today is that the doors are open for discussions and I hope that this message was heard,\u201d he said in his first statement in Shanghai, after meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing. Habeck\u2019s visit is the first by a senior\u00a0European official since Brussels proposed hefty duties on imports of Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) to combat what the\u00a0EU\u00a0considers excessive subsidies. Habeck said there is time for a dialog between the\u00a0EU\u00a0and\u00a0China\u00a0on tariff issues before the duties come into full effect in November and that he believes in open markets but that markets require a level playing field. Proven subsidies that are intended to increase the export advantages of companies can\u2019t be accepted, the minister said. Another point of tension between Beijing and Berlin is\u00a0China\u2019s support for Russia in its war in Ukraine. Habeck noted Chinese trade with Russia increased more than 40% last year. Habeck said he had told Chinese officials that this was taking a toll on their economic relationship. \u201cCircumventions of the sanctions imposed on Russia are not acceptable,\u201d he said, adding that technical goods produced in\u00a0Europe should not end up on the battlefield via other countries. Not a \u2018punishment\u2019 The\u00a0EU\u2019s provisional duties of up to 38.1% on imported Chinese EVs are set to apply by July 4, with the investigation set to continue until November 2, when definitive duties, typically for five years, could be imposed. \u201cThis opens a phase where negotiations are possible, discussions are important and dialog is needed,\u201d Habeck said. Proposed\u00a0EU\u00a0tariffs on Chinese goods are not a \u201cpunishment,\u201d Habeck told Chinese officials earlier in Beijing. \u201cIt is important to understand that these are not punitive tariffs,\u201d he said in the first plenary session of a climate and transformation dialog. Countries such as the United States, Brazil and Turkey had used punitive tariffs, but not the\u00a0EU, he said. \u201cEurope does things differently.\u201d Habeck said the\u00a0European Commission had for nine months examined in detail whether Chinese companies had benefited unfairly from subsidies. Any countervailing duty measure that results from the\u00a0EU\u00a0review \u201cis not a punishment,\u201d he said, adding that such measures were meant to compensate for the advantages granted to Chinese companies by Beijing. Zheng Shanjie, chairman of\u00a0China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission, responded: \u201cWe will do everything to protect Chinese companies.\u201d Proposed\u00a0EU\u00a0duties on Chinese-made EVs would hurt both sides, Zheng added. He told Habeck he hoped Germany would demonstrate leadership within the\u00a0EU\u00a0and \u201cdo the correct thing.\u201d He also denied accusations of unfair subsidies, saying the development of\u00a0China\u2019s new energy industry was the result of comprehensive advantages in technology, market and industry supply chains, fostered in fierce competition. The industry\u2019s growth \u201cis the result of competition, rather than subsidies, let alone unfair competition,\u201d Zheng said during the meeting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/cars/eu-china-ev-import-tariffs-talks-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_business_apple-eu-competition-rules", "text": "European Union regulators have accused Apple of breaking tough new digital competition rules by preventing app developers from freely directing consumers to cheaper services. The European Commission\u2019s preliminary findings stem from an investigation opened in March. If found guilty, the company could face a fine of up to 10% of its $383 billion annual global revenue, the EU\u2019s executive arm said in a statement Monday. The fine can be increased to 20% of the company\u2019s global revenue if it repeats the offense, it added. Monday\u2019s action marks the first time the Commission has accused a company of breaching its landmark Digital Markets Act. The DMA, which came into force in March, is a sweeping set of\u00a0competition rules aimed at curbing the power of Big Tech. That month, the Commission announced that it had launched investigations into Apple (AAPL), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook parent Meta (META) on suspicion they were failing to comply with the DMA. The three companies have been designated as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d by the Commission \u2014\u00a0Big Tech firms crucial to interactions between businesses and consumers through their links to \u201ccore platform services,\u201d such as digital marketplaces and app stores. The Commission must reach the final decision on whether Apple has failed to comply with the DMA within one year from the opening of its investigation on March 25. Apple said in a statement Monday that, over the past few months, it had \u201cmade a number of changes to comply with the DMA in response to feedback from developers and the European Commission. We are confident our plan complies with the law.\u201d More scrutiny The Commission has provisionally found that, according to the rules of Apple\u2019s app store, \u201cdevelopers cannot provide pricing information within the app\u201d or communicate \u201cin any other way\u201d with their customers to steer them toward offers available on alternative platforms. Apple allows so-called \u201csteering\u201d by developers only through links in their apps that redirect customers to a web page, the Commission said. But that \u201clink-out process is subject to several restrictions,\u201d it added. \u201cToday is a very important day for the effective enforcement of the DMA,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the EU\u2019s competition and digital chief, said in Monday\u2019s statement. \u201cSteering is key to ensure that app developers are less dependent on gatekeepers\u2019 app stores and for consumers to be aware of better offers.\u201d Apple said in its statement: \u201cAll developers doing business in the EU on the App Store have the opportunity to utilize the capabilities that we have introduced, including the ability to direct app users to the web to complete purchases at a very competitive rate. As we have done routinely, we will continue to listen and engage with the European Commission.\u201d The Commission also said it had opened another investigation, into whether Apple\u2019s new contractual requirements for app developers breach the DMA. These requirements include a \u201ccore technology fee,\u201d which charges developers of third-party apps \u20ac0.50 ($0.54) each time their app is installed. The Commission\u2019s initial findings against Apple come only months after it fined the company \u20ac1.84 billion ($1.97 billion) for preventing rival music streaming services such as Spotify from telling iPhone users that they could find cheaper ways to subscribe outside of Apple\u2019s app store. It was the bloc\u2019s first-ever antitrust penalty on the US tech giant. Apple said in a statement at the time that app developers \u201ccompete on a level playing field\u201d on its app store and that it planned to appeal the fine. In January, Apple announced\u00a0changes\u00a0to its handling of apps in the EU in anticipation of the DMA coming into effect. That included plans to allow third-party app stores on iPhones and iPads for the first time\u00a0in\u00a0the company\u2019s history\u00a0and significant cuts to its app store fees.

{"id": "2024_06_24_tech_china-huawei-harmony-os-growth-intl-hnk", "text": "Huawei is in the midst of one of the most stunning comebacks in the history of the tech industry. The Chinese giant, which has been a flashpoint in the escalating rivalry between Washington and Beijing, says more than 900 million smartphones now use its in-house operating system Harmony OS. \u201cWe have done in 10 years what our European and American counterparts have done in more than 30 years, and have achieved independent control of the core technology of the operating system,\u201d Richard Yu, the chairman of Huawei\u2019s consumer business group, said at a developer forum on Friday. Harmony, which is called \u201cHongmeng\u201d in Chinese, was first unveiled in 2019, months after Huawei was placed on a US trade blacklist that barred American firms from\u00a0selling tech and software\u00a0to the Chinese tech company without a license. US policymakers have long claimed that Huawei poses a national security risk, alleging that the Chinese government could use the company\u2019s equipment to spy. The company repeatedly denied those allegations, but that didn\u2019t stop some American allies \u2014 such as the UK \u2014 limiting Huawei\u2019s role in building 5G networks. The US ban prevented companies like Google\u00a0(GOOGL)\u00a0from supplying new Huawei devices with its version of Android OS. Those restrictions dealt a huge blow to the Chinese firm\u2019s smartphone ambitions at the time, with some analysts predicting the Huawei phone would become \u201ca brick.\u201d Now the company is once again making its way back to the top. It\u2019s also venturing into new businesses. Last year, it launched an electric sedan to take on Tesla\u2019s Model S. And it has big ambitions in artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia (NVDA), which is running neck and neck with Microsoft (MSFT) as the\u00a0most valuable public company\u00a0in the world, earlier this year named Huawei a top competitor in a number of areas, including in the\u00a0production of processors\u00a0that power AI systems. Yu said Friday that Huawei\u2019s own AI framework, composed of its Ascend processors, was 1.1 times more effective in training large language models than mainstream international offerings. He did not name the competitors. A surprise development But it\u2019s in smartphones that the revival is so far most obvious. Sales of Huawei\u2019s flagship smartphones rose 72% in the first five months of 2024, compared to the same period a year ago, Yu added, underscoring the company\u2019s ambitions to claw its way back to the top despite severe US restrictions. The Shenzhen-based conglomerate\u2019s popular Mate 60 Pro smartphone made headlines last year when the US government\u00a0sought more information\u00a0about the model, which included a sophisticated processor. Its debut shocked industry experts who questioned how the company could\u00a0acquire\u00a0such  chips following sweeping efforts by the US to restrict China\u2019s access to foreign chip technology because of national security concerns. The company\u2019s net profit soared 564% to $2.71 billion in the first quarter, and that robust jump comes after it recorded its\u00a0fastest revenue growth\u00a0in four years in 2023, thanks to a pick-up in its consumer segment and income from new businesses like smart car components. Huawei is also going after another of the biggest companies in the world. The success of its smartphones in China have directly impacted Apple (AAPL) in the premium segment, according to data from Counterpoint Research in April. The iPhone maker, which led China\u2019s smartphone market with a near 20% share in the first quarter of 2023, fell to third spot in the first three months of\u00a0this\u00a0year, according to Counterpoint. Its market share stood at 15.7%, while Huawei\u2019s jumped to 15.5%, from 9.3% in 2023. Sales of the iPhone began bouncing back in May, after the company aggressively cut prices in its largest overseas market.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/tech/china-huawei-harmony-os-growth-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

When will\u00a0Jeff Bezos\u00a0actually\u00a0address the upheaval roiling his newsroom? The Washington Post\u00a0owner and\u00a0Amazon\u00a0billionaire has yet to take any real action to quell concerns at his newspaper, which remains engulfed in disarray as explosive reports are published day after day throwing the ethical integrity of the outlet\u2019s new publisher,\u00a0Will Lewis, into serious question. Staffers at The Post are losing their patience with Bezos, whose only action thus far responding to the Lewis calamity has been to fire off a paltry, 138-word, single-paragraph memo from his\u00a0Mediterranean\u00a0yachting vacation to a handful of leaders at The Post, assuring them that he wants standards to remain \u201cvery high.\u201d In the eyes of staffers at The Post, that is the very issue. They too want standards to remain \u201cvery high\u201d and fear that Lewis poses an active danger to that shared goal. More drama unfolded Friday after the Lewis announced Robert Winnett, who Lewis named as the paper\u2019s incoming editor, would not to come to lead the Post. That follows a 3,000-word front page expose this week, in which\u00a0The Post\u00a0reported\u00a0that Winnett had previously used materials from a self-described \u201cthief\u201d for reporting. Frustrations and concerns are so high at the outlet that two of the institution\u2019s\u00a0Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists have\u00a0chosen to speak out\u00a0on the record, calling for a change in leadership, an unheard of step at the storied newspaper.\u00a0David Maraniss, an associate editor who has worked at The Post for nearly five decades, said he doesn\u2019t \u201cknow a single person at the Post who thinks the current situation with the publisher and supposed new editor can stand.\u201d And\u00a0Scott Higham, who has worked at The Post for more than two decades, agreed and called for Lewis\u2019 head. \u201cWill Lewis needs to step down for the good of The Post and the public,\u201d wrote Higham on Facebook. \u201cHe has lost the newsroom and will never win it back.\u201d Suffice to say, Maraniss and Higham are just saying aloud what much of the newsroom is thinking. In conversations with more than a dozen people inside and close to The Post this week, it\u2019s been made clear that Lewis, in his brief six months on the job, has\u00a0totally\u00a0alienated staff and now faces insurmountable odds to win back the employee base he seeks to lead. Whether he has good business ideas or not, is not the question. He\u2019s lost the respect of his staff. And any good leader will tell you, without a legitimacy to lead, it is unfeasible to get anything done, let alone stage a Herculean business transformation. A spokesperson for Bezos did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday. But surely the billionaire understands the dire situation gripping The Post. And it taxes the imagination to believe that he really believes his brief memo to The Post\u2019s leadership was enough to extinguish the concerns that have spurred the unprecedented uproar at the newspaper. In fact, it\u2019s notable that Bezos has not explicitly voiced support for Lewis in recent days, giving him options as he evaluates the deteriorating situation and determines how to stem the bleeding. Staffers at The Post are very much waiting for Bezos to take some\u00a0meaningful\u00a0form of action. Since anger at Lewis erupted earlier this month, CNN has been repeatedly told by those who work at the outlet that the ongoing drama has distracted the newsroom from its invaluable work. Suffice to say, with a high-stakes election only months away, it is anything but ideal to have the attention of one of the nation\u2019s preeminent news organizations diverted by internal turmoil whirling within its walls. It\u2019s \u201ca massive distraction,\u201d one Postie underscored to me Thursday, adding that\u00a0The Guardian\u2019s\u00a0eyebrow-raising story\u00a0accusing Lewis of having once advised then-U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u00a0to \u201cclean up\u201d his phone during the so-called \u201cPartygate\u201d scandals is \u201cthe talk of the newsroom.\u201d (Lewis and Johnson denied the story.) \u201cI don\u2019t think the mood will change until something else changes,\u201d the staffer added. In the absence of Bezos, the stories raising questions about Lewis\u2019 ethical integrity keep coming. The\u00a0Financial Times\u00a0reported Thursday\u00a0that Lewis still \u201cretains links\u201d to a public relations firm that advises high-powered corporate and political leaders how to navigate thorny situations. While the FT reported Lewis had sold his ownership stake in the business, the outlet noted the firm has \u201ccontinued to distribute regular emails from Lewis,\u201d causing \u201cconfusion among people in contact with the agency.\u201d While the FT\u2019s Thursday story certainly did not carry with it the same weight as the reports that have been published in recent days from other news outlets, it added yet additional questions about Lewis\u2019 history and entanglements. Meanwhile, it is likely that many more questions will be raised in the future as The Post and outlets such as\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0continue to take a hard look at Lewis\u2019 history. And as those questions keep coming, those at The Post will certainly have one in particular for Bezos: What are you planning to do to restore the respect and status of your storied newspaper?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/media/washington-post-staffers-jeff-bezos-publisher-crisis/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

Homeowners in America aren\u2019t the only ones struggling with an unaffordable housing market. Renters are also bearing the brunt. A report from Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies released last week showed that both homeowners and renters in recent years have become increasingly burdened by climbing housing costs. The report, based on an analysis of existing data, said that nearly one in four households that own a home \u201care now stretched worryingly thin.\u201d The cost burdens are even worse for renters. \u201cFor renters, the landscape is even more challenging,\u201d the Harvard report said. \u201cWhile rents have been rising faster than incomes for decades, the pandemic-era rent surge produced an unprecedented affordability crisis.\u201d Renters who spend more than half of their household income on housing and utilities rose in 2022 to a new record high of 12.1 million, up 1.5 million from levels seen before the Covid-19 pandemic. Allocating such a high proportion of household income to rent makes them vulnerable to becoming unhoused if they face an unexpected financial issue, such as an unexpected medical bill. That\u2019s all part of a broader struggle in the US housing market, and recent data shows that it hasn\u2019t gotten any better. A persistent lack of homes available for sale is spurring bidding wars. Elevated mortgage rates are keeping sellers and some buyers on the sidelines. \u201cHousing costs are a particular pain point for American households,\u201d Lael Brainard, director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, said Thursday at an event in Washington. \u201cCongress really does need to act here,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Senate could act tomorrow and we would have tax credits for 200,000 additional affordable units,\u201d referring to a bill that recently passed the US House. Speaking at an event hosted by the Urban Institute, Brainard outlined the Biden administration\u2019s attempts to fix America\u2019s housing market, such as a cap on annual rent increases for the 2 million households in \u201clow-income housing tax credit\u201d units and a reduction in Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance premiums that took effect in the spring. \u201cAlready, nearly 700,000 homeowners are saving roughly $900 annually as a result of the Administration\u2019s reduction in mortgage interest premiums for FHA-backed loans,\u201d Brainard said. The Harvard report said that \u201cstate and local experimentation with regulatory reforms and incentives will incrementally add affordable homes\u201d and that there\u2019s a pressing \u201cneed for down payment support and access to low-interest mortgage products to close racial gaps and put homeownership within reach for households with modest incomes.\u201d Apple\u2019s new China problem: ChatGPT is banned there Apple is banking on its upcoming AI features to boost iPhone sales especially in China, where demand has been lagging. But there\u2019s a problem: ChatGPT \u2014 soon to be integrated into Siri \u2014 is banned in China, reports my colleague Samantha Murphy Kelly. In a presentation earlier this month, Apple (AAPL) showed off its proprietary technology called Apple Intelligence to power compelling new AI\u00a0features\u00a0and announced a\u00a0partnership with OpenAI\u00a0to also use its viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity. (When Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry, ChatGPT can step in.) The move signaled how Apple is trying to expedite the latest buzzy technology at a time when tech rivals, such as Microsoft, Google, Meta and Samsung, have already found their AI\u00a0footing. A deal with OpenAI could help Apple close the gap. But China is one of the first countries in the world to regulate the generative AI technology that powers these popular services. In August, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s top internet watchdog, rolled out new guidelines for the industry, requiring companies to seek approval before deployment. The organization has approved more than 100 AI models as of March, all from Chinese companies. Read more here. Up Next Monday:\u00a0Fed Governor Christopher Waller delivers remarks.

{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

The shareholder lawsuit accused the apparel maker and CEO\u00a0Kevin Plank\u00a0of intentionally misleading them about the company\u2019s financial health. In 2021, the Baltimore-based company had agreed to pay $9 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges that it misled investors about its revenue growth.

{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_23_business_cdk-cyber-attack-global-outage", "text": "Retail software provider CDK Global says it will likely take several days for its software to be back online and operational, as the company grapples with a system\u00a0outage that has paralyzed nearly 15,000 car dealerships across North America since Wednesday. The data provider\u2019s software, which dealerships use to manage everything from scheduling to records, said Saturday it has begun restoring its software. \u201cWe anticipate that the process will take several days to complete, and in the interim we are continuing to actively engage with our customers and provide them with alternative\u00a0ways to conduct business,\u201d a CDK spokesperson told CNN on Saturday. CDK has said it is working to investigate the shutdown after two cyber incidents brought its systems to a standstill. The company has not confirmed who was behind the incidents. Bloomberg previously reported the company was negotiating with an Eastern European-based hacker group demanding tens of millions of dollars in ransom to end the outage. CDK has not responded Sunday to CNN\u2019s request for comment about the reported ransom. Dealers implement temporary solutions Many car manufacturers and dealerships have scrambled to implement temporary solutions to maintain retail operations while their computer software remains offline. In an automated message via its toll-free number Saturday, CDK advised dealership employees to be cautious of phishing scams and take precautions to secure sensitive information such as passwords. Mike Stanton, the president and CEO of the National Automobile Dealers Association, told CNN in a statement the group \u201ccontinues seeking information from CDK on the nature and scope of the cyber incident, so dealers are able to respond appropriately.\u201d \u201cThousands of franchised new-car dealerships rely on CDK to run their businesses and this outage has impacted dealers\u2019 ability to provide a seamless customer experience and process transactions efficiently,\u201d he added. The system shutdown could slow down business and cause shipping delays at dealerships as the summer season gears up. Dealership sales in 2023 topped $1.2 trillion in the United States, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. Car manufacturer Ford told CNN it is working with dealers to set up alternative software systems and other workarounds. A company spokesperson emphasized the effects of the outage will vary from dealer to dealer. Ford said it encourages customers to contact their local dealership for information. Several dealerships on the East Coast told CNN on Sunday they are manually filling out forms to process sales. Some businesses mentioned they are having issues with registering purchased cars with the state, as they rely on CDK\u2019s software to send registration information to their respective motor vehicle department. One used car dealership told CNN it has been filing paperwork by hand and sending runners to the car registry with the paperwork. Another dealer said they\u2019re still selling cars but can\u2019t complete transactions in a timely manner. In a Friday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Penske Automotive said while its auto dealers don\u2019t use CDK Global, its Premier Trucking Group division \u2014 which mainly serve businesses \u2014 does use CDK\u2019s dealer management system. Penske said it was working on implementing response plans and its 48 PTG locations remain operational. In another SEC filing, Sonic Automotive said it was also operational but was instating \u201cworkaround solutions to minimize the disruption\u00a0caused by this CDK outage.\u201d The company added the incident will likely negatively impact Sonic\u2019s financial and business operations. Premier Truck Group declined to elaborate on its response plans. Sonic did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/business/cdk-cyber-attack-global-outage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_tech_apple-ai-chatgpt-ban-china", "text": "Apple is banking on its upcoming AI features to boost iPhone sales especially in China, where demand has been lagging. But there\u2019s a problem: ChatGPT \u2014 soon to be integrated into Siri \u2014 is banned in China. In a presentation earlier this month, Apple (AAPL) showed off its proprietary technology called Apple Intelligence to power compelling new AI features and announced a partnership with OpenAI to also use its viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity. (When Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry, ChatGPT can step in.) The move signaled how Apple is trying to expedite the latest buzzy technology at a time when tech rivals, such as Microsoft, Google, Meta and Samsung, have already found their AI footing. A deal with OpenAI could help Apple close the gap. But China is one of the first countries in the world to regulate the generative AI technology that powers these popular services. In August, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s top internet watchdog, rolled out new guidelines for the industry, requiring companies to seek approval before deployment. The organization has approved more than 100 AI models as of March, all from Chinese companies. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal Thursday, Apple is looking for a Chinese AI company to partner with ahead of the iPhone\u2019s expected September launch, but it hasn\u2019t reached a deal yet. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The need to find a partner \u2014 and quickly \u2014 comes at a time when Apple\u2019s smartphone sales tumbled a stunning 10% in the first quarter of this year, according to market research firm IDC, due largely to iPhone sales sharply dropping in China. The company has lost momentum in China as nationalism, a rough economy and increased competition have also hurt sales. China is the company\u2019s second-largest market. Trouble in the EU Limitations on its new AI tools may not be specific to China. In a statement sent to CNN following the publication of this article, Apple said it \u201chighly motivated\u201d to bring the features to customers around the world, but it is facing regulatory challenges in the European Union, as well. The company said it doesn\u2019t believe it will be able to roll out its AI features in Europe this year. \u201cDue to the regulatory uncertainties brought about by the Digital Markets Act (DMA), we do not believe that we will be able to roll out three of these features\u2014iPhone Mirroring, SharePlay Screen Sharing enhancements, and Apple Intelligence\u2014to our EU users this year,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cSpecifically, we are concerned that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security,\u201d it added. \u201cWe are committed to collaborating with the European Commission in an attempt to find a solution that would enable us to deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety.\u201d Resurgent competitors In China, concerns around iPhone sales continue to mount as Chinese smartphone brand Huawei\u2019s smartphone sales growth was 70% in the first quarter, according to Counterpoint Research. If a solution is not worked out by fall, Chinese consumers may feel short changed and choose to wait until they can get the full AI experience with Apple, she added. \u201cApple is very likely to seek a local partner in China in place of OpenAI, because simply put, it needs to,\u201d said Nabila Popal, a senior director at IDC Research. \u201cChinese consumers are expecting\u00a0their premium phones to have the latest AI functionality and may\u00a0hesitate to spend over $1000 for devices that don\u2019t have all the AI bells and whistles.\u201d \u201cThe real growth in China for Apple will come in the long term, as Apple Intelligence evolves offering more use cases, extends language support beyond English and when Siri can leverage other local AI models to provide the ChatGPT-like function,\u201d Popal said. In the meantime, some AI companies in China may be better suited to target its consumers anyway, such as by offering more local dialects than what\u2019s currently found in foreign AI models, Reece Hayden, an analyst at ABI Research, noted. Apple wouldn\u2019t be the first foreign company to work with the Cyberspace Administration of China for AI and smartphones. In January, Samsung teamed up with Chinese tech giant Baidu (BIDU) to use its AI model to help power its translation service. It works with another AI firm Meitu for photo editing tools. In other parts of the world, Samsung uses its own propriety AI technology, along with Google\u2019s (GOOGL) AI model Gemini, which is also banned in China. Samsung, however, accounts for less than 1% of the total market in China, according to Counterpoint Research. Although the clock is ticking for Apple to secure a partnership ahead of its fall software launch, Jeff Fieldhack, a research director at Counterpoint, believes it will be able to ink a deal in time. \u201cApple should be able to have a partnership aligned very quickly because it has such a strong global install base, and it would be a gem for these companies to work with them,\u201d he said, noting that they\u2019d soon be established as an an AI power player in the country.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/tech/apple-ai-chatgpt-ban-china/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_business_boeings-ceo-responsible", "text": "For all the mistakes and safety problems Boeing has managed under CEO Dave Calhoun\u2019s watch \u2014 resulting in a dozen corporate whistleblowers, multiple groundings and a chunk of a plane\u2019s fuselage literally blowing off in midair \u2014 virtually no one has held him to account. Not Boeing\u2019s board of directors, which has responded by lavishing him with a salary and stock options worth more than $20 million a year, plus a $45 million golden parachute when he retires later this year. Not its customers, aka airlines \u2014 and that\u2019s by design. People often call Boeing and Airbus a duopoly, but that suggests there\u2019s some kind of legit competition happening. Once an airline commits to a tribe, it can\u2019t just switch if it decides the other one is making better planes, because that\u2019d involve a ton of money and time retraining staff who tend to specialize in one or the other. And naturally, we the flying public can cry all we want and it won\u2019t matter a lick to Boeing, because we have even less choice than the airlines to pick the aircraft we fly. Until recently, the government had also been largely snoozing. Calhoun was supposed to be overseeing efforts to reform a safety culture that was so broken, Boeing has acknowledged its lapses led to the deaths of 346 people in two separate crashes in 2018 and 2019. It wasn\u2019t until January 5 this year, when a Boeing jet\u2019s door plug blew off shortly after takeoff, that regulators and lawmakers appeared to snap to attention. Tuesday marked the first time ever that Calhoun has had to testify before lawmakers. He faced an intense grilling, fielding one biting question after the next from both Republican and Democratic senators. Calhoun mostly said the right things: He apologized to families of victims of two 737 Max crashes that took place before he became CEO. In the understatement of the century, he said Boeing is \u201cfar from perfect.\u201d And he acknowledged that the company has a lot of work to do to regain public trust. But when pressed on taking personal responsibility, Calhoun deflected, over and over. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley came in hot, pressing Calhoun about Boeing\u2019s abysmal financial performance, the fact that he got a 45% raise just last year while Boeing\u2019s machinists got 1% over eight years, and why he hasn\u2019t just resigned already. (Calhoun, who announced in the spring that he would retire at the end of 2024, responded that he\u2019s \u201csticking this through.\u201d In one of the more head-scratching moments, Calhoun actually defended Boeing\u2019s culture, saying he was proud of the company\u2019s safety record. \u201cI am proud of every action we have taken,\u201d Calhoun said when pressed by Hawley on how he could possibly be proud of Boeing\u2019s safety culture. Calhoun at one point said, \u201cI believe strongly in accountability.\u201d And yet he was repeatedly unable to provide Senators answers about company policies and actions, including how many whistleblowers it fired and whether the company held any individuals responsible for safety lapses. Near the end of the two-hour hearing, Hawley accused Calhoun of trying to shift blame to Boeing\u2019s employees. \u201cI don\u2019t think the problem\u2019s with the employees, actually, I think the problem\u2019s with you. It\u2019s the C-suite, it\u2019s the management, it\u2019s what you\u2019ve done to this company,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cYour engineers, they\u2019re probably the best in the world, your machinists, they\u2019re outstanding. You\u2019re the problem. And I just hope to God that you don\u2019t destroy this company before it can be saved.\u201d Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal didn\u2019t hold back, either, calling the hearing \u201ca moment of reckoning for Boeing.\u201d \u201cI think that you\u2019ve certainly demonstrated that you can talk about these changes,\u201d Blumenthal told Calhoun. \u201cBut making the changes may well require a different team.\u201d Calhoun may not have been accepting personal responsibility Tuesday, but the government may get the last word, anyway: The Federal Aviation Administration is reviewing Boeing\u2019s recently submitted plans to fix its safety problems. And the Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into the Jan. 5 incident. Tuesday\u2019s hearing put some well deserved fire under Calhoun\u2019s feet. But it seems unlikely that he\u2019ll shoulder any real responsibility for the mess he\u2019s made and the messes he failed to clean up. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what will change as a consequence of this,\u201d Richard Aboulafia, managing partner for AeroDynamic Consultancy, an aerospace advisory firm, told my colleague Chris Isidore. \u201c[Calhoun] needs to go.\u201d Aboulafia said. \u201cHe has shown a strong desire to double down on what\u2019s bad.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/business/boeings-ceo-responsible/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_21_business_trump-media-stock-truth-social-djt", "text": "Truth Social owner Trump Media & Technology Group has gone ice-cold. The conservative social media company has lost roughly half its market value since May 30, the day former President Donald Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts in a hush money trial. Trump Media\u2019s volatile share price (DJT) tumbled another 5% on Friday , leaving it down by a staggering 50% in the span of just three weeks. The severe selloff has erased nearly $3 billion from the estimated net worth of Trump, the controversial company\u2019s leading shareholder and chairman. The weeks-long selloff accelerated in recent days as Trump Media announced it received approval from regulators for a move that threatens to water down the holdings of shareholders. Despite the tumbling share price, some experts are warning Trump Media remains vulnerable to further losses. \u201cThe stock is still wildly overpriced,\u201d said Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida who has studied capital markets for the past four decades. The problem is that even after the recent selloff, Trump Media is still valued in the billions of dollars, and yet it generates very little revenue. Trump Media recorded revenue of just $770,500 in the first quarter, the second-straight quarter of sub-$1 million revenue. Not only that, but Truth Social remains a tiny player in social media, dwarfed by Elon Musk\u2019s X (formerly Twitter), Reddit and even Instagram\u2019s Threads. \u201cThis is a development-stage company with a multi-billion-dollar valuation,\u201d said Matthew Kennedy, senior IPO market strategist at Renaissance Capital. That\u2019s why some experts have dismissed Trump Media as a meme stock similar to GameStop and AMC that trades on momentum and hype, not fundamentals. \u201cWhen a company\u2019s stock drops significantly, you typically start to see value investors take interest, but that\u2019s not the case with meme stocks,\u201d said Kennedy. Trump Media was already having a bad June, and then it got even worse when the company announced the Securities and Exchange Commission approved its registration statement. The green light from regulators clears the way for early investors to exercise warrants they hold in the company to buy more shares. The move was long-expected, and it could raise nearly $250 million for Trump Media \u2014 cash the company can use to build its nascent ad platform or buy a smaller firm. \u201cToday marks another milestone for Truth Social,\u201d Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cWith our S-1 declared effective, we\u2019re expecting to be well positioned to energetically pursue TV streaming, other enhancements to the platform, and potential mergers and acquisitions.\u201d However, the exercising of the warrants will also likely dilute the holdings of existing shareholders by dramatically increasing the supply of shares outstanding in the company. Trump Media can issue 21.5 million additional shares. \u201cThe price of these meme stocks is determined by supply and demand \u2013 something that is true for any stock but more so for when a stock is trading so far above its fundamental value,\u201d said Ritter, the finance professor. Trump is the dominant shareholder in the company, owning 114.75 million shares, or nearly 65%. His stake was bumped up in late April when a bonus, known as earnout shares, was triggered by the company\u2019s share price staying above certain levels. Trump\u2019s stake, which can\u2019t be sold in the near-term, is now valued at about $3.1 billion. That\u2019s down from $6 billion as recently as May 30.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/business/trump-media-stock-truth-social-djt/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_business_uk-millionaires-loss-record", "text": "A record number of millionaires could leave the United Kingdom this year as political turmoil and the potential for higher taxes under a future Labour government reduce the appeal of what was once among the top destinations for the rich. As many as 9,500 people with at least $1 million in liquid, investable assets, will leave the country, more than double the number that left in 2023, according to provisional estimates contained in a report Tuesday by migration advisers Henley & Partners. \u201cThese figures reflect a steady accumulation of factors detracting from the UK\u2019s appeal to high-net-worth individuals,\u201d Hannah White, CEO of the Institute for Government, wrote in the report. \u201cThe hangover from Brexit continues to be felt, with the City of London no longer seen as the financial center of the world.\u201d The report is based on data on 150,000 high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) tracked by investment firm New World Wealth. The firm only counts people who stay in their new country more than half of the year, and focuses primarily on company founders, chairs, CEOs, presidents, directors and managing partners. The continuing exodus from the UK \u2014 16,500 millionaires left between 2017 and 2023 \u2014 is part of a global mass migration of the rich that appears to be accelerating. The Henley Private Wealth Migration report found that 128,000 millionaires are set to relocate this year, beating last year\u2019s record by 8,000. \u201cAs the world grapples with a perfect storm of geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainty and social upheaval, millionaires are voting with their feet in record numbers,\u201d Dominic Volek, head of private clients at Henley & Partners, said in a press release. Of the 15 places with most resident millionaires, the UK is suffering more than most \u2014 only China will lose more HNWIs (15,200) in 2024 \u2014 and it\u2019s one of just three locations, alongside Japan and Hong Kong, to have seen a net loss in the decade since 2013, according to the report. By contrast, the ranks of the wealthy have grown in the US, Canada, Australia, Germany and France over the same period. The impact of Brexit, which ended the free movement of people between the UK and the European Union as well as raising new barriers to trade and investment, and other economic shocks such as the war in Ukraine and the ensuing energy price spike, has been compounded by a period of unprecedented political uncertainty. The UK has had five prime ministers since 2010, including the 45-day tenure of Liz Truss in 2022, when her plan to jack up government borrowing to slash taxes sent the pound crashing to a record low against the dollar and forced the Bank of England to intervene to prevent a financial crisis. Such instability has made it much harder for policymakers to address the country\u2019s anemic economic growth and foster a better climate for investment. Now there\u2019s a new risk on the horizon. Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour Party, which is leading Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s Conservatives by a margin of about 20% in opinion polls, has gone out of its way to woo business and investors, and to promise economic stability and stronger growth if it wins the upcoming election on July 4. Starmer and his finance spokesperson Rachel Reeves, who previously worked at the Bank of England, have promised not to increase income tax or sales tax \u2014 and to stick with fiscal rules adopted by Sunak\u2019s government. But Labour is committed to targeted tax increases that could hit the rich. It wants to remove a 20% tax break from private schools to fund new teachers in the state sector, close remaining loopholes that allow so-called non-dom residents to protect some of their foreign earnings from tax and raise more money from private equity firms. \u201cThe outflow of high-net-worth individuals already generated by the economic and political context is now being accelerated by policy decisions ahead of the election,\u201d said White. Still, one very rich couple will apparently be staying, whatever the result on July 4. Sunak, a millionaire former hedge fund manager, and his wife Akshata Murty \u2014 the daughter of an Indian tech billionaire \u2014 are worth \u00a3651 million ($826 million), according to The Sunday Times Rich List, making them richer than King Charles. Sunak said last week he would serve a full term if re-elected as member of parliament in his northern England constituency, even if his party is kicked out of government.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/business/uk-millionaires-loss-record/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_business_alaska-airlines-labor-deal-flight-attendants", "text": "Alaska Airlines and its 7,000-member flight attendants union reached a tentative labor deal late Friday, concluding talks that lasted more than a year and a half. Terms of the deal have not been released, though the union called it a \u201crecord contract.\u201d The deal likely contains a significant pay raise, which has been a common demand across the airline industry and sought by unions whose members in some cases have not seen a pay increase in years. In April, the union announced to members it was seeking pay raises of between 43% to 56%, depending upon seniority, through 2026. Those pay raises would include back pay covering a period dating back a year and a half that they\u2019ve worked under the terms of the previous contract. \u201cYour actions over the last two years of bargaining \u2026 ensured we had the leverage to extract every last dollar from Alaska Airlines management,\u201d the union said Friday in a statement to its members. Alaska Airlines said it was pleased to have reached an agreement and thanked union negotiators. \u201cWith our combined efforts, we\u2019ve been able to reach an agreement that provides quality of life and continued career growth at Alaska,\u201d the airline said in a statement. The agreement still needs the approval of union leadership and rank-and-file members to go into effect. In February, rank-and-file members voted 99.5% in favor of authorizing a strike. However, under the Railway Labor Act, the labor law that covers airline workers, its members could not go on strike, even though their contract had reached its scheduled end date in December 2022. Instead, the union members continued to work under the terms and pay dictated by that contract. Such restrictions on striking don\u2019t exist for most private sector employees. In February, flight attendants from Alaska \u2014 along with American, United and Southwest \u2014held unprecedented coordinated pickets demanding new contracts. Since then, flight attendants at Southwest reached a deal that included an immediate 22.3% raise as of May 1 and $364 million in retroactive wages. Meanwhile, flight attendants at American and United are still seeking new deals. American flight attendants have asked to be released from restrictions so they can go on strike, but even if that is granted there would be months of cooling off periods before they could walk out, under the Railway Labor Act. Steve Maller, a flight attendant for nearly 20 years, was among those on the picket lines in February. Maller was one of the flight attendants on the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282, which drew international attention on January 5 when a door plug blew off, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Maller told CNN in February that he and the other members of the flight crew were commended by Alaska Airlines\u2019 top management for their actions in the plane, which landed without serious injuries. But he said he picketed because the existing contract did not provide a livable wage for too many flight attendants. Maller said he has worked at times as a bartender and that most flight attendants he knows also have second jobs. \u201cYou have to have something to have livable pay, to make ends meet,\u201d he said. Maller said he\u2019s also worried the airline is losing too many veteran flight attendants who have gone years with little or now wage increase. \u201cIt was unheard of five years ago (for flight attendants to) quit their jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have 20, 25, 30 a month (quitting).\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/business/alaska-airlines-labor-deal-flight-attendants/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_21_economy_us-homes-prices-record-high", "text": "Homes in America are the most expensive they\u2019ve ever been, according to one measure. The median price of a previously owned US home climbed for the eleventh consecutive month in May, up 5.8% from a year ago, to $419,300, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. That\u2019s the highest price ever recorded by NAR. \u201cHome prices reaching new highs are creating a wider divide between those owning properties and those who wish to be first-time buyers,\u201d NAR\u2019s chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a release. \u201cStill, first-time buyers in the market understand the long-term benefits of owning.\u201d Housing affordability remains in the gutter: In addition to sky-high home prices, mortgage rates are still higher than anything seen in the decade before 2022. There still aren\u2019t enough homes in the market to keep up with demand, despite some improvements in recent months. The situation could improve somewhat later this year, when the Federal Reserve is expected to begin paring back interest rates from a 23-year high, which should bring down mortgage rates. But Fed officials have penciled in just one rate cut for this year, and the days of ultra-low interest rates are long gone. Economists don\u2019t expect the average mortgage rate to fall below 6% in 2024. Recent research from Zillow shows that in order for a median-income household to afford a monthly mortgage payment on the typical US home, it would need to save up more than $127,000 for a down payment. That\u2019s roughly double the median salary of a US worker. Potential homebuyers are indeed facing a tough market, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be deterring some: Sales of previously owned homes in the US are up from the decades lows in the fall and only edged lower by 0.7% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.11 million. What\u2019s going on with housing supply? When supply doesn\u2019t keep up with demand, it pushes up prices. That\u2019s been the case in the US housing market for decades now. However, there have been some steps in the right direction: Total housing inventory has steadily increased throughout this year, according to NAR data. Inventory at the end of May stood at 1.28 million units, 6.7% higher from April and up 18.5% from a year ago. Homeowners who locked in a low rate before the\u00a0Fed\u00a0began to hike in 2022 have been unwilling or unable to sell their homes because of months of elevated mortgage\u00a0rates. But the recent growth in inventory may mean that homeowners are finally parting with their homes out of necessity because of life events such as marriage, divorce or new children, NAR\u2019s Yun has said. New home construction also contributes to housing supply, but high interest rates seem to have pumped the brakes on homebuilding. Housing starts fell in May to their lowest level since 2020, according to government statistics released Thursday, dropping by 5.5% from April. Building permits, seen as a forward indicator of future construction, came in below economists\u2019 expectations.

{"id": "2024_06_22_business_ups-delivery-vans-air-conditioning", "text": "This was supposed to be the year that air conditioning came to UPS delivery vans. It hasn\u2019t worked out that way. Despite a promise in the contract reached with the Teamsters union last year, UPS has not yet purchased any new vans with AC, even as temperatures soar across the country and the dangers of extreme heat put workers in harms way in and out of doors. Almost none of the nearly 100,000 brown package vans have AC. Temperatures inside the trucks, both the cab and especially the cargo space where drivers need to go to fetch and drop off packages, can regularly get well over 120 degrees, according to the Teamsters union, which represents more than 300,000 UPS employees. The union\u2019s demand for relief from the heat for its nearly 100,000 members working as delivery drivers was a major sticking point in contract negotiations last year between the union and the package delivery giant.\u00a0It was far more than an issue of comfort; it was a worker safety issue, according to the union. Drivers have been known to suffer heatstroke, with some coming close to death, while on the job in the vans. And as part of the contract reached in late July of last year, UPS agreed that all vans purchased after January 1 would include air conditioning. UPS also agreed to retrofit existing vans with fans in the cab, heat shields under the cargo area and what are known as \u201cscoop air intakes\u201d in the cargo area. The fans have been installed in all the vans, UPS said. About two thirds have been retrofitted with the heat shields and air scoops, reducing the temperature in the rear cargo by about 17 degrees on average, according to the company. But there have been no vans purchased this year, so no additional AC vans are on the roads. The company said van purchase decisions are based on package volume and the need to replace existing fleet, and there has been no need to make purchases so far. The Teamsters are not pleased by the lack of progress on the AC. \u201cWe are midway\u00a0into the summer, and frankly UPS is not moving fast enough,\u201d said the union in a statement to CNN. \u201cWe are aware that UPS has installed all contractually required second fans, and UPS is ahead of schedule in the installation of heat shields and air induction scoops for package compartment ventilation. But it\u2019s not enough.\u201d There are a small number of vans \u2013 in the hundreds \u2013 that have AC. Those are electric vans, or specialized vans for rural area that can go on gravel roads, UPS said. But they make up only a small fraction of the 94,000 UPS package vans on American roads. The number of vans with AC was bound to grow slowly. Some vans can last for more than 15 years. Retrofitting the existing fleet was going to bring more immediate relief. UPS told CNN it is very concerned with workers\u2019 safety and that AC was never going to be key to its heat mitigation efforts. In addition to the heat shield and air scoops, it has installed an additional 1,500 ice machines and 1,700 water fountains in its facilities. It said it also provided specialized cooling gear for UPS drivers and inside staff\u00a0to wear, as well as water jugs for drivers. And for inside workers it has installed additional fans in its buildings\u00a0and will install more. But AC is still a rarity in the UPS vans on the road.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/business/ups-delivery-vans-air-conditioning/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_business_china-local-government-tax-crackdown-intl-hnk", "text": "Authorities in cash-strapped Chinese cities are chasing companies for taxes dating back years, and in some cases decades, as they try to plug a hole blown in their finances by the real estate crisis. At least eight major listed companies in China have disclosed that they\u2019ve received demands to pay historical taxes, in one case going as far back as the 1990s, in a development that has caused an uproar online and damaged already fragile business confidence. V V Food & Beverage, the country\u2019s largest soy milk producer, said last week that one of its subsidiaries had received a demand for payment totaling 85 million yuan ($11.7 million) from the government of Zhijiang city in the central province of Hubei. The Zhijiang tax bureau said it recently found that the company had failed to file tax returns for 16 years from 1994 to 2009, the company said in a June 12 statement. The beverage maker isn\u2019t the only one to fall foul of the apparent tax crackdown. At least seven other listed companies have reported similar demands over the past few months. In some cases, the companies have had to suspend production and lay off workers because they couldn\u2019t absorb the hefty tax bills and penalties. The crackdown suggests local governments are searching for another way to fill their coffers, as they struggle under mounting financial stress because of a persistent property slump and economic weakness. The authorities have also publicized efforts to work more closely with police to find tax offenders, which has caused even more alarm. \u201cLocal governments in China are facing intense pressure to meet revenue targets, especially amidst economic slowdowns and broader fiscal challenges,\u201d said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the non-partisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Regional governments have long relied on land sales as a major source of revenue, which are used to pay for everything from roads to healthcare. But a real estate crisis since 2021 has diminished that source of funding. Over the past year, local governments have turned to extraordinary measures to raise cash or cut spending, including fining restaurants for serving shredded cucumber on noodles without a license or cutting fuel subsidies in the middle of winter. An \u2018extreme\u2019 response After the tax crackdown went viral on social media, the State Administration of Taxation issued a statement Tuesday, trying to calm nerves. It acknowledged that some tax authorities had been inspecting companies for potential misconduct but denied that it had launched \u201cany nationwide, industry-specific or centralized tax inspections.\u201d  \u201cWe fully understand the concerns of the business community and the public, \u201c it added. The admission has whipped up speculation online this week that the establishment of \u201cPolice & Taxation Joint Combat Centers\u201d in some parts of the country will result in much more aggressive taxation policies to come. The centers, which enable local police and taxation authorities to share intelligence and manpower, were first trialed in the city of Yichun in the southeastern province of Jiangxi in 2021. And the central government\u2019s attempt to reassure has jarred with the local crackdowns, causing confusion and fear. Investigating possible back taxes from 20 or 30 years ago seems \u201cextreme,\u201d said Frank Tian Xie, a professor at the University of South Carolina Aiken. \u201cIf those companies indeed owed taxes before, why didn\u2019t the authority go after them right away? \u2026 Why isn\u2019t it the government\u2019s negligence in tax collection that resulted in this fiasco?\u201d he said. The resulting payments, including the unpaid tax, fines and interest could be \u201cexorbitant\u201d and lead to bankruptcies of many companies, he warned. The crackdown poses \u201csevere risks to businesses already strained by operational challenges and external economic pressures,\u201d Singleton said. \u201cThis could ripple through the economy, potentially exacerbating job losses and dampening investor confidence.\u201d Beijing has been trying to reassure the private sector over the past year. Such businesses have become increasingly reluctant to borrow or invest, after years of regulatory crackdowns and stringent Covid restrictions battered their confidence. Profits hit So far, the targets of the probes have been privately owned businesses in a variety of industries. V V has warned that its bottomline could take a hit. Last year, the soy milk seller made a net profit of only 209 million yuan ($29 million). And it\u2019s still unsure how much it owes in fines, which could be potentially higher than the actual $11.7 million tax bill. Last Wednesday, Ningbo Bohui Chemical Technology, a producer of additives and light fuel oil, said\u00a0it had to suspend production because of \u201coperating cash difficulties.\u201d The cash crunch was revealed shortly after the Ningbo government asked the company to pay taxes for one of its products sold between July 2023 and March 2024. The company said that would \u201caffect\u201d its net profits by about 500 million yuan ($69 million). The tax bureau later said the levy was imposed after a national rule was updated last year. The company said it shouldn\u2019t have been subjected to the tax. \u201cIt [the new taxes] will have a significant adverse impact on the company\u2019s 2023 performance and future production and operations,\u201d Bohui said in a statement in March. \u201cThe company will swing from profits to big losses in 2023.\u201d Zangge Mining, a producer of potassium chloride in the western province of Qinghai, said in April that it had received a demand from the Golmud city government to pay back taxes from 2019 to 2023. Including fines, the company needed to pay a total amount of 480 million yuan ($66 million). Chongqing-based PKU Healthcare, Shanghai-based Shunho New Materials, Shenzhen-based ChinaLin Securities, and Yunan-based Yixintang Pharmaceutical Group have also paid tax bills to local governments going as far back as seven years, according to separate statements made in March and April. The amounts paid vary from 8 million yuan ($1.1 million) to 310 million yuan ($43 million). The first company to report on the trend this year was LianTronics, a major LED display manufacturer. It said in January that the Shenzhen government had asked for payment of 19.8 million yuan ($2.7 million) in back taxes for 2017 and 20.2 million yuan ($2.8 million) in fines.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/business/china-local-government-tax-crackdown-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "business"}}
