{"id": "2024_05_16_business_china-property-crisis-unsold-homes-hnk-intl", "text": "Chinese stocks surged on Thursday after officials in a major city announced plans to buy unsold homes in what some analysts believe could be a trial run for a much bigger solution to the country\u2019s property crisis. Hong Kong\u2019s benchmark Hang Seng Index closed up 1.6%, hitting its highest level since August. The index has rallied nearly 30% from its January low, having entered a bull market earlier this month. Property developers, which were up 3.1% on average, led the way. Longfor Group, the ninth largest homebuilder in China, surged 11%, becoming the top performing stock on the Hang Seng Index.\u00a0Sunshine 100 China Holdings, a Beijing-based developer, soared 127%, the best performer on the broader market. The rally comes after a district in the megacity of Hangzhou announced that the government would directly purchase unsold residential homes from the market and convert them into affordable housing. The announcement reinforced expectations that the Chinese government is considering a proposal to have local governments across the country buy millions of unsold homes, dubbed a \u201cmajor solution\u201d by Chinese media for the crisis-ridden property sector. Adding to the expectations, the National Development and Reform Commission, the country\u2019s top economic planner, pledged on Thursday to \u201cpromote affordable housing\u201d and explore \u201ca new model\u201d for the real estate sector. \u201cWe think this is a largely symbolic move to show support for the sector with a \u2018national team\u2019 for the housing market,\u201d said Citi analysts. Speculation about just such a bailout has been rife since last month, when a Chinese media outlet reported that Beijing was learning from Japan\u2019s experience of decades of stagnation and considering a plan to acquire unfinished housing units across the country. These units would then be\u00a0turned into low-cost housing and would be sold or rented out. \u201c[The proposal is] a much bigger support measure\u00a0than the current pilot initiatives across the country, and one that is helping ease the negative spillover [for stocks] from fresh US tariffs on\u00a0Chinese exports,\u201d said analysts from ING Group. But fund managers are more cautious. \u201cWe are cautiously optimistic about the \u2018government-led buying on unsold units\u2019 as it\u2019s still being rolled out in more cities, \u201c said Jeff Zhang, an equity analyst at Morningstar. \u201cFunding issue could remain a key concern.\u201d Beijing has struggled to contain the country\u2019s prolonged property crisis, which has become a major drag on the economy and sparked nationwide protests by homebuyers. Many big cities have relaxed home-purchase restrictions over the past few weeks, including Hangzhou, Xi\u2019an and Chengdu. At the end of last month, the Politburo, the top decision-making body of China\u2019s Communist Party, vowed to explore new measures to tackle the housing crisis, including implementing \u201ccity-specific\u201d policies to reduce housing inventory. Investors have been steadily pouring money back into Chinese shares since last month. The rebound follows a prolonged sell-off that sent key indexes in Hong Kong and Shanghai to their lowest levels in years, wiping trillions off the value of listed companies. Nasdaq Golden China Index, which tracks Chinese companies listed on Wall Street, has gained 11% since the start of April. It hit the highest level in more than seven months on Monday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/business/china-property-crisis-unsold-homes-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

Federal prosecutors in Manhattan called the scheme perpetrated by Anton Peraire-Bueno, 24, and James Peraire-Bueno, 28, \u201cnovel\u201d and said the case marked the first time that such a fraud had ever been the subject of U.S. criminal\u00a0charges. Authorities said they executed their elaborate heist in April 2023, stealing $25 million from traders in just 12 seconds by fraudulently gaining access to pending transactions and altering the movement of cryptocurrency. \u201cAs we allege, the defendants\u2019 scheme calls the very integrity of the blockchain into question,\u201d U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said. An\u00a0indictment\u00a0charged them with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Anton Peraire-Bueno was arrested in Boston, while James Peraire-Bueno was arrested in New York. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Both\u00a0brothers\u00a0had attended Cambridge, Massachusetts-based MIT, where according to prosecutors they studied computer science and math and developed the skills and education they relied upon to carry out their fraud. The indictment alleged that for months, the Peraire-Bueno\u00a0brothers\u00a0plotted to manipulate and tamper with the protocols used to validate transactions for inclusion on the Ethereum blockchain, a public ledger that records each cryptocurrency transaction. Prosecutors said they did so by exploiting a vulnerability in the code of software called MEV-boost that is used by most Ethereum network \u201cvalidators,\u201d who are responsible for checking that new transactions are valid before they are added to the blockchain. Prosecutors said that after carrying out the heist, the\u00a0brothers\u00a0rejected requests to return the funds and instead took steps to launder and hide the stolen cryptocurrency.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/investing/mit-crypto-hack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_14_business_meme-stocks-gamestop-trump-media-nightcap", "text": "We in the financial press tend to talk about the meme stock revolution (or craze, or frenzy, or mass delusion) in the past tense. It was a 2021 phenomenon \u2014 the climax of a zero-interest rate-fueled euphoria that pit Robinhood hobbyists against Wall Street\u2019s elite, a financial David vs. Goliath, etc. If you can\u2019t remember how the whole thing ended, that\u2019s partly because it never really did. And now the ride-or-die diamond-handed GameStop crowd is trying to get the band back together. See here: On Monday, after three years out of silence, one of the orchestrators of the 2021 GameStop surge roared back into the spotlight with a wordless meme on X that his followers interpreted as a rally cry for the stock he put on the map. The account is linked to Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty, aka DeepF\u2014ingValue. From that single, cryptic post depicting a man sitting in an office chair \u2014 a meme that suggests\u00a0\u201cwhen things get serious\u201d \u2014 GameStop (GME) shares soared more than 100% before being halted for volatility. The stock ended Monday up more than 70%, rising $13 to $30.45 a share. On Tuesday, the meme-ing continued, as GameStop rose another 70%. AMC, another meme investor favorite, rose 85%. Tupperware surged 35% and BlackBerry \u2014 yes, you can still trade BlackBerry \u2014 was up 13%. Beyond Meat, a former Wall Street darling that\u2019s been struggling with waning demand for its plant-based burgers, was up 27%. \u201cNo fundamental investors are involved in this,\u201d Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told me. \u201cThe fundamentals didn\u2019t make sense at $9 a share, they don\u2019t make sense at $30 a share. But for those who\u2019ve been awaiting the next signal, it arrived.\u201d Why now While we don\u2019t know why Gill, who didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment, chose to emerge from the shadows this week, it\u2019s clear the timing was ripe for another surge. Another meme stock, Trump Media and Technology Group, the Donald Trump-owned media company that controls Truth Social, brought back memories of the 2021 GameStop bonanza. Then, a team of amateurs on Reddit collectively stuck it to the man by squeezing traders who had short interest (bets that the stock would fall) on GameStop, AMC (AMC), Bed Bath & Beyond and others. With Trump Media, Trump supporters and other speculative traders pumped up the stock not for its (extraordinarily lousy) fundamentals, but more as a vote of support for the former president\u2019s campaign and even a barometer of his winning chances. The stock, which has surged nearly 200% this year, has been extremely volatile, rising and falling rapidly depending on the whims of the day. Back in 2021, the meme stock emerged for the first time out of a collision of macro forces: An unprecedented mix of pandemic-era cheap money, boredom, social media, and the widespread adoption of free trading apps to dabble in equity markets. We\u2019re not quite as exuberant today as we were then, but we\u2019re still within spitting distance of all-time highs on major stock indices, Sosnick notes. In some ways, the arrival in the spring of Donald Trump\u2019s media company reawakened the meme stock monster. \u201cIf I were Roaring Kitty in the crowd, seeing what happened to DJT,\u201d Sosnick says, \u201cit may have made a lot of them think, \u2018Oh wait, maybe we can get the band back together.\u201d The water is warm, and day traders may be spoiling for a fight, especially if they\u2019re among the legion who caught the 2021 wave too late. Michael Pachter, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, told me that the difference between the 2021 craze and now is that the David of the story no longer has a Goliath like Melvin Capital, Gabe Plotkin\u2019s hedge fund, which ran itself into the ground shorting GameStop. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the people who are short the stock are as adamant\u201d as Plotkin, who \u201chad more conviction than money,\u201d according to Pachter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/business/meme-stocks-gamestop-trump-media-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

Berkshire revealed it acquired nearly 26 million shares of Chubb in a Wednesday Securities and Exchange Commission filing of the company\u2019s first quarter investments. That translates to a value of approximately $6.7 billion. Buffett\u2019s company had shielded the position from public knowledge as it was building the stake, requesting \u201cconfidential treatment\u201d from the SEC in previous filings. Chubb, an insurance business that operates in 54 countries, made headlines in March after the company underwrote President Donald Trump\u2019s nearly $92 million appeal bond in E.

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Microsoft asked as many as 800 employees \u2014 mostly engineers with Chinese nationality working on cloud computing and AI \u2014 to consider relocating.

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

The UAW is hoping to carry its strong momentum right now, as its decision to use a \u201cstand up strike\u201d strategy hitting the Big Three automakers all at once brought unprecedented attention and record contracts for workers. And last month, it won a union election at a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, its first victory in three attempts to organize the factory. Winning the Alabama vote would mean the UAW\u2019s biggest push to grow its membership in decades will keep going. The UAW watched for decades as non-unionized factories owned by companies from Kia to Toyota to Tesla to Rivian popped up across the country, especially in the southern United States. But under relatively new UAW president Shawn Fain, the strategy has changed. In an interview with Car and Driver, Fain said the profit margins for the Japanese, Korean and German automakers were \u201cobscenely more gross than they were at the Big Three, and yet their workers get less.\u201d \u201cI truly believe we\u2019re going to see a huge shift this year. I think we\u2019re gonna win in the South,\u201d he said in the interview. But a loss could stall those efforts \u2014 and reaffirm the South\u2019s reputation as a union-free, corporate-friendly region. In November 2023, the UAW said it began an effort to organize workers at 13 non-union auto US factories. The effort included three US-based electric vehicle makers \u2014 Tesla, Rivian and Lucid \u2014 as well as 10 foreign automakers that build cars in the US \u2014 BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Mercedes, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Volvo. The Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance, Alabama, near Tuscaloosa, has about 6,000 hourly workers. Voting is set to end Friday morning. Mercedes\u2019 response In a statement, Mercedes-Benz US International said it \u201cfully respects our Team Members\u2019 choice whether to unionize and we look forward to participating in the election process to ensure every Team Member has a chance to cast their own secret-ballot vote, as well as having access to the information necessary to make an informed choice.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean Mercedes would let its workers unionize without putting up a fight, as the company has used language and tactics common to corporations that are resistant to organizing efforts. \u201cWe believe open and direct communication with our Team Members is the best path forward to ensure continued success,\u201d the statement said. In a separate statement, MBUSI said that it \u201chas a proven record of competitively compensating Team Members and providing many additional benefits.\u201d And the company is allegedly pushing back against unionization efforts in other ways, according to six unfair labor practice charges filed by the UAW. The National Labor Relations Board said it is investigating six unfair labor practice charges filed by the UAW against Mercedes-Benz since March. Those charges allege Mercedes has disciplined employees for discussing unionization during work, prohibited distribution of union materials, surveilled employees, and forced employees to attend \u201ccaptive audience meetings,\u201d which is a mandatory meeting during work meant to discourage unionizing. Mercedes-Benz US International denied these claims, and said in a statement it \u201chas not interfered with or retaliated against any Team Member in their right to pursue union representation.\u201d It continued, \u201cWe do not believe these claims have merit and we look forward to presenting our case to the NLRB.\u201d Building off momentum Last month, hourly workers at Volkswagen\u2019s plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, overwhelmingly voted to join the UAW \u2014 73% of the 3,600 workers at the plant who cast ballots had voted to join the union. The victory didn\u2019t come easy for the UAW. Volkswagen didn\u2019t win until its third union drive, said Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at\u00a0Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations\u2019 Buffalo office. And this is the Mercedes plant\u2019s first strong push. \u201cIt\u2019s not a catastrophe if they don\u2019t win (the first time). Primarily because they\u2019re facing a very active Mercedes Benz trying to block them from organizing, you got governors in the South trying to block them from organizing, and they don\u2019t have the same track record or history or infrastructure in Alabama,\u201d Wheaton said. Even more broadly, unions have enjoyed a successful run \u2014 they won\u00a0pay increases of 10% or more\u00a0for nearly a million union members last year, according to an analysis by CNN.\u00a0Strikes\u00a0were at a decade high in 2023, and organizing activity also increased. \u201cLabor has something to bring to the table. You see the successes at the bargaining table. It makes people more aware that the union may have something to offer,\u201d Wheaton said. Why this election matters This election has huge implications for the UAW\u2019s organizing efforts beyond the Big Three unionized automakers \u2013 GM, Ford and Stellantis. The South has a much lower level of union representation than workers in industrial regions in the North. But a labor expert says a loss would not be the end of the UAW\u2019s efforts in organizing in the South. \u201cIt\u2019s not horrible if they lose, because it gives the UAW the chance to see where they\u2019re at. They can gauge how much support they have,\u201d Wheaton said. There are about 150,000 workers at nonunion auto plants in the United States today. That\u2019s roughly the same amount of workers represented at the Big Three. The UAW is at the point where more than a majority of autos that are sold in the US are assembled and produced in plants that don\u2019t have UAW representation, which weakens their bargaining power at the Big Three, Harry Katz, professor of collective bargaining at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations said. Since 1990, the South\u2019s share of auto jobs has doubled from around 15% to 30% today, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Meanwhile, the Midwest\u2019s share has declined from 60% to 45%. \u201cSo much of auto production is occurring in plants not represented by the UAW. The management then threatens to move production to those other sites,\u201d Katz said. A lot at stake Katz said a win would not be a bellwether event, and the consequences of the union losing the vote will be even greater than the positive outcome if they win, he said. \u201cIt would be an important victory, but it wouldn\u2019t signal that there\u2019s necessarily signs that unions are going to have a cakewalk, an easy path to winning in either the other transplants or in many other organizations,\u2019\u201d Katz said. Though a union win could generate momentum, it doesn\u2019t mean a victory will mean other plants can overcome management opposition at other foreign-owned plants. Non-union automakers have already begun their response to the big union victories thus far. Toyota, Honda and Hyundai all announced raises for their US factory workers within two weeks of tentative contract agreements with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. And workers at those plants might be content with the non-union status they\u2019ve worked under already. \u201cThose plants\u2019 management has a lot of communication engagement strategies that \u2013rightfully or not \u2013 seem to satisfy the worker,\u201d Katz said, who said those workers are already earning significantly more than their local labor markets. And there is pressure from local politicians as well. Six southern governors from Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas issued a joint statement in April discouraging the union campaign, warning it could put workers\u2019 jobs, as well as the auto industry in the South, in jeopardy. The statement came a day before workers at Volkswagen voted on joining the UAW. \u201cThe reality is companies have choices when it comes to where to invest and bring jobs and opportunity. We have worked tirelessly on behalf of our constituents to bring good-paying jobs to our states. These jobs have become part of the fabric of the automotive manufacturing industry,\u201d the statement said. CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore and Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this report.

But Walmart is growing as consumers search for inexpensive groceries, essentials and other merchandise. Walmart said Thursday that sales at stores open at least a year increased 3.8% during its latest quarter from the same time last year. The company raised its sales and profit guidance for the year, a sign it expects growth to continue. The largest retailer in the United States has used its size and buying power to keep prices lower than competitors even as inflation has surged since the pandemic, retail analysts say. Groceries account for more than half of Walmart\u2019s sales, and Walmart has benefited from its pricing advantage with prices around 25% lower than traditional supermarkets, according to analysts at Evercore IRI. While low and middle-income shoppers have traditionally formed the core of Walmart\u2019s customer base, Walmart also has grown with people making more than $100,000 a year, saying that its gains last quarter were \u201cprimarily driven by upper-income households.\u201d Walmart is also making gains online. Its digital sales, which include in-store pickup and delivery, grew 22% last quarter. \u201cMost Americans remain uncomfortable with food prices and are still actively looking for ways to keep their spending in check,\u201d Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients Thursday. This has worked in \u201cWalmart\u2019s favor and has allowed the chain to continue to acquire new customers.\u201d Walmart\u2019s stock jumped 7% during afternoon trading Thursday. Meanwhile, department stores, home improvement retailers and other retail segments have  taken a hit as stretched shoppers pull back. Fast food chains have also struggled.

Home Depot\u2019s sales at stores open for at least one year fell 2.8% last quarter, the company said this week, and some lower-income Americans are rejecting\u00a0McDonald\u2019s, opting to cook at home instead, according to McDonald\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenging consumer environment,\u201d said Ian Borden, McDonald\u2019s CFO, noting that many consumers are trying to manage inflation, higher interest rates and dwindling savings.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/investing/walmart-sales-inflation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

TAGeX Brands is conducting an online auction of Red Lobster restaurant inventory, including kitchen equipment, furniture, tables and chairs. The auction begins Monday and continues through Thursday, according to company founder Neal Sherman. Red Lobster locations in Buffalo, Orlando, Jacksonville and other cities were listed as \u201ctemporarily closed\u201d on Red Lobster\u2019s website, according to local news reports. Red Lobster did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. The company has around 650 locations. Red Lobster is\u00a0reportedly\u00a0considering filing for bankruptcy protection. The chain has tapped a restructuring expert as its chief executive, a possible indicator of an impending bankruptcy. The mass closures are another sign of problems at Red Lobster and one of the only times in its more than 50-year history the chain has closed dozens of stores at once. Red Lobster was a casual dining pioneer, bringing affordable seafood to middle-class consumers for the first time. But the chain has declined in recent years due to a range of factors, including corporate mismanagement, say former leaders and restaurant analysts. In 2020, Thai Union, a longtime supplier to Red Lobster, took an undisclosed financial stake in the chain, becoming a key shareholder. Under Thai Union\u2019s direction, Red Lobster has cycled through four CEOs and an all-you-can-eat shrimp deal last year that slowed down table service and cut into Thai Union\u2019s profitability.

Thai Union said earlier this year it would divest from Red Lobster and take a $530 million loss on its investment. \u201cI\u2019m going to stop eating lobster,\u201d Chansiri said. The explosive growth and popularity of fast-casual chains like Chipotle and quick-service chains like Chick-fil-A over the past two decades also squeezed Red Lobster and the casual dining sector. Casual dining has slipped from 36% of total restaurant industry sales in 2013 to 31% in 2023, according to Technomic, a restaurant research firm.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/business/red-lobster-is-abruptly-closing-dozens-of-restaurants/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_business_us-economy-stagflation-nightcap", "text": "When new gross domestic product figures last month showed US economic growth slowed from recent gangbuster levels, many people diagnosed the economy as having a really ugly sickness: stagflation. Symptoms of stagflation include (but are not limited to), stagnating economic growth combined with rising inflation. So March\u2019s ugly inflation report, which showed an unexpected jump in the pace of price increases, and the lackluster GDP report, made the diagnosis seem like a no-brainer. Even JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said last month the US economy \u201clooks more like the 1970s than we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d and that stagflation is a growing risk. But Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said any positive stagflation tests were false positives. \u201cI don\u2019t see the stag or the \u2018flation,\u201d he told reporters at a press conference earlier this month after Fed officials voted to leave interest rates unchanged. \u201cI was around for stagflation. It was 10% unemployment. It was high single-digits inflation and very slow growth,\u201d he added, referring to stagflation in the 1970s after a spike in oil prices during the Arab oil embargo. I, being a Gen Zer, can\u2019t speak to that period firsthand. But I agree with Powell nonetheless \u2014 the US economy is not experiencing stagflation. It may, however, be experiencing a different, far less serious condition: slackflation. What is slackflation? If you\u2019ve never heard that term before, there\u2019s a good reason \u2014 I just coined it myself.  Slackflation is a condition that\u2019s bothersome enough that you\u2019d text your mom about it and she\u2019d tell you to go to urgent care. Then, you ignore her advice and either it goes away on its own or it gets a lot worse. To use more economic lingo, slackflation is when inflation is sticky \u2014 but not out of control\u2014 and there\u2019s slack in the economy (nothing to do with the messaging app that has an incredible collection of emojis). Economic slack, a term I unfortunately cannot take any credit for, broadly describes a situation where the economy isn\u2019t performing as well as it could be. The most widely recognized symptom of economic slack is a rising unemployment rate. That\u2019s happening in the US per the latest jobs report. But it\u2019s not nearly at levels that would be cause for concern \u2014 the unemployment rate went up just a tenth of a percentage point in April to 3.9% from 3.8% in March. But that could change in the near future. One potentially worrisome sign is the pace of monthly job gains, which slowed to 175,000 last month from 315,000 in March. But many economists agree with Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, who referred to April\u2019s gains as \u201cvery solid.\u201d On top of that, applications for first-time unemployment benefits rose to the highest level since August last week. But on the inflation front, April Consumer Price Index data released Wednesday showed a tiny bit of improvement, with the pace of both annual and monthly price increases slowing slightly. Month-to-month movements in the nation\u2019s inflation rate aren\u2019t all that meaningful to Fed officials, though. As the adage in finance goes, the trend is your friend. And the trend with inflation is not really friendly right now. After months of big improvements, it\u2019s looking like progress may be stalling in getting to the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target. But, still, the inflation we\u2019re experiencing now is nothing compared to that seen in the 1970s and 1980s. So, what\u2019s up with all the stagflation chatter? Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, summed it up nicely to me. Unlike Powell, \u201cthe majority of the labor force wasn\u2019t born\u201d when stagflation was rampant in the US economy, and therefore \u201cthere is no muscle memory of it in their lifetimes.\u201d At the same time, millennials who dominate the workforce are \u201cunable to achieve a lot of other milestones that are very important to people.\u201d Chief among those, she said, is purchasing a home \u2014 which many Americans have delayed indefinitely with record-high home prices and painfully high mortgage rates. \u201cSo, no, it\u2019s not the 1970s, but it\u2019s understandable why people are still upset.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/business/us-economy-stagflation-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_business_china-us-companies-slow-economy-intl-hnk", "text": "For decades, Western companies made a fortune betting on the inexorable rise of the Chinese consumer. Now an economic slump and the emergence of ferocious local competitors means those bets look less safe as price wars erupt. Discounts and special deals are being offered across consumer brands from food and clothing to consumer electronics and cars, reflecting a dramatic shift in consumption patterns in the world\u2019s second largest economy. One of the most intense price wars is raging in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, where a \u201clife and death\u201d race has manufacturers scrambling for survival. Tesla\u2019s China market share shrank to 4% in April, almost halving from 7.7% in March, according to data released by the China Passenger Car Association on Friday. Deliveries from its Shanghai factory, its largest globally, fell 18% last month from a year earlier. The sharp drop contrasts with rising sales by its biggest Chinese rival BYD, which reported a 29% jump in pure EV deliveries. \u201cEveryone has changed the way they think about China,\u201d said Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder and managing principal at J Capital Research. \u201cThe business climate has changed entirely.\u201d Last month, Tesla (TSLA) announced aggressive price cuts in the country, shortly after also reducing prices in the United States and Germany. The move added to a\u00a0series of price reductions\u00a0that it has made in its biggest overseas market since late 2022. Last year, the Chinese economy grew 5.2%. Outside the pandemic years, that was its slowest pace of annual expansion since 1990, when gross domestic product increased only 3.9% because of international sanctions following the 1989\u00a0Tiananmen Square massacre. Consumers have curtailed spending as their job and income prospects worsened. A prolonged crisis in real estate, which accounts for 70% of household wealth, and a stock market meltdown have added to their woes. In the 1990s, \u201cevery company in the West\u201d was hiring consultants and having boardroom meetings about how to do more in China, according to Stevenson-Yang. But now the consultants are gone and rather than talking about how to tap into rapid growth, the C-suite discussions are all about \u201cgetting out, protecting one\u2019s operations or balancing supply among several countries.\u201d \u201cChina now is somewhere around the status of a Brazil \u2014 big, important but difficult,\u201d she added. The country\u2019s economic woes aren\u2019t confined to Tesla and the EV industry either. They\u2019re hitting other American corporate giants like Apple (AAPL), Starbucks (STUX) and McDonald\u2019s (MCD): all struggling to adjust their business strategies for a rapidly changing market. Discounted iPhones Worries about the future have forced Chinese consumers to be more budget-conscious, said Yang Wang, senior analyst for Counterpoint Research. As a result, purchases associated with premium or luxury have taken a back seat. \u201cCertainly Chinese consumers are experiencing \u2018downgraded consumption\u2019 in general,\u201d he said. Apple\u2019s overall revenue in Greater China \u2014 including mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao \u2014 fell 8% to $16.4 billion in the fiscal quarter ending March 30. Meanwhile, Huawei, a Chinese tech champion that the West once tried to kill off, has been advancing rapidly. Its smartphone sales soared 70% in the first quarter of 2024, boosted by the successful launch of its Mate 60 series, according to data compiled by Counterpoint Research. \u201c[China] is the most competitive market in the world,\u201d said Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, at an earnings call with analysts earlier this month. He added that he continues to feel optimistic about the Chinese market in the long term. The US smartphone maker has cut prices for iPhones sold in China, which helped its shipments jump in March, according to data published last week by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a government-backed research firm. It marked a turnaround from the previous two months of 2024, when Apple saw a deep slump in iPhone sales. The price reductions were led by Apple and third-party retailing platforms, with some iPhone 15 models offered at discounts of as much as 20%. Food fights Coffee chains have also scrambled to undercut each other\u2019s prices. Last February, Cotti Coffee, a startup founded by two former Luckin Coffee executives, began a campaign to slash latte prices to as low as 9.9 yuan ($1.4). The move prompted Luckin, which is the country\u2019s largest coffee chain, to match that price.\u00a0Cotti then slashed latte prices again to 8.8 yuan ($1.2). The aggressive discounts have affected global brands. Even Starbucks, which had signalled it had no interest in a price war in China, started offering coupons that effectively lowered its latte prices to below 20 yuan ($2.8). They normally sell for 30 yuan ($4.2). The average check paid by a Starbucks customer declined 9% in China in the first quarter of the year, mainly because of promotions and lower sales of higher priced merchandise, the company said. \u201cOur consumers are now more cautious in their spending,\u201d said Belinda Wong, chairwoman and co-CEO of Starbucks China, on an earnings call in January. \u201cYou see mass influx of mass market competitors focus on fast store expansion and low price tactics to drive trial.\u201d Fast food chains have also gotten into the act. \u201cPoor man\u2019s deal\u201d has become a trending term among Chinese youth since 2022. It initially referred to McDonald\u2019s \u201c1+1 = 13.9-yuan pair as you wish\u201d $1.90 set meal, which was extremely popular among customers. Other Western fast food chains have subsequently jumped on the bandwagon, launching their own low-price set meals. Online guides for getting weekly fast food discounts have gone viral on social media. \u201cMondays at McDonalds for free McNuggets, Tuesdays at Tastien for a \u2018one-for-one\u2019 offer, Wednesdays at Dominos for 30% off, Thursdays at KFC for the \u2018crazy Thursday\u2019 deal, Fridays at Burger King for a half-priced weekday set deal, then heading to Wallace for the weekends. Repeat next week,\u201d according to one guide. Nanchengxiang, a Beijing-based fast food chain, has even launched an ultra-cheap \u201c 3 yuan (41 cents) breakfast buffet,\u201d setting a record low price for all you can eat meals. The set, dubbed by many netizens as \u201ca must-have for poor people working in Beijing,\u201d has more than doubled sales during breakfast hours, according to canyin168, a data tracking and analytical website in the catering industry. \u2018No easy fix\u2019 The \u201cdepressed\u201d consumer sentiment is likely to stay for a while, said Yang from Counterpoint Research. Some Western brands \u201cinevitably\u201d will be forced to reconsider pricing to defend market share. However, that will be \u201cno easy fix,\u201d as foreign brands are at a disadvantage vis-a-vis domestic brands due to higher operating costs, he added. He doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re likely to pull out of the country though. Over the medium to long term, China is still set to drive global economic growth and contribute to the largest growing cohort of middle-class consumers. \u201cWith depressed economic prospects in most developed countries, and still some catching up to do for key emerging market growth markets like India, China could still offer the most lucrative market globally, even with depressed consumption levels,\u201d he said. But expectations will have to be lowered. \u201cI think the fundamental mistake that many Western companies made in China was\u00a0to believe in the myth of a rising middle class,\u201d said Stevenson-Yang. \u201cIn reality, Chinese people had a ton of money from capital gains in real estate and the stock market; They never had big increases in income. The economy is not reverting to the poverty levels of the 1980s, but there is a lot of dialing back being done.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/business/china-us-companies-slow-economy-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_business_biden-tariffs-trade-trump-tai", "text": "US Trade Representative Katherine Tai raised eyebrows this week by dismissing concerns that President Joe Biden\u2019s new tariffs on China would increase prices for US customers like the Trump-era tariffs on China did. \u201cFirst of all, I think that that link, in terms of tariffs to prices, has been largely debunked,\u201d Tai told reporters while speaking from the White House podium on Tuesday. But that claim has been met with skepticism from economists \u2014 and even Biden\u2019s own administration. Research shows that former President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on China did indeed raise prices on consumers and businesses \u2014 despite his claims otherwise. A person familiar with the matter told CNN on Wednesday that Tai \u201cmisspoke\u201d when she said the link between tariffs and prices has been debunked. Angela Perez, a spokesperson for the USTR, said Tai was trying to make the case that tariffs did not cause the inflation experienced during and after Covid-19. A\u00a02023 study\u00a0from the US International Trade Commission found that US importers \u201cbore nearly the full cost\u201d of the tariffs and costs largely did not get passed onto consumers. The study found tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump did not meaningfully contribute to inflation. Goldman Sachs told clients recently that the \u201c2018-2019 tariffs clearly raised consumer prices,\u201d adding that these price hikes were \u201cborne almost entirely by US businesses and households\u201d \u2014 not Chinese exporters. Worse, Goldman Sachs found that tariffs allowed US producers and non-Chinese exporters to the US market to \u201copportunistically raise their prices as well.\u201d Notably, Tai\u2019s boss previously warned that consumers pay for tariffs. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t get the basics,\u201d Biden said in a post on X in June 2019. \u201cHe thinks tariffs are being paid by China. Any freshman econ student could tell you that the American people are paying his tariffs.\u201d Tax Foundation economist Alex Durante told CNN he was \u201cmystified\u201d by Tai\u2019s \u201cwildly off-base\u201d comments. Maury Obstfeld, a former Obama official who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, similarly dismissed Tai\u2019s claim. \u201cPresident Biden got it right in his June 2019 tweet. Higher tariffs are\u00a0a tax that falls for the most part on Americans, not foreigners,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe new Biden tariffs, like the more extensive ones that Trump has promised, will worsen US inflation. Consumers will suffer, as will firms that rely on imported intermediate components.\u201d After her \u201clargely debunked\u201d comment, Tai went on to note that the \u201cinflationary dynamics\u201d linked to supply chain challenges were primarily related to Covid and also from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Of course, that point is not really in dispute. Instead, the debate typically focuses on how much corporate greed and federal stimulus contributed to price spikes, not tariffs. It is fair to debate how much the Biden tariffs will impact inflation because they are not nearly as widespread as what Trump imposed and what Trump is promising if he\u2019s reelected. During the White House briefing, Tai emphasized that the Biden administration\u2019s strategy is a \u201ctargeted strategic response that is meant to work together with the investments that we\u2019re making.\u201d Perez, the USTR spokesperson, added that these targeted tariffs \u201cwon\u2019t increase costs for the American people.\u201d \u201cBy using these tariffs strategically, we\u2019re harnessing the benefits and outweighing the costs,\u201d Perez said. Biden announced on Tuesday increased tariffs on $18 billion in Chinese imports, focusing on steel, aluminum, legacy semiconductors, electric vehicles, battery components, critical minerals, solar cells, cranes and medical products. The new tariff rates range from 100% on EVs, to 50% for solar components, to 25% for all other sectors. A senior administration official tells CNN that the White House believes the new tariffs introduced this week won\u2019t raise prices because they apply to product groups that are symbolic, but represent only a small amount of US imports. For instance, the US imported just $368 million in battery-powered vehicles from China in 2023, according to the Atlantic Council, compared to $7.4 billion in EVs from western Europe. But the Biden administration is also leaving in place Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff program affecting some $300 billion in Chinese imports, which JP Morgan economists in 2019 estimated would cost American households $1,000 each year. White House officials for years debated whether to remove certain tariffs on consumer products in a bid to ease some of those prices. In April 2022, near the height of inflation, a senior aide raised the question at an event hosted by the Bretton Woods Committee of why some tariffs remained in place that could hurt consumers. \u201cWhy do we have tariffs on bicycles or apparel or underwear?\u201d asked Daleep Singh, deputy national security adviser for international economics. Pressed to elaborate on those comments, then-press secretary Jen Psaki acknowledged that \u201csome of the tariffs implemented by the previous administration were not strategic and instead raised costs on Americans.\u201d In the end, the senior administration official said, foreign policy considerations outweighed the argument for a slight reduction in consumer prices. Biden concluded it wasn\u2019t the time to back down from the tariff position and lose leverage in challenging Beijing\u2019s unfair trade practices. Trump enacted sweeping tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese imports, setting off a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. And Trump has vowed to triple down on that strategy if he\u2019s returned to the White House, promising a 10% across-the-board tariff on imports, a 60% tariff on imports from China and a 100% tariff on foreign cars. Economists have warned that Trump\u2019s trade agenda would hurt the US economy by worsening inflation, killing jobs, depressing growth and spooking investors. The focus on Tai\u2019s comments underscores the point that no matter who wins in November, tariffs are not going away. That\u2019s encouraging news to China hawks but troubling to those concerned about protectionism and inflation. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, expressed dismay at Biden\u2019s new tariffs on Tuesday. \u201cThis is horrible news for American consumers and a major setback for clean energy,\u201d Polis said on X in response to a Biden post. \u201cTariffs are a direct, regressive tax on Americans and this tax increase will hit every family.\u201d Even though lowering tariffs could help ease inflation, Republicans, Democrats and business leaders are focused on addressing China\u2019s trade tactics. And politicians want to be seen as protecting US jobs. \u201cAny reduction in tariffs would be seen as being soft on China. And the only true bipartisan stance in DC right now is being hard on China,\u201d said Ed Mills, policy strategist at Raymond James. David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, warned that not only do tariffs raise prices, they mess with supply chains and invite retaliation. He argued that US officials could help lower inflation by negotiating lower tariff rates with China. \u201cIt\u2019s depressing to see both parties embrace protectionism, which never makes the country richer,\u201d Kelly told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a curse on both of their houses. Tariffs make people poorer. Both parties are playing this game.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/business/biden-tariffs-trade-trump-tai/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

Famed\u00a0New York Times\u00a0journalist\u00a0Nicholas Kristof\u00a0on Tuesday will release his memoir,\u00a0\u201cChasing Hope: A Reporter\u2019s Life.\u201d\u00a0In the 432-page work, which I was provided an advanced copy of, Kristof vividly recounts some of the most pivotal experiences that have made up his decades as a reporter, foreign correspondent, bureau chief, and columnist for The Gray Lady. The book, of course, arrives as the American press still wrestles with how to cover\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0and the anti-democratic movement which he leads. Kristof, having spent years reporting on repressive governments across far-flung corners of the globe, is not shy about offering the lessons he has learned covering autocrats. The American press, he writes in clear-eyed terms, \u201cshouldn\u2019t be neutral about upholding democracy\u201d and must not \u201cdispassionately observe our way to authoritarianism.\u201d We spoke with Kristof over email for a Q&A about this and more. Our conversation is printed below in its unedited form. The opening scene of your memoir takes place in the Congo in 1997. You write that you thought you might lose your life on that reporting trip. At the end of your book, you write about how being a foreign correspondent has dramatically transformed as a profession. Today, you explain, foreign reporting trips are highly choreographed. The New York Times has its \u201cown James Bond-style Q\u201d who hands out special gear before heading into the field for trips and security consultants are there every step of the way. How beneficial have these resources been to journalism? They keep journalists alive. Look, in the old days, we just took off into war zones and sometimes got extraordinary stories by taking imprudent risks. I lost friends because of the risk-taking, and the reason I\u2019m able to write this answer for you is that I repeatedly was lucky. Early in the Iraq war, I calculated that journalists were dying proportionately at ten times the rate of American troops, because we weren\u2019t careful enough. When I last crossed into Syria during the civil war, I grumbled because the Times sent security consultants to escort me and they didn\u2019t let me sneak into Aleppo \u2014 but then journalists soon began to be kidnapped and tortured, so now I\u2019m very grateful to The Times for restraining me. My wife is even more grateful. In the 1980s, you write that as a reporter for The NYT you \u201chad a freedom that journalists today could barely fathom,\u201d in that \u201cmuch of the time, editors had little idea\u201d what you were working on. In your view, and broadly speaking, do reporters not have enough independence to go out into the world, find stories of importance and chase them? Is the 2024 journalist too chained to their desk? This is strange for a pundit to admit, but I think there\u2019s too much punditry in journalism today and not enough reporting. There can be a good audience for a political hit piece whipped out while sitting at a desk without actually talking to anyone, or for a talking head to do the same on television, but I deeply believe that where we in journalism most add value is when we go out and report; it\u2019s not when we stir the pot but when we add to the pot. I also think that\u2019s where we have the most impact. If I write about Trump, abortion, the Middle East, guns or other issues at the top of the agenda, fellow liberals will cheer me on, and conservatives will scoff \u2014 but I won\u2019t change minds. In contrast, where I\u2019ve been able to have an impact has always been by projecting issues onto the agenda. Darfur. Sex trafficking. Some human rights, poverty and health issues. And that happens only by getting out of the office and reporting. That\u2019s not just true of global crises. We\u2019re losing more than 100,000 Americans a year to overdoses, and I don\u2019t think we in journalism have adequately covered that catastrophe in working-class America. I think that\u2019s partly because of a lack of class diversity in our ranks. It\u2019s been a very difficult time to work as a journalist over the last few years. Scores of people have been laid off at nearly every major outlet, local newspapers have shuttered from coast-to-coast, and newsrooms continue to search for a viable economic model to remain operational into the future. You write in your book about how journalists should focus more on solutions. Is there a solution to these problems afflicting the industry that you see? I would never have imagined saying this a decade ago, but today I\u2019d be open to government grants to keep alive local news organizations around the country. The National Endowment for the Arts provides grants for local artists, and I\u2019d say that it\u2019s even more important that a town have a newspaper than that it have a theater. In terms of larger news organizations, philanthropy may be part of the answer. But I\u2019m deeply worried about what A.I. may do to the business model of news organizations. That\u2019s a shadow hanging over all of us. If we\u2019re not careful, down the road we won\u2019t be getting news from The New York Times, CNN or even TikTok, but from an A.I. assistant who pillages content from journalists and gives us a rehash that is tailor made to reinforce our own biases. As a foreign correspondent, you write openly about living with the consequences of having \u201coccasionally got[ten] sources in trouble\u201d when you perhaps were not careful enough. What advice might you offer journalists, particularly those reporting in countries ruled by oppressive leaders, so that they do not make such mistakes and live \u201chaunted by the fear\u201d that they may have \u201cinflicted suffering rather than alleviated it\u201d? Too many journalists aren\u2019t careful enough about protecting sources. The ethos in journalism has tended to be to provide as much description of a source as possible, and that makes sense in Washington. But with a Chinese person who may not understand the risk, I think we have a duty of care that may involve withholding part of someone\u2019s identity. When I\u2019m in China, there are armies of State Security people tailing me, using a zone-to-zone defense where they pass me from one person to the next, plus cameras on streets \u2014 and it\u2019s not a game. You make a mistake, and you destroy someone\u2019s life. One story I tell in \u201cChasing Hope\u201d is of a Chinese man who had information about missiles that I desperately wanted to get, and I met him secretly several time trying to wheedle the information out of him. \u00a0And by the end, I told him just to go home and never be in touch with a foreigner again. I knew that there was always some risk that I would get a great story, and he would be executed. It wasn\u2019t worth it. It felt strange to be turning away from a good story, but I\u2019m glad I did. You wanted to become governor of Oregon to change society for the better but were found ineligible to appear on the state\u2019s ballot over a residency requirement. You write in your book, however, that afterward you realized, \u201cPerhaps the grass is invariably greener on the other side of the fence.\u201d Do you believe that one can be more impactful working in journalism than politics? That\u2019s certainly true at times. William Safire, when asked if he would leave his Times column to be Secretary of State, replied: \u201cWhy take a step down?\u201d Look, there are great journalists and great politicians. I bellyflopped as a politician, so I\u2019m doing what I can with my keyboard. In the book, you write about efforts led by Donald Trump and his allies to \u201cundermine democracy.\u201d You offer a chilling description of what a \u201cpopulist authoritarianism\u201d might look like in the U.S., noting the federal government could be weaponized and \u201cused to punish or intimidate news organizations.\u201d You even write about how there could be \u201cassassinations\u201d that occur amid heightened polarization. As someone who has spent his entire life reporting across the world, do you believe that the American public truly understands the risks that you outline? Or do you believe that people are under the illusion such horrors cannot happen here? I\u2019ve seen how countries can unravel and how democracies can become more despotic, and I do think that many Americans don\u2019t appreciate the risks. We tend to think that change will be linear. Sometimes it zigs or zags. You write in your book that with so much at stake in 2024, \u201cJournalists must not settle for being dispassionate stenographers, quoting first one side and then the other.\u201d Instead, you say, \u201cOur foremost obligation is to report the truth, wherever it lies and whomever this offends. \u2026 We journalists shouldn\u2019t dispassionately observe our way to authoritarianism; we shouldn\u2019t be neutral about upholding democracy.\u201d Do you believe your colleagues in the press are as clear-eyed about this as you are? Some are and some aren\u2019t. Look, it\u2019s messy. Traditionally, we try to be fair and truthful. We aim to be fair by quoting all sides in a dispute, and most of the time that serves the interests of truth. But not always. During the Joe McCarthy period, it didn\u2019t work to quote McCarthy\u2019s rants and also the defenses of people he accused of being Communists; it took Edward R. Murrow to say clearly that McCarthy was a lying, bullying demagogue. Likewise, in the civil rights movement, it didn\u2019t work to quote Martin Luther King Jr. in one paragraph and George Wallace in the next. It took reporters going down South and, at considerable risk, conveying the brutality of Jim Crow segregation. Likewise, I think in 2016 we in the media treated Trump as just another candidate when, in my view, he was quite different. We were fair but perhaps not truthful, and I think our paramount responsibility is to convey the truths we know. But doing that with humility and effectiveness is really hard to pull off. Why do you believe that institutions and so many journalists find it difficult to flatly state that Trump is an anti-democratic candidate? I have enough trouble defining and defending my own square foot of principle. I won\u2019t try to speak for other journalists. I must ask: The NYT\u2019s top editor, Joe Kahn, recently drew backlash for saying, \u201cTo say that the threats of democracy are so great that the media is going to abandon its central role as a source of impartial information to help people vote \u2014 that\u2019s essentially saying that the news media should become a propaganda arm for a single candidate, because we prefer that candidate\u2019s agenda.\u201d What do you make of Kahn\u2019s comments? I think people are reading too much into a brief quote that can\u2019t encompass the complexity of running a newsroom today. I\u2019ve known Joe Kahn for 35 years, I admire him, and I believe in his commitment to accountability journalism \u2014 in China and in America. Will we periodically make mistakes? Of course. But The Times is an amazing institution that takes very seriously its responsibility to this country, to its democracy and to its future. Let\u2019s try to find a positive note to end on, amid all this doom and gloom. What gives you hope for the future of journalism? Bad journalism may never have been as bad as it is today, but great journalism has never been better. I\u2019m staggered by the brilliance of some of the multimedia, video and audio journalism I see today, by the dedication of colleagues to uncover the truth and by the courage of journalists risking their lives today in Gaza, Russia and elsewhere. The way photo journalists rush toward gunfire \u2014 it\u2019s poetry! I\u2019m awed by the caliber of young journalists flocking to the field even though we don\u2019t have a clear business model to provide them paychecks. And as I say in \u201cChasing Hope,\u201d journalism itself is an act of hope. We do what we do because we believe it makes a difference. What we do matters. I believe that journalism \u2014 along with law and the civil service \u2014 restrained the Trump presidency and is a force for civilization and democracy. When I was on Tiananmen Square that terrible night of June 3-4, 1989, as Chinese troops opened fire on us to crush the pro-democracy movement, a rickshaw driver picked up the body of a young man who had been shot. He drove his rickshaw by me, so that I could witness the broken, bleeding body and report on it. \u201cTell the world,\u201d the driver shouted, as tears streamed down his cheeks. \u201cTell the world.\u201d He believed that reporting mattered, that truth can eventually prevail, that what we do makes a difference. Some day, unpredictably, truth triumphs. He believed it and I believe it, and that is why I say that journalism is an act of hope.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/media/nicholas-kristof-press-trump-democracy-threat/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_investing_dow-40000", "text": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average broke past the 40,000 threshold Thursday for the first time ever, fueled by an encouraging inflation report. The blue-chip index briefly crossed the key threshold in morning trading before falling back below the line in the afternoon to close at 39,869, down 38 points, or 0.1%. All three major indexes closed lower on Thursday. The S&P 500 ended the day down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.3% lower. Markets had rallied to new record highs Wednesday after the latest Consumer Price Index showed a cooldown for the first time in months, stoking hopes that the Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates as soon as September. On a monthly basis, the inflation report showed that prices rose 0.3%, a slower pace than in the two months prior, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists were expecting a 0.4% monthly increase, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Another key data point added to the enthusiasm: April retail sales came in significantly weaker than expected, indicating that consumers are pulling back on the spending that drives the economy. Spending missed the 0.4% increase that economists had projected. \u201cThis is the first good CPI report in four months and the market likes it,\u201d said Gary Pzegeo, head of fixed income at CIBC Private Wealth US. \u201cTaken [together with retail sales] this supports a Fed rate cut in the fall.\u00a0Markets are discounting a cut in September and have moved to price in a second cut by December.\u201d President Joe Biden celebrated the move Thursday. \u201cThis is great news for Americans\u2019 retirement accounts and another sign of confidence in America\u2019s economy,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI\u2019m building an economy from the middle out and bottom up \u2014 and our investments are making a difference.\u201d Main Street vs. Wall Street The new record for the Dow, made of 30 blue-chip stocks, marks a symbolic shift for investors who \u2014 despite elevated interest and inflation rates, geopolitical strife and years of recession warnings \u2014 still feel good about the US economy. It also highlights a notable contrast between sentiment on Wall Street and Main Street. Consumer sentiment plunged to the lowest level in six months as price increases reaccelerated, according to a University of Michigan survey of consumers released earlier this month. The recent inflation crisis has given Americans angst about the economy, and recent CNN polls show that many people believe the US economy is headed in the wrong direction. Some even believe the United States is currently in a recession, although there\u2019s no evidence of that. Overall, 26% of Americans currently say that economic conditions have stabilized, according to CNN data from February. Nearly half of Americans say they believe the economy remains in a downturn. The first three months of 2024 brought remarkable market momentum. The S&P 500 hit 22 new records between January 1 and April. But, since then, markets have become volatile, as investors began to fear that inflation and interest rates would remain higher for longer. Wednesday\u2019s CPI report changed that perception. \u201cThis was a good report in the context of three hotter-than-expected [CPI] reports, and it makes it look like potentially those were bumps in the road rather than a really stagnant inflation environment,\u201d Tyler Schipper, economics professor at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota, told CNN in an interview. Crossing 40,000 Crossing the 40,000 level doesn\u2019t hold much practical value for investors, but it does catch the attention of the public and, some argue, it could help propel that optimistic sentiment beyond Wall Street. \u201cThe Dow 40,000 milestone also shows how resilient the US economy has been, at a time where there was a plethora of calls for a recession,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial, in a recent note to CNN. \u201cThe overarching importance of crossing these big round numbers is that it brings Wall Street news to Main Street, at least for a day. It also serves as an affirmation that corporate earnings are growing, and that investor confidence remains robust,\u201d he said. To many Americans, \u201cthe Dow\u201d simply means the stock market. The index\u2019s small cache of stocks \u2014 ranging from Microsoft to McDonald\u2019s to Chevron \u2014 represents some of the largest companies in the nation and are widely held among retail and institutional investors alike. A look back Here are some important stops along the Dow\u2019s road to 40,000: Dow is formed: The first daily close, on May 26, 1896, was 40.94. The Dow did not get off to a good start, plunging 30% to an all-time low of 28.48 by August that year. Dow 100: The Dow first closed in triple digits in January 1906. That marked an impressive rally for the average, which had hit an all-time low when Teddy Roosevelt was president. The Federal Reserve would not be created for seven more years. Crash of 1929: The Dow fell 38 points on Oct. 28 and 31 more points the next day. That might not sound bad today, but it represented back-to-back declines of 13% and 12% of the Dow\u2019s value. They are still two of the worst one-day percentage declines in the index\u2019s history. Dow 1,000: Nov. 14, 1972. Richard Nixon had just won reelection by taking 49 states. The Dow\u2019s components, which had been unchanged for 13 years, included Woolworth, Eastman Kodak and International Nickel. Crash of 1987: On Oct. 19, the Dow plunged 508 points, a 23% drop that is still the largest one-day percentage decline in history. A week later it took an 8% plunge. But the damage was short-lived: Within a year, the Dow was back to pre-crash levels. Dow 10,000: March 29, 1999. The \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d of the tech bubble was in full swing as the Dow gained 1,000 points in less than a year to hit this benchmark. It gained 1,000 more points in just the next month. A year later, the dot-com stock bubble burst, sending the Dow down nearly 30% by September 2001. Meltdown of 2008-2009: The financial crisis caused the Dow to lose about half its value in less than a year, bottoming out to close at 6,547 on March 9, 2009. The worst day was Sept. 29, 2008, when the Dow lost what was then a record 778 points after Congress rejected a $700 billion bank bailout. The bailout was later approved. Dow 15,000: May 7, 2013. As the economy continued to recover from the Great Recession, the Dow had one of the current bull market\u2019s strongest periods. It crossed the 15,000 mark and finished the year up 26.5%, marking the best full-year performance of the current bull market. The Dow nearly matched that in 2017, rising 25%. Dow 20,000: January 25, 2017. The stock market had enjoyed a nice run starting on the day after the 2016 election, with the Dow gaining nearly 10% as investors looked forward to lower taxes and less regulation under the Trump administration. Dow 25,000: Jan. 4, 2018. The passage of the Trump tax cuts, especially the lowering of the corporate tax rate in December 2017, helped feed the quick move between 20,000 and 25,000. Dow 30,000: Nov. 24, 2020: Covid sent the stock market plunging in the spring of 2020. But new hopes of a vaccine and the results of the presidential election ended an era of uncertainty on Wall Street, sending the stock market rolling once again.

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_16_tech_europe-investigation-meta-child-safety", "text": "The European Union is worried that Meta is failing to protect children on its platforms, Facebook and Instagram, and has launched a formal investigation that could result in a hefty fine. The probe is the latest evidence that regulators are increasingly focussing on the harmful impact of Meta\u2019s platforms \u2014 and other social media \u2014 on young users, including by encouraging addictive behavior. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, will consider whether Meta (META) has complied with its obligations under the Digital Services Act (DSA), the bloc\u2019s sweeping new law for online platforms. The legislation requires online platforms to put in place measures to protect children, including by preventing them from accessing inappropriate content and ensuring a high level of privacy and safety. Non-compliance could result in companies being fined as much as 6% of their global revenue or being forced to change their software. The European Commission is concerned that Facebook\u2019s and Instagram\u2019s online interfaces \u201cmay exploit\u00a0the weaknesses and inexperience of minors\u00a0and cause\u00a0addictive behavior,\u201d it said in a statement Thursday. \u201cThe Commission is also concerned about age assurance and verification methods put in place by Meta,\u201d it added, noting that these may not be effective. In a statement shared with CNN, a spokesperson for Meta responded: \u201cWe want young people to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online and have spent a decade developing more than 50 tools and policies designed to protect them. This is a challenge the whole industry is facing, and we look forward to sharing details of our work with the European Commission.\u201d A report the company submitted to the European Commission last September, detailing how its platforms protect minors, was not enough to assuage regulators\u2019 concerns. \u201cWe are not convinced that (Meta) has done enough to comply with the DSA obligations to mitigate the risks of negative effects to the physical and mental health of young Europeans,\u201d Commissioner Thierry Breton, said in the statement. \u201cWe are sparing no effort to protect our children.\u201d Meta has faced growing scrutiny over the impact of its platforms on young users in recent years. The social media giant has been sued by various US school districts and state attorney generals in lawsuits related to youth mental health, child safety and privacy. Earlier this month, an investigation by the New Mexico attorney general into the potential dangers of Meta\u2019s platforms resulted in the arrests of three men charged with attempted sexual abuse of children. Meta has also been frequently caught in the crosshairs of EU regulators, including over its handling of advertising by scammers and foreign election meddlers ahead of upcoming EU elections, as well as over disinformation and illegal content on its platforms linked to the war in Gaza.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/tech/europe-investigation-meta-child-safety/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_business_dow-40000-history-nightcap", "text": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is, at best, an imperfect barometer of stock market activity among a narrow band of very large US companies. It\u2019s clunky, and too limited in scope for any Wall Street pros to pay serious attention to it. Nevertheless, the Dow persists. When the Dow hit the 40,000 mark on Thursday, the news was splashed across most major TV news chyrons and websites, that comforting whole number telling the world that something good is happening. Maybe you\u2019re not quite sure what it means. But you know it\u2019s up, and up is better than down. \u201cMention \u2018the Dow\u2019 and, to most people, that means the stock market,\u201d said market strategist Art Hogan. \u201cThe Dow Jones industrial average is an instant way of telling the world which way the market is moving, even if the average isn\u2019t an accurate measure of the thousands of stocks listed on the nation\u2019s exchanges.\u201d While most professional investors look at the S&P 500 \u2014 a much broader measure of what\u2019s happening on Wall Street \u2014 everyday Americans look to the Dow. The number of Google searches for \u201cDow Jones\u201d is always higher than the searches for \u201cS&P 500,\u201d\u00a0said Nick Colas, co-founder of market research firm DataTrek. \u201cIf you\u2019re not an investor, you know that a rising stock market means the economy is decent, and you probably have less of a chance of being laid off,\u201d Colas said. There\u2019s nothing magical about the Dow. It\u2019s just an index that tracks the stock market activity of 30 large US companies, from Amazon to McDonald\u2019s to the Walt Disney Company. But it is very old, and that\u2019s partly why it sticks around. \u201cThe Dow is, no doubt, an anachronistic index,\u201d says Daniel Alpert, managing partner of\u00a0Westwood Capital. \u201cIts primary benefit is that it goes back forever.\u201d Deep roots If you wanted to peek at what stocks were doing in the days leading up to the October 1929 crash, the Dow is the only index that has that information preserved in amber. You can trace the Dow back to the 1890s, whereas the S&P 500 wasn\u2019t created until 1957, well after the economic upheaval of World War II. The Dow serves as a running history of the US economy, like those charts that show the evolution of humans from Neanderthal to homo sapien. You can track the rise and fall of heavy industry and the emergence of Silicon Valley through changes in the Dow\u2019s composition, which was once dominated by the likes of Standard Oil and US Steel. These days, UnitedHealth, Microsoft and Goldman Sachs are the Dow heavyweights. Weird weighting Serious traders sometimes look down their nose at the Dow because of the way it ranks companies by share price, rather than by market capitalization, like the S&P 500 does. Market capitalization measures the total value of a company on the stock market. In the Dow, a smaller company with less relevance to the economy can outweigh a bigger company. In its current iteration, for example, the Dow deems Goldman Sachs \u2014 a Wall Street bank with almost no consumer-facing business, valued at about $125 billion \u2014 more important than Apple, a nearly $3 trillion tech behemoth with a billion customers. The way the points work: You take the price of one share of each of the 30 companies, add those up and divide by the \u201cDow divisor,\u201d a constant figure that helps account for fluctuations in the market. Explaining the weird logic of the Dow, Colas told me: \u201cIf somebody asks you how your kids are, what you do is you add up their ages. I\u2019ve got a 10, 5 and 3 year old \u2014 I\u2019m an 18 \u2026 A higher number doesn\u2019t really tell you anything, but it\u2019s like, OK, my kids are getting older.\u201d Despite its flaws, the Dow is a strong brand that\u2019s been embedded in the American psyche. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly imperfect index,\u201d Alpert says. \u201cBut it\u2019s the word that, in the shortest possible number of letters, describes Wall Street.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/business/dow-40000-history-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_business_immigration-trump-inflation-jobs", "text": "If voters return former President Donald Trump to the White House, he\u2019s promised to launch an unprecedented crackdown on immigration and even conduct mass deportations. Trump recently told Time that he would aim to deport 15 million to 20 million people, perhaps by using the National Guard. Some economists worry that Trump\u2019s proposed immigration crackdown \u2014 if it survived legal challenges \u2014 would backfire on the US economy by worsening worker shortages, reigniting inflation and forcing the Federal Reserve to keep borrowing costs high for even longer. \u201cIf he follows through in deporting a significant amount of immigrants, that\u2019s going to be very difficult for businesses,\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s, told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s going to cause them to raise wages and prices.\u201d Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, said the problem is that the supply of native-born workers simply cannot meet demand. \u201cWe need to import workers,\u201d Brusuelas said. \u201cIf either party oversteps in reducing the flow of workers, it\u2019s likely we would face a serious shortage of workers and a renewed bout of inflation. You would drive the unemployment rate down to 3% and wages would pop. You\u2019d get classic inflation.\u201d And that would have serious implications for the Fed, which has already warned that interest rates will need to stay high for longer than anticipated to fight stubborn inflation. \u201cIn that case, higher for longer has a much different meaning,\u201d said Brusuelas. In a statement to CNN, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt argued, without evidence, that President Joe Biden \u201callowed\u201d undocumented immigrants to \u201cinvade our border\u201d and that if he\u2019s reelected they will be allowed to stay. \u201cMedicare, Social Security, the healthcare system, public safety and American democracy itself will buckle and collapse,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cWhen President\u00a0Trump\u00a0is back in the White House, he will deport the millions of illegal immigrants Joe Biden let in and reimplement his America First, pro-growth, pro-job agenda to uplift all Americans.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s a rip-off\u2019 Inflation remains a major concern for Americans. Even though consumer prices are no longer skyrocketing, the cumulative impact of three years of high inflation is painful. Americans are paying much more for housing, food and car insurance than they were before Covid-19. Frustrations with the high cost of living helped drive down consumer sentiment to a six-month low, the University of Michigan survey of consumers found on Friday. \u201cMost Americans view high inflation and high prices as unfair. It\u2019s a rip-off. How is it possible I\u2019m paying more for something \u2013 a lot more for something \u2013 today than three years ago?\u201d said Zandi. Anger over inflation could help return Trump to the White House. And yet, ironically, economists warn that his immigration plan \u2013 and his vow to impose massive tariffs on China and other nations \u2013 could worsen that same inflation problem. \u201cMy sense is President Trump\u2019s policies are inflationary,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cIt\u2019s higher tariffs, it\u2019s more deportations. \u2026 I think these things are going to lead to higher prices for American consumers.\u201d Some businesses continue to face a shortage of workers. Although the number of job openings has tumbled in recent months, it remains well above pre-pandemic levels, according to the Labor Department. Migrant crisis Of course, it\u2019s hard to know whether Trump would carry through on his immigration proposals. After all, he promised mass deportations in 2016, too. And Trump\u2019s immigration plans would surely face serious legal challenges. But immigration remains a major concern for voters in the 2024 election and Trump has made it a centerpiece of his campaign. The spike in immigration over the last several years has caused a severe strain on resources in some cities and states as officials scramble to house, educate and feed asylum seekers. And the flow of migrants, along with a series of high-profile criminal cases involving migrants, have contributed to concerns about crime \u2014 though criminologists are skeptical about the connection. Even the Biden administration has tried to take a tougher position on immigration. Last week, US officials proposed a rule that would let immigration authorities rapidly reject migrants who are ineligible for asylum. A positive supply shock Yet economists say the immigration spike has also played a major role in one of the big positive surprises of the past few years: America\u2019s ability to defy recession forecasts. To the shock of many forecasters, the post-Covid labor market has not run out of workers. Jobs growth continues at a pace few thought possible. And the unemployment rate has stayed under 4% for 27 months in a row, matching the record streak from 1967 to 1970. Economists say the recent spike in immigration helped make these surprises possible, by preventing the jobs market from totally overheating and the Fed from overdoing rate hikes. \u201cIt helped to ease the very tight labor market, bring in some of those wage pressures and reduce inflation,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cIt also allowed the economy to grow more quickly.\u201d Prior to Covid-19, population and labor force projections from the federal government suggested the US economy would only be able to sustainably add (without worsening inflation) between 60,000 and 140,000 jobs per month and then between 60,000 and 100,000 per month by 2024, according to research from The Hamilton Project. In reality, the US economy added an average of 255,000 jobs per month in 2023 \u2014 two to four times the pace considered sustainable, research notes. \u201cJust in the last year, a big part of the story of the labor market coming back into better balance is immigration returning to levels that were more typical of the pre-pandemic era,\u201d Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in February. Net immigration of 2.3 million in 2023 The Hamilton Project paper estimates sustainable employment growth will be between 160,000 and 200,000 per month in 2024 \u2014 about double what would have been possible before the immigration surge. Without that influx of workers, the US economy could have faced a different fate. \u201cThe Fed would have likely overdone it with rates and tipped the economy into recession,\u201d said Brusuelas, the RSM economist. Immigration collapsed when the Covid-19 pandemic began in early 2020, contributing to the historic shortage of workers that drove up wages. But then immigration rebounded massively in 2022 and 2023, in part because of a surge of migrants. US authorities had more than 2.5 million encounters with migrants crossing the US-Mexico border last year alone, according to Homeland Security estimates. In 2023, the United States experienced net immigration of about 3.3 million, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That well exceeds the average of just 900,000 that was typical between 2010 and 2019. The immigration spike has been so significant that the CBO estimates the United States is on track to have 1.7 million more people in its pool of workers this year compared with what was expected last year. Goldman Sachs economists estimate that the immigration surge eased wage growth by 0.3 percentage points at the national level and by at least twice as much in the low-paying leisure and hospitality sector. Although the \u201ctextbook answer\u201d is that immigration should not matter much for wages and inflation, Goldman Sachs economists recently told clients: \u201cWe think this time was a bit different.\u201d \u201cThe main reasons are that the immigration turnaround was very large and that it occurred at a time when the labor market was historically overheated,\u201d Goldman Sachs economists wrote. What happens next Looking ahead, Goldman Sachs said \u201cmoderate fluctuations\u201d in immigration will probably have \u201clittle impact\u201d on wage growth and inflation. The exception, the bank said, would be in the event of \u201cdramatic policy changes.\u201d Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project and senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, told CNN she is \u201cconfident\u201d an immigration crackdown like the one Trump proposes would have \u201cnegative\u201d effects on the economy. However, Edelberg is less concerned about the inflationary impact and more worried about a crash in demand \u2014 especially in communities that have experienced a large influx of immigrants. She noted that some businesses have enjoyed a sharp increase in demand in recent years in large part because of immigrants. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thing that could spark a recession,\u201d Edelberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to suggest this would be a cataclysmic recession, but this would be a very abrupt reduction in aggregate demand. Generally, that\u2019s not the kind of thing that our economy likes.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/business/immigration-trump-inflation-jobs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_business_royal-mail-takeover-daniel-kretinsky", "text": "Royal Mail dates back to the Tudors. It has been operating a postal service in England since the reign of Henry VIII. Now this most British of institutions is on the brink of being sold to a Czech billionaire, Daniel K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd, raising fears about the fate of thousands of workers and a key national service. British logistics company International Distribution Services (IDS), which owns the loss-making postal service, said Wednesday that it was \u201cminded to recommend\u201d to its shareholders a \u00a33.70-per-share ($4.69) takeover offer from K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd\u2019s EP Group. EP Group has until May 29 to convert its \u00a33.5 billion ($4.4 billion) non-biding offer into a formal bid for IDS. The likely sale would come after a difficult few years for Royal Mail, which was privatized in 2013. It has suffered a sharp drop in demand for its services, and losses have ballooned. Appeals to the government to be released from its obligation to deliver letters six days a week have fallen on deaf ears. A spokesperson for the UK Department for Business and Trade told CNN that it had \u201cno current plans\u201d to change Royal Mail\u2019s legally binding service obligations. \u201cAny future changes to Royal Mail\u2019s operation will need to take into account the impacts on businesses and vulnerable consumers who rely on this vital service,\u201d the spokesperson said. So who is the white knight ready to take on a company that, during the last financial year, was losing \u00a38 million ($10 million) a week? The \u2018Czech Sphinx\u2019 K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd is a Czech national who has made his fortune through a sprawling empire of European energy companies, retailers and football clubs. He is worth an estimated $7.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The 49-year-old magnate began his career as a lawyer, before moving to a Czech investment bank, where he became a partner in 2003, according to EP Group\u2019s website. A few years later, K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd co-founded Energetick\u00fd a pr\u016fmyslov\u00fd holding, or EPH, which owns European gas- and coal-fired power plants, commodities trading firms and freight companies, its website shows. In 2016, the billionaire founded EP Group with business partner Patrik Tk\u00e1\u010d. Through its investment arm Vesa Equity Investment, K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd has acquired stakes in big-name brands such as Foot Locker (FL) in the United States, FNAC in France, and supermarket Sainsbury\u2019s in the United Kingdom. He has come to be known as a mysterious personality given his reluctance to speak publicly about his business dealings. So elusive, in fact, that the Polish version of Newsweek magazine dubbed him the \u201cCzech Sphinx\u201d in 2019. The Sphinx, a mythical creature originating in Greek mythology, requires travelers to solve a riddle before allowing them to pass. But some fans of British soccer will already know his name. Three years ago, the businessman bought a 27% stake in West Ham United Football Club through another of his investment firms. That makes K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd the club\u2019s second-biggest shareholder, according its website. \u2018As British as it gets\u2019 The potential buyout of Royal Mail has stirred anxieties about the consequences of the iconic British institution coming under foreign ownership. Reuters reported Thursday, citing a spokesperson for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, that UK business minister Kemi Badenoch was expected to meet with IDS to discuss the takeover bid. Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, which represents about 110,000 Royal Mail workers, said the potential takeover by K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd\u2019s investment firm posed a \u201cthreat\u201d to the future of postal services in the UK. He asked that EP Group \u201cimmediately demonstrate\u201d a commitment to working with the CWU and rule out any potential break-up of Royal Mail or diminishment of its workers\u2019 pension pots. \u201cIt cannot be right that a key part of national infrastructure is allowed to be owned by individuals or companies who have no vision for the future and no clear plan to put the workforce at the heart of turning Royal Mail around,\u201d Ward said in a statement Wednesday. Jonathan Reynolds, business spokesperson for the UK\u2019s opposition Labour Party, urged EP Group in a letter to provide \u201ccast-iron guarantees\u201d that it would keep Royal Mail\u2019s headquarters in the UK, and would work closely with its labor union. \u201cRoyal Mail is as British as it gets, and Labour will take the necessary steps to safeguard its undeniable identity and place in public life,\u201d he wrote in the letter, which he posted on X. In a statement last month, EP Group said it was \u201ca committed long-term investor in the UK\u201d and believed that private investment in Royal Mail was \u201ccrucial\u201d as the service faced escalating competition with multinational companies in the UK postal market. \u201cRoyal Mail is an important national asset that would benefit from being able to take a longer-term view,\u201d the firm said. \u201c(EP Group) is prepared to support this iconic business as it transforms and rebuilds into a modern postal operator delivering high-quality service to its customers, stability to its workforce and sustainable financial performance.\u201d Ivana Kottasov\u00e1 contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/business/royal-mail-takeover-daniel-kretinsky/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_tech_damaging-hacks-expose-the-weak-underbelly-of-americas-health-care-system", "text": "A pair of recent ransomware attacks crippled computer systems at two major American health care firms, disrupting patient care and exposing fundamental weaknesses in the US health care system\u2019s defenses against hackers. In both cases, federal officials and private cyber experts scrambled to try to limit the damage and get computers back online. But the cascading effects from the hacks, with ambulances diverted from hospitals and pharmacies unable to process insurance, has underscored for some US lawmakers, senior Biden administration officials and policy experts that the health care system is ill-prepared for the ripple effects of a cyberattack and needs new security regulations. Health care lags other industries such as big financial institutions and energy providers when it comes to IT security, according to some experts. \u201cIndustry has successfully demanded voluntary cybersecurity for years \u2014 and this is what we get,\u201d Joshua Corman, a cybersecurity expert who has focused on the health sector for years, told CNN. Sen. Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who chairs the finance committee, told CNN that \u201cevery new devastating hack hammers home the need for mandatory cybersecurity standards in the health care sector, particularly when it comes to the largest companies that millions of patients depend on for care and medicine.\u201d Without action, the senator said, \u201cpatients\u2019 access to care and their personal health information will be compromised and ransomed by hackers over and over again.\u201d In 2023, 46 hospital systems in the US, comprising 141 hospitals, were impacted by ransomware,\u00a0according\u00a0to a tally from cybersecurity firm Emsisoft.\u00a0That\u2019s up from 25 hospital systems hit by ransomware in 2022, according to the firm. The two ransomware attacks hit different nerves of the health care system. In February, cybercriminals broke into an unsecured computer server used by Change Healthcare, an insurance billing giant that processes about 15 billion health care transactions annually. The hack cut off health care providers from billions of dollars of revenue, snarled service at pharmacies across the US and\u00a0may have compromised\u00a0the personal data of a third of Americans. In early May, cybercriminals used a different type of ransomware in an attack on Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit network that includes 140 hospitals and 40 senior living facilities in 19 states. The hack\u00a0forced\u00a0the health network to divert ambulances from some hospitals. The Biden administration is preparing to issue minimum cybersecurity requirements for US hospitals, senior White House cyber official Anne Neuberger confirmed this month. The details of that proposal have yet to be finalized. But the American Hospital Association, which represents hospitals across the United States, opposes the proposal, saying it would effectively re-victimize victims of cyberattacks by imposing penalties after they are hacked. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services previously said\u00a0they are willing to use a number of measures,\u00a0including\u00a0imposing\u00a0monetary fines, to both force and encourage health care organizations to better secure their systems. Momentum is also growing on Capitol Hill to force health care organizations to meet basic cybersecurity standards. A bill\u00a0introduced\u00a0in March by Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, would allow \u201cadvanced and accelerated\u201d Medicare payments to be sent to hacked health care providers as long as those providers and their contractors meet minimum cybersecurity standards. An unhealthy situation The ransomware attacks on Change Healthcare and Ascension have spotlighted the health sector\u2019s cybersecurity weakness like no other events before it, experts told CNN. And even if there are new regulatory requirements for cybersecurity, the sector \u201cwill continue to struggle from such attacks if the business of providing\u00a0healthcare remains financially fraught [and forces] leaders to prioritize only revenue generating investments,\u201d Carter Groome, chief executive of cybersecurity firm First Health Advisory, told CNN. The Change Healthcare ransomware attack, in particular, has brought fresh attention from policymakers and experts on what many see as the over-consolidation of the US health care industry. If hackers can defeat security measures at one company, millions of patients who rely on that health network can be affected. \u201cUS healthcare is in a death spiral,\u201d said Corman, who co-founded I am the Cavalry, a volunteer group that focuses on cybersecurity for resource-poor organizations in the health sector, among others. \u201cDistressed hospitals get acquired into too-big-to-fail conglomerates. Ransoms cause distress for the little ones, and multi-week, multi-state outages for the ones \u2018saved\u2019 by the big ones.\u201d Any new cybersecurity regulations should be strong enough to force meaningful improvements in the sector\u2019s cybersecurity, Corman argued. \u2018Yes. cybersecurity is costly,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we can clearly see\u2026 neglect is more costly.\u201d Change Healthcare\u2019s parent firm, UnitedHealth Group, owns a significant portion of the US health care market. The company, which reported $371 billion in revenue last year, handles one in three American patient records,\u00a0according\u00a0to the American Hospital Association. Optum, a UnitedHealth subsidiary, employs about 90,000 physicians. \u201cYour revenues are bigger than some countries\u2019 GDP,\u201d Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican,\u00a0told\u00a0UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty in a Senate hearing this month.\u00a0\u201cAnd how in heaven\u2019s name did you not have the necessary redundancies so that you did not experience this attack and find yourself so vulnerable?\u201d The Justice Department has been pursuing an antitrust investigation into UnitedHealth Group, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0in February. More broadly, the Justice Department last week\u00a0announced\u00a0a\u00a0task force to examine \u201chealth care monopolies and collusion\u201d that will guide the department\u2019s approach to \u201ccivil and criminal enforcement in health care markets,\u201d where warranted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/tech/damaging-hacks-expose-the-weak-underbelly-of-americas-health-care-system/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_economy_ppi-wholesale-inflation-april", "text": "Americans already contending with persistent and stubbornly high inflation just got more unwelcome news on Tuesday: There are more price hikes likely coming down the pike. Wholesale inflation picked up in April to its highest rate in a year, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Tuesday. The Producer Price Index, which measures the change in prices that manufacturers pay to suppliers, was 2.2% for the 12 months ended in April, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Tuesday. That gain is higher than what was seen in March, which was downwardly revised from 2.1% to 1.8%. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.5%, a faster pace than March\u2019s 0.1% loss (also downwardly revised) and ran much hotter than what economists had anticipated. Economists were expecting a monthly gain of 0.3%, according to FactSet consensus estimates. \u201cThe concern here is that we now have a trend, an upward trend in producer prices, which can only be passed through to consumers and result in upward pressure on consumer price inflation over the coming months,\u201d Kurt Rankin, senior economist for the PNC Financial Services Group, told CNN in an interview. And that means interest rates will stay higher for longer and could further delay the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans for cuts on that front, he said. On Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said readings like the April PPI provide more justification to keep rates elevated for a longer period of time. But it does not necessarily mean the central bank will need to raise interest rates, Powell said while speaking at a Foreign Bankers Association event alongside European Central Bank Governing Council member Klaas Knot. Sticky, stubborn services inflation While higher energy costs (up 2% in April) helped to push goods prices higher, services inflation is what drove up the overall PPI last month. Nearly three-quarters of the April monthly gain was attributable to price hikes seen by producers of services, according to the report. Services providers saw a 0.6% increase in prices for the month, the fastest pace seen for that category since March 2022, Rankin noted. \u201cServices has been the issue over the past year as consumers continue to spend money, and costs for services-oriented businesses is still stronger than goods inflation; but goods producer prices are now also rising after having fallen through most of 2023,\u201d he said. PPI captures average price shifts before they reach consumers and serves as a potential bellwether for retail-level inflation in the months ahead. Although there was a welcome drop in food prices, which were down 0.7% for the month, April\u2019s data shows that activity upstream is looking quite a bit choppy. Even when excluding the volatile components of food and energy, \u201ccore\u201d PPI accelerated instead of slowing as economists had anticipated. The core index was up 2.4% for the 12 months ended in April \u2014 the highest annual rate since August of last year. On a monthly basis, core shot up 0.5% \u2014 well above estimates for a 0.2% increase. March\u2019s core PPI was revised down to show that prices fell 0.1% from March and rose 2.1% annually. \u201cToday\u2019s PPI number means inflation through June, July, August, is going to continue to have supply side pressure\u201d on businesses that deal more directly with consumers, Rankin said. \u201cNow those same businesses have their own costs to pass onto consumers, which compounds with continued strong consumer demand.\u201d The latest wholesale data is landing a day before an even more critical read on the state of inflation in the US: The Consumer Price Index for April will be released Wednesday morning.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/economy/ppi-wholesale-inflation-april/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

The 3,000-room resort will cease operations on July 17 as it undergoes a three-year renovation that wipes away any markings of the Mirage and its tropical theme. Opened in 1989 by casino mogul Steve Wynn, the Mirage ushered in a era of luxe resorts for the Strip and was the first resort to have a sidewalk attraction with its volcano, prompting the Bellagio and Venetian to imitate the Mirage with its dancing fountains and canals, respectively. \u201cWe look forward to the beginning of an exciting journey into a new era as Hard Rock Las Vegas will ignite the Strip with entertainment, innovation and world-class hospitality,\u201d the Mirage said on its Facebook account, which has been flooded with memories in the comments. In addition to the volcano, the Mirage was also home to other quintessential Las Vegas features like the Siegfried and Roy\u2019s white tigers show and a Cirque du Soleil show set to Beatles music. The resort will reopen in 2027 as Hard Rock Las Vegas, with a soaring 700-foot-tall hotel tower in the shape of a guitar, similar to its Florida property, with the volcano being destroyed to make space for new rooms. MGM Resorts bought the Mirage from Wynn in 2000 and sold it in 2022 for more than $1 billion to Hard Rock International. It\u2019s the second time Hard Rock will have a presence in Las Vegas, with the brand previously owning the now-Virgin Hotel off the Strip. More than 3,000 Mirage employees will be laid off beginning in July. The Hard Rock said it will pay more than $80 million in severance. The Culinary Workers Union, which represents about half of the Mirage\u2019s employees, said in a statement that affected workers will get $2,000 for each year of employment with the option of returning when the hotel reopens. Mirage guests that have reservations beyond July 14 will be cancelled and refunds issued. As for casino chips, they also need to be used by that date at the Mirage but can be redeemed at neighboring Treasure Island for another 120 days following the resort\u2019s closing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/business/mirage-las-vegas-closing/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Wall Street\u2019s artificial intelligence enthusiasts are expanding their horizons. The S&P 500\u2019s utility sector has gained 14% this year, making it the third-best-performing category behind information technology and communication services. The sector is also outpacing the benchmark index\u2019s 11% climb. Shares of Vistra have surged 152% this year, Constellation Energy shares have popped 91% and NRG Energy shares have gained 63%. That\u2019s a reversal from the sector\u2019s dour returns last year. Utility stocks tumbled more than 10% in 2023, underperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 24% gain, as investors betting on the artificial intelligence boom crowded into the Magnificent Seven big tech stocks. Wall Street also turned away from dividend-paying stocks, many of which are utilities, as high interest rates made bond yields the most attractive they have looked in years. This year, the playbook has changed. Big tech\u2019s market leadership has cracked. At the same time, investors are looking for cheaper alternatives to the Magnificent Seven, whose valuations reached lofty levels after last year\u2019s tech-driven monster stock rally. Enter utilities. These stocks are typically viewed as defensive plays, since people tend to prioritize paying for necessities like electricity over discretionary purchases when the economy is in rough shape. But investors are wagering this year that utilities companies will be key in building and running the infrastructure needed to service AI. The utilities sector currently trades at roughly 17 times its expected earnings over the next 12 months, below the S&P 500\u2019s multiple of about 21 and information technology\u2019s approximately 28 multiple. \u201cInvestors are now playing offense with utilities,\u201d wrote Bespoke Investment Group researchers in a Monday note. \u201cIt takes a lot of power to run AI, and coupled with demand for (electric vehicles) and modern day heating and cooling needs, our current grid seems woefully inadequate.\u201d A Google search requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours, according to the International Energy Agency. Factoring in that there are about 9 billion searches a day, nearly 10 terawatt-hours of additional electricity a year would be required if search engines fully implement AI. The agency predicts AI-related electricity demand will increase at least tenfold by 2026. Plus, utility stocks\u2019 defensive qualities have been attractive to investors who fear that the Federal Reserve will keep rates on hold after a spate of warm inflation data. While the April Consumer Price Index showed that prices cooled last month, investors expect the Fed will begin cutting rates in September at the earliest. To be sure, not everyone is jumping into utility stocks. Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, said that the company remains neutral on the sector despite recognizing it could have more upside. \u201cThe growth trajectory of a utility company is not comparable to these poster children of AI\u201d such as Nvidia and Super Micro Computer, wrote Turnquist in a May 9 note. US inflation slowed in April, providing a glimmer of hope for weary Americans After a hot start to 2024, inflation cooled back down in April, providing a bit of hope for Americans worn down by elevated prices, reports my colleague Alicia Wallace. Consumer prices were up 3.4% for the 12 months ended in April, easing from 3.5% the month before, according to the latest Consumer Price Index report released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.3%, a slower pace of growth than the 0.4% seen in the two months prior. Economists were expecting a 0.4% monthly increase and an annual gain of 3.4%, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Rising gasoline and shelter costs accounted for more than 70% of the monthly increase in overall inflation, according to the report. While elevated housing costs and high prices at the pump continue to weigh on Americans, Wednesday\u2019s report did provide some welcome news on another staple spending area: Grocery prices fell for the first time in a year, dropping 0.2% from March. A closely watched underlying measurement of inflation showed even more progress. Core CPI, which strips out the more volatile categories of energy and food, slowed from 3.8% to 3.6%, its lowest rate since April 2021. From the month before, core CPI ticked up by 0.3%, its slowest pace since the end of last year. Read more here. Taylor Swift\u2019s \u2018Eras Tour\u2019 could be worth almost $1 billion to British economy Taylor Swift\u2019s smash-hit \u201cEras Tour\u201d is set to boost spending in the United Kingdom by nearly $1 billion, according to estimates by Barclays. The British bank said in a report Wednesday that it expects nearly 1.2 million Swifties to attend the superstar\u2019s shows in the UK this summer, with the typical fan expected to spend \u00a3642 ($810) on travel, accommodation and other expenses \u2014 injecting a total of \u00a3755 million ($953 million) into the economy.

Swift will perform 15 shows across four UK cities in England, Wales and Scotland in June and August. The concerts sold out within minutes of tickets going on sale, with fans spending \u00a3206 ($260) on average on a single ticket, Barclays said. Including the ticket price, UK concertgoers will spend, on average, \u00a3848 ($1,068) each, which is more than 12 times the average cost of a night out in the UK, according to Barclays\u2019 research.

{"id": "2024_05_16_business_jamie-dimon-ray-dalio-us-government-debt", "text": "The chorus of voices warning about the dangers of record US government debt is growing louder. In the past 24 hours, JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon and Ray Dalio, founder of the world\u2019s biggest hedge fund, have weighed in with concerns about America\u2019s debt pile. In an interview with Sky News Wednesday, Dimon said he hoped the US government would focus on reducing its budget deficit \u2014 the difference between what it spends and what it receives in taxes each year \u2014 before financial markets force it to. \u201cThe sooner we focus on it, the better,\u201d Dimon added. \u201cAt one point, it will cause a problem\u2026 the problem will be caused by the market, and then you\u2019ll be forced to deal with it and probably in a far more uncomfortable way than if you dealt with it to start.\u201d Yawning deficits are adding to the overall level of US government debt because they require the Treasury to issue more bonds to plug the gap. Dalio said he was anxious about waning investor appetite for those government bonds, known as Treasuries. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 concerned about the softening demand to meet supply, particularly from international buyers worried about the US debt picture and possible sanctions (against countries other than Russia),\u201d he told the Financial Times. If investors become wary, they may demand higher returns \u2014 or yields \u2014 to own Treasuries \u2014 a risk already flagged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \u2014 and that in turn could mean higher borrowing costs across the US economy. The comments by Dimon and Dalio reflect widespread concerns about the broader risks of the huge US government debt burden, which the Treasury Department puts at $34.6 trillion, bigger than the size of the US economy. Dimon acknowledged that debt-fueled government spending, including pandemic stimulus, had been one of the reasons behind robust growth in the world\u2019s biggest economy. \u201cAmerica spent a lot of money, during Covid and after Covid. Our deficit (is at) 6% now, that\u2019s a lot, but obviously that drives growth,\u201d he said. The spending spree has also raised consumer price inflation. \u201cAny country can borrow money and drive some growth but it may not always lead to good growth, so I think America should be quite aware that we\u2019ve got to focus on our fiscal deficit issues a little bit more and that is important for the world,\u201d Dimon commented. Last month, the IMF said the high and rising level of US government debt risked driving up borrowing costs around the world and undermining global financial stability. That warning followed an even blunter message from the head of the CBO, the US Congress\u2019s independent fiscal watchdog, who said the United States risked a bond market crisis of the kind that engulfed the United Kingdom under former Prime Minister Liz Truss. In that instance, investors effectively rejected the UK government\u2019s plan to pay for extra spending and tax cuts by borrowing more money, leading to a selloff in UK government bonds. There is already some evidence that investors are demanding higher returns to hold US Treasuries, according to the IMF, partly as a result of their concerns about the debt trajectory. According to the Treasury Department, the federal government has so far spent $855 billion more than it has collected in the 2024 fiscal year, which began on October 1. Debt servicing costs have also soared, on the back of higher official interest rates, leaving less money for public services. In fiscal year 2023, the US government spent more to service its debt than it did on each of housing, transport and higher education, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a non-profit. The United States is far from alone in increasingly living beyond its means. The European Central Bank expects government debt in the 20 countries that use the euro to stay higher than before the pandemic. This will make European governments \u201cmore vulnerable to adverse shocks,\u201d such as growing geopolitical tensions if they require more spending on defense, it said in a report Thursday.

{"id": "2024_05_14_tech_aws-ceo-adam-selipsky-steps-down", "text": "Amazon\u2019s biggest moneymaker, Amazon Web Services, is getting a new leader. Adam Selipsky, the chief executive of the cloud computing unit, will step down from his role next month, the company announced Tuesday. Selipsky, who first joined AWS in 2005 \u2014 before its services were even publicly available \u2014 has led the business since 2021, when previous AWS CEO Andy Jassy was promoted to lead all of Amazon. Matt Garman, currently vice president of sales, marketing and global services, will take over as AWS CEO starting June 3. The leader of AWS is of major consequence to the larger company, as the cloud computing business makes up nearly two-thirds of Amazon\u2019s overall profits. And with annual revenue of more than $90 billion last year, AWS is larger than many standalone companies. AWS is also at a pivotal moment with the growth of artificial intelligence, as it rolls out new tools and capacity in hopes of becoming the computing provider of choice for the next wave of technology. But it faces fierce competition from other major players, including Google Cloud and Microsoft\u00a0Azure. Amazon Web Services\u2019 sales have grown more than 85% since Selipsky\u2019s takeover. Amazon shares dipped more than 1% Tuesday following the announcement. However, Jassy said in an email to staff Tuesday that Selipsky\u2019s tenure was always meant to be short-lived. Jassy said that when he left AWS to become Amazon CEO, \u201cwe had strong leaders in AWS, several of whom could lead the overall business in the long-term, but who\u2019d benefit from a few more years gaining experience and learning under a more seasoned CEO.\u201d He added that in speaking with Selipsky about taking the job back in 2021, \u201cwe agreed that if he accepted the role, he\u2019d likely do it for a few years, and that one of the things he\u2019d focus on during that time was helping prepare the next generation of leadership. We were fortunate that Adam agreed to step in and lead AWS, and has deftly led the business, while also developing his leadership team,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cI\u2019m humbled by the many customers who have said they wouldn\u2019t be what they are without AWS, thankful to our many partners, and grateful to my passionate and innovative teammates. AWS will be in great hands with Matt and the incredible leadership team,\u201d Selipsky said in a post on X Tuesday. Even before Selipsky\u2019s takeover, Garman had been considered by analysts to be among the top frontrunners for AWS CEO. Garman started at Amazon as an intern in 2005, and joined full-time in 2006 as one of the first AWS product managers, according to the company. He later became general manager of AWS Compute services, before moving to lead the sales side of the business.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/tech/aws-ceo-adam-selipsky-steps-down/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can \u201clisten\u201d to people\u2019s questions and converse in real time. \u201cShellie\u201d can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while \u201cArif\u201d is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_media_netflix-cable-bundle-news", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Netflix\u00a0is rebuilding the cable bundle, sans one important ingredient: news. The company, having blown up the decades-old linear television business and ushered in the costly and destabilizing era of streaming, is inching closer and closer to resembling the entertainment behemoths of yesteryear. Netflix has added advertisements to its plans, a move it initially resisted for several years, touting more than 40 million subscribers to the ad-supported tier on Wednesday. It has added live late-night comedy, most recently with the roast of\u00a0Tom Brady\u00a0and\u00a0John Mulaney\u2019s \u201cEverybody\u2019s In L.A.\u201d\u00a0And it has made great strides into the live-sports arena, despite public statements asserting it does not wish to wade far into such waters. On Wednesday, the streaming giant announced that it had struck a groundbreaking deal with the\u00a0NFL\u00a0to broadcast not one, but two games on\u00a0Christmas Day\u00a0this year. Those games add to the company\u2019s ever-growing portfolio of live-sports offerings, including\u00a0WWE \u201cRaw,\u201d\u00a0which will air exclusively on the platform starting next year. \u201cLast year, we decided to take a big bet on live \u2014 tapping into massive fandoms across comedy, reality TV, sports and more,\u201d\u00a0Bela Bajaria, Netflix chief content officer, said in a statement explaining the decision. Notably absent from Bajaria\u2019s statement and the company\u2019s programming strategy, however, is news. Netflix has shown little-to-no interest in investing in either live-news or pre-taped programming (a la, a show akin to\u00a0\u201cVice News Tonight\u201d\u00a0or\u00a0\u201c60 Minutes\u201d). To date, it has neither publicly discussed nor launched any such projects. And in conversations with talent agents, it has made clear that the streamer has no interest in even dabbling in the news business. \u201cThe entertainment platforms are not interested in news,\u201d one talent agent, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told me. \u201cTheir audiences don\u2019t want it and it can be polarizing. It\u2019s just not worth it for them.\u201d In actively avoiding the news, Netflix joins\u00a0Meta\u00a0as a pioneering technology and media company that has upended the business models news organizations have relied on for decades, only to turn its back on the industry. To be fair to these companies, there are plenty of business reasons to avoid dabbling in the news. First, news reporting is simply not as popular as entertainment content. Second, and perhaps more importantly for these companies, news has become incredibly polarizing in recent years. Simply stating that the 2020 presidential election was not stolen \u2014\u00a0a proven fact\u00a0\u2014 alienates Republicans. That polarizing factor means that not only is it more difficult to sell advertisements around the content, but that by carrying such programming, there is a chance a swath of the customer base will be turned off by the brand and motivated to unsubscribe. Which is all to say that Netflix investing in news programming would translate into spending money on content that is not as popular as other genres, but far more risky to the overall business. From a purely business standpoint, avoiding that type of programming make sense. Of course, the counterargument is that these companies perhaps have a civic responsibility to invest in news and public affairs programming \u2014 especially since they contributed greatly to the destruction of the business model that had supported television newsrooms for so long. Journalists are crucial to thriving democracies and the hollowing out of the news industry has vast implications for the future of the free world. It\u2019s anything but unprecedented for large media companies to invest money in journalism.\u00a0Warner Bros. Discovery\u00a0has\u00a0CNN.\u00a0Comcast\u00a0has\u00a0NBC News.\u00a0Disney\u00a0has\u00a0ABC News.\u00a0Paramount\u00a0has\u00a0CBS News.\u00a0The list goes on. And, back when cable was ascendant and disruptive, as Netflix is today, the major carriers financed the birth of\u00a0C-SPAN,\u00a0offering the public a continuous feed of its government at work. So, is it really out of the question to wonder whether a streamer like Netflix should consider a similar move to offer news programming that informs and enriches the public? Rebuilding the traditional cable package without news is akin to putting together a meal that includes steak, potatoes and ice cream, but not the broccoli. The vegetables might not be the tastiest, most popular item on the menu, but neglecting them would not be healthy. Likewise, only investing in comedy and sports might be more satisfying for its audience, but it certainly isn\u2019t a healthy choice for society. That is the destination, though, where the current decisions are leading. And as the streaming revolution continues to take the wind out of the traditional cable bundle by poaching the rights to live sports, the once-towering television news outlets will be further diminished, turning the situation even more dire.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/media/netflix-cable-bundle-news/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_15_business_china-russia-ties-ukraine-war-intl-hnk-dg", "text": "As countries around the world ramped up sanctions on Russia in the wake of Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it became clear that the Russian president still had a powerful friend in Xi Jinping. The Chinese leader, who declared a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership with Russia weeks before the full-scale invasion, set a policy of decrying sanctions and continuing to strengthen ties with Putin. On Thursday, Xi welcomed the Russian president to China for a two-day state visit \u2014 their fourth in-person meeting since Russia\u2019s onslaught in Ukraine began. The war has driven the two leaders and their economies closer together \u2014 with trade hitting record levels last year as Russia upped its imports of key commodities from China and Chinese buyers lapped up discounted Russian fuel. The United States has said Chinese exports of products like machine tools and microelectronics are enabling Russia to bolster the defense industrial base powering its war in Ukraine, and official data show hefty increases of related goods that are consistent with those claims. China has repeatedly\u00a0defended its trade\u00a0with Russia as part of normal bilateral relations. It also says it maintains a neutral position on the war and plays no other role than seeking peace. Here\u2019s how the two sides have upgraded their ties since February 2022. Sanctions\u00a0drive economies closer The European Union, the US and many of its allies and others across the world have imposed a range of sanctions targeting Russian entities and the flow of goods to and from the warring country. Those have included efforts to limit its revenue from key exports like fuel, as well as its access to technologies and goods with military applications. Despite these efforts to isolate Putin\u2019s government and reduce its war coffers, Russia\u2019s economy blew past expectations to grow by 3.6% in 2023, according to data from the International Monetary Fund. That followed a contraction in 2022, according to Russian state media. The sanctions have caused a sweeping shift in who Russia trades with \u2014 and China has emerged as a key economic lifeline, greatly expanding trade ties with its northern neighbor.\u00a0The two countries last year racked up $240 billion in bilateral trade, hitting a target to exceed $200 billion in two-way trade by 2024 ahead of schedule \u2014 a feat lauded by both Putin and Xi. That\u2019s driven China to rank as Russia\u2019s top trade partner, Putin declared last year, with his presidential aide later confirming to Russian state media that the country\u00a0had surpassed the EU to take that spot. As the EU slashed purchases of Russian fuel and limited exports ranging from high-tech goods to transportation equipment, China bolstered its own exports of\u00a0industrial and commercial goods to the country, such as vehicles, machinery and home appliances, data and official statements show. Russia has also become China\u2019s main oil supplier, overtaking Saudi Arabia, according to official Chinese trade data. China, however, is not alone in taking advantage of Russia\u2019s need to find new markets for its fuel, with India also among buyers upping imports in the wake of the war. Governments warn against support for Russia\u2019s war effort The wartime surge in trade, and growing purchases of oil, have sparked criticism in the West that China was helping to fund Russia\u2019s war. Western governments and independent analysts also raised alarm that dual-use goods with potential military applications are part of these surging imports. White House officials in recent weeks have confronted China on what they believe is Beijing\u2019s substantial support for Russia\u2019s defense industrial base, including through exports like semiconductors, materials and machine tools they say are enabling Russia to ramp up production of tanks, munitions and armored vehicles. In a visit to Beijing late last month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Chinese leaders that the US and other countries would act if Beijing didn\u2019t move to stem this flow. French President Emmanuel Macron and his European Commission counterpart Ursula von der Leyen also pressed Xi on such supplies during the leader\u2019s state visit to France last week, with Von der Leyen saying after the meeting that \u201cmore effort is needed to curtail delivery of dual-use goods to Russia that find their way to the battlefield.\u201d Beijing has previously slammed the US as making \u201cgroundless accusations\u201d over \u201cnormal trade and economic exchanges\u201d between China and Russia. But analysts have pointed to nascent, potential signs that China may be seeking to dial down such imports \u2014 with China\u2019s monthly exports to Russia declining in both March and April compared with the same periods in 2023, according to official Chinese customs data. Putin and Xi\u2019s high-level friendship Xi and Putin\u2019s relationship has also appeared to strengthen as both leaders consolidated power,\u00a0rewriting\u00a0previous term limits in recent years to extend their\u00a0respective lengthy rules. The war has not changed that dynamic. Putin\u2019s overseas travel has declined since the outbreak of the conflict, but this trip marks his second to China since the invasion and the two leaders\u2019 fourth in-person meeting in that time. Xi has made a single known phone call to Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky during that period and met US President Joe Biden in person twice on the sidelines of international summits since Biden took office in 2021. Xi and Putin have a history of marking milestones together. This week\u2019s visit is Putin\u2019s symbolic first international trip since starting a fifth term in office following his victory in a tightly controlled election in March. It mirrors Xi\u2019s state visit to Russia in March 2023, which was the Chinese leader\u2019s first overseas trip after starting a norm-shattering third term as president.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/business/china-russia-ties-ukraine-war-intl-hnk-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_media_youtube-glory-to-hong-kong-intl-hnk", "text": "YouTube has blocked access to a popular protest song in Hong Kong, a week after a court in the city granted a government request to ban the anthem. In a statement on Wednesday, YouTube said 32 web links playing \u201cGlory to Hong Kong\u201d have been geoblocked and are now unavailable in the semi autonomous Chinese city following a court order. Attempts to access the videos, which include instrumental and sign language versions of the song, from Hong Kong yielded messages such as \u201cThis content is not available on this country domain due to a court order\u201d or \u201cThis video isn\u2019t available anymore.\u201d \u201cWe are disappointed by the Court\u2019s decision but are complying with its removal order by blocking access to the listed videos for viewers in Hong Kong. We\u2019ll continue to consider our options for an appeal, to promote access to information,\u201d a YouTube spokesperson said in an emailed reply to CNN. Google (GOOGL), which owns Youtube, told CNN in an emailed reply last week that \u201cit is reviewing the court\u2019s judgment.\u201d CNN has also reached out to Meta (META) \u2014 which owns\u00a0Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram\u00a0\u2014 and Spotify (SPOT). \u201cGlory to Hong Kong\u201d was composed by a musician under a pseudonym in August 2019 and became the unofficial anthem of pro-democracy protests. The authorities have long taken issue with what they say is the song\u2019s separatist undertones. The ballad contains lyrics that reference the phrase \u201cliberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times,\u201d a protest slogan that was already\u00a0outlawed\u00a0in 2020. The Hong Kong government and courts had said the phrase had secessionist and subversive connotations. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters Wednesday that \u201cpreventing anyone from using and disseminating relevant songs with the intention of inciting secession and insulting the national anthem is a legitimate and necessary measure\u201d for Hong Kong \u201cto fulfil its responsibilities of safeguarding national security and the dignity of the national anthem.\u201d The Asia Internet Coalition, which counts Spotify and Meta as members, said it is \u201cassessing the implications of the decision,\u201d including how the injunction will be implemented, to determine its impact on businesses. \u201cWe believe that a free and open internet is fundamental to the city\u2019s ambitions to become an international technology and innovation hub,\u201d said Jeff Paine, the group\u2019s managing director. A Hong Kong government spokesperson said \u201cfreedoms are not absolute\u201d. Over the past two years, \u201cGlory to Hong Kong\u201d has been mistakenly played at international sporting events involving Hong Kong teams, instead of China\u2019s national anthem \u201cMarch of the Volunteers.\u201d Pro-Beijing politicians and officials, including the city\u2019s justice minister, Paul Lam, have mostly blamed Google\u2019s algorithm for letting the song come up at the top of searches. Last June, Hong Kong\u2019s Department of Justice filed a court injunction to seek a ban on the broadcasting or distribution of the song. The injunction was initially rejected but was overturned last week following an appeal. Hong Kong was promised key freedoms and autonomy to run its own affairs after it was handed over from British rule to China in 1997.\u00a0As a result, it had flourished as a bastion of free speech and creative expression within authoritarian China. But a crackdown on dissent in the aftermath of the democracy protests has since transformed the city, especially after a\u00a0sweeping national security law\u00a0was imposed by Beijing in 2020. This year, a second local security bill, known as Article 23, was passed targets seditious acts, espionage and foreign interference. China and Hong Kong\u2019s leaders say the laws are needed as part of their drive to \u201crestore stability\u201d following huge and often violent democracy protests in 2019 and argue their legislation is similar to other national security laws around the world.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/media/youtube-glory-to-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_economy_household-debt-credit-q1-delinquencies", "text": "The economy has been resilient, the job market healthy and consumers keep spending, but more Americans are becoming financially overextended \u2014 especially on their credit cards. New data released Tuesday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed that as household debt balances grew during the first quarter, delinquencies also marched higher. Notably, the percentage of credit card balances in serious delinquency (90 days or more late) climbed to its highest level since 2012. \u201cIn the first quarter of 2024, credit card and auto loan transition rates into serious delinquency continued to rise across all age groups,\u201d Joelle Scally, regional economic principal within the Household and Public Policy Research Division at the New York Fed, said in a statement. \u201cAn increasing number of borrowers missed credit card payments, revealing worsening financial distress among some households.\u201d Aggregate delinquency rates increased during the first quarter to 3.2% of outstanding debt in some stage of delinquency, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2020, according to the New York Fed\u2019s latest Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit. The transitions into delinquency \u2014 especially serious delinquency \u2014 increased across all debt types, according to the report. Delinquencies fell to historic lows during the pandemic as consumers spent less during the health and safety lockdowns and were able to build up savings and pay off debt with those funds and economic stimulus payments. However, as supply chain and spending imbalances fueled domestic and global inflation \u2014 and subsequently a rise of interest rates \u2014 delinquencies have moved higher in recent years. While the delinquency transition rates remain below what was seen during the Great Recession, they\u2019re running higher than what was seen pre-pandemic. Because of that, New York Fed researchers said they\u2019re keeping a close watch on what this means for the well-being of Americans\u2019 household finances and the overall economy. Overall household debt grew by 1.1% during the first quarter to $17.69 trillion, according to data that is not adjusted for inflation. The quarterly increase was driven largely by mortgage balances. Credit card balances dipped (as they typically do post-holidays) by $14 billion to $1.12 trillion. However, when adjusting for inflation, balances have yet to surpass the levels seen in 2008. Higher balances can be attributed to population growth, an increase in\u00a0online spending,\u00a0the surging cost of new and used cars, as well as\u00a0economy-powering consumer\u00a0activity.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/economy/household-debt-credit-q1-delinquencies/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
