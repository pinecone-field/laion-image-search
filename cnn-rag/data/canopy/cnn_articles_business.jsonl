You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. It\u2019s been smooth sailing for stocks in 2024. The S&P 500 has gained nearly 15% and has been on a steady upward trend for the past two months. Treasuries have been more volatile, thrown around by the swings in inflation data, hints about future policy decisions from Federal Reserve officials and higher-for-longer interest rates. But following a spike in yields in April and May, they\u2019ve calmed a little and should end the first half nearly even. The relatively benign picture for investors could be about to change, however. The Fed is preparing markets for the possibility that there could be no rate cuts this year. Add to that the noise surrounding the US election, and it could be a rougher second half. Fed foibles: Treasury yields, which go up as prices fall, have moved higher this week as investors reacted to comments from Fed officials downplaying interest rate cut expectations. On Tuesday, Fed governor Michelle Bowman said that she\u2019s expecting no rate cuts this year. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said Monday the Fed must be agile and \u201cif inflation falls more slowly than expected, the policy rate must stay higher for longer.\u201d Meanwhile, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee was also particularly hawkish in his views, saying Monday that he would need to see \u201cmore months\u201d of weaker inflation data to even begin to consider cutting rates. Recent data is also spooking investors. Central Banks in Canada and the eurozone have both cut interest rates, but inflation rose in both of those regions last month. Australia, meanwhile, saw its inflation rate rise to 4% this week, stoking fears that the Reserve Bank of Australia could soon move to raise rates again. Debt, deficits and debates: The unknowns of the current election cycle have also thrown investors for a loop \u2013\u2014 especially since neither President Joe Biden nor former President Donald Trump has indicated they plan to rein in the yawning budget deficit. \u201cWith rates back on the upswing due to international price pressure concerns, an important consideration will be whether government debt, deficits and issuance will begin to matter again,\u201d said Jos\u00e9\u00a0Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.. As debt goes up, investors often require a higher payout to purchase long-term Treasuries. That could also impact markets. The last 10% correction in stocks occurred as the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5% in October, Torres noted. Earlier this week, 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists warned in an open letter that a second Trump administration wouldn\u2019t just fail to fix inflation \u2014 it would make matters worse. The letter, organized by famed economist Joseph Stiglitz, argued there are valid reasons to worry the Trump agenda will \u201creignite\u201d inflation. In particular, the economists point to Trump\u2019s \u201cfiscally irresponsible budgets\u201d and nonpartisan research from the likes of the Peterson Institute, Oxford Economics and Allianz that finds the Trump agenda \u2014 if successfully enacted \u2014 would increase inflation. What it means: For American consumers, a rising 10-year Treasury yield means more economic pain: expensive car loans, higher credit card rates and even more expensive student debt. It also means that the cost of mortgages could increase. When 10-year Treasury yields go up, so do mortgage rates; when they go down, mortgage rates tend to follow. What comes next: Investors are awaiting key economic data this week. The Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, is out on Friday. That will provide investors with more information about economic forecasts and potential interest rate cuts. The US presidential debate is being hosted by CNN Thursday evening. Boeing blames missing paperwork for Alaska Air incident, prompting NTSB rebuke The missing paperwork on the 737 Max that lost a door plug on an Alaska Airlines flight in January made it difficult to find out who made the near tragic mistake. The paperwork may have also caused the problem in the first place, Boeing disclosed this week. It was already well known that no documentation was found to show who worked on the door plug. What was disclosed this week at a briefing for journalists at Boeing\u2019s 737 Max factory in Renton, Washington, is that lack of paperwork is why the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place were never installed before the plane left the factory in October. The workers who needed to reinstall the bolts never had the work order telling them the work needed to be done. Without the bolts, the door plug incident was pretty much inevitable. Luckily, it wasn\u2019t fatal. It\u2019s a sign of the problems with the quality of work along the Boeing assembly lines. Those problems have become the focus of multiple federal investigations and whistleblower revelations, and the cause of delays in jet deliveries that are causing headaches for airlines and passengers around the globe. But Boeing may have landed itself in even more trouble with regulators for divulging the details at this stage.\u00a0The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reprimanded Boeing Thursday for releasing \u201cnon-public investigative information\u201d to the media. It said in a statement that the company had \u201cblatantly violated\u201d the agency\u2019s rules. During the Tuesday briefing, Boeing said that the particular problem with the Alaska Air door plug occurred because two different groups of employees at the plant were charged with doing the work, with one removing and the other reinstalling the door plug as the plane was passing along the assembly line.

NBC to use AI version of announcer Al Michaels\u2019 voice for Olympics recaps NBC is bringing a version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the\u00a0Olympics this summer\u00a0with an unlikely twist: His voice will be powered by artificial intelligence. NBC announced on Wednesday it will use AI software to recreate Michaels\u2019 voice to deliver daily recaps of the Summer Games for subscribers of its Peacock streaming platform, a milestone for the use of AI by a major media company. The use of an AI voice for the Olympics comes as the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, sound and text. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries, such as journalism, about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. A new tool, called \u201cYour Daily Olympic Recap on Peacock,\u201d will enable 10-minute highlights packages, which can include events updates, athlete back stories and other related content personalized by\u00a0subscriber preferences. The company said the highlights could be packaged in about 7 million different ways, pulled from 5,000 hours of live coverage in Paris, effectively making AI (the artificial intelligence, not the man)\u00a0a significantly more efficient way to deliver personalized recaps. \u201cWhen I was approached about this, I was skeptical but obviously curious,\u201d Michaels said in a press release. \u201cThen I saw a demonstration detailing what they had in mind. I said, \u2018I\u2019m in.\u2019\u201d A NBC spokesperson told CNN Michaels is being compensated for his involvement.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

You\u2019ll have better luck if you\u2019re an American Express cardholder and pay the requisite hundreds of dollars in fees. American Express announced last week that it\u2019s buying Tock, a booking app for around 7,000 restaurants, bars and other venues, for $400 million. American Express already owns Resy, a rival restaurant booking app, and gives special table access to Amex customers that are not available to other customers. American Express Platinum cardholders ($695 annual fee) and Delta SkyMiles Reserve customers ($650 a year) receive exclusive reservations at hard-to-get restaurants and first dibs when cancellations pop up. Rajesh Bhardwaj, the owner of\u00a0Junoon in New York City \u2014 one of the first Indian restaurants in the United States to earn a Michelin star \u2014 and other restaurants, said that Amex has helped his eateries connect with new customers and develop events and curated menus to target specific Amex customers. \u201cIt\u2019s good news for restaurants,\u201d he said of Amex\u2019s involvement in Resy and now Tock. But experts say that Amex\u2019s acquisition gives the credit card company more control over velvet rope access to dinner \u2014 and who is shut out. People who don\u2019t have Amex cards could have a harder time landing reservations. Reservations at hot restaurants have become nearly impossible to snag in major cities in recent years, in part due to social media and the rise of food influencers and websites. Bots, table resellers and \u201cprivate reservationists\u201d have emerged to help deep-pocketed customers secure tables. New York recently passed legislation cracking down on the black market reservation system. Businesses have long segmented customers based on loyalty or how much they spend, and there have always been VIPs and special perks for customers who pay more: orchestra seats at theaters, boxes at stadiums and first class seats on airlines. But it\u2019s been turbocharged in recent years thanks to new technology, like online booking software and targeted mobile advertising, and sophisticated data and analytics on customer behavior. Credit card companies such as Amex are increasingly dangling exclusive perks in hospitality and leisure for their cardholders, such as pre-sale tickets for concerts and access to airport lounges. A credit card company using its leverage over who can sit down at a restaurant is the next step in segmenting customers based on how much they are able or willing to spend, hospitality experts say. Amex\u2019s move marks companies\u2019 \u201ccontinued tiering of the consumer,\u201d Joseph Nunes, a marketing professor at the University of Southern California, said in an email. \u201cBy locking in who gets what place in the queue (or has access) to high-demand restaurants, Amex gets in on a new form of status and makes their card a must have.\u201d For restaurants, Amex\u2019s move is a mixed bag. It may help restaurants attract Amex customers with deeper wallets, said Alex Susskind, a professor of food and beverage management at Cornell University. But, in turn, Amex becomes the middleman between customers and restaurants. Restaurant owners and merchants have also complained about the fees credit card companies charge businesses, and it could open a new door for fees. \u201cAmerican Express is the broker and they control the relationship,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/business/american-express-resy-tock/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can \u201clisten\u201d to people\u2019s questions and converse in real time. \u201cShellie\u201d can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while \u201cArif\u201d is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_media_nyt-strands-game-launch", "text": "Following the success of Connections and Wordle, the pressure was on for the New York Times to find its next hit game. It didn\u2019t have to look far. Strands, a word search game, is officially joining the newspaper\u2019s portfolio of games Friday following a four-month testing phase in which it garnered millions of players despite being practically hidden. The puzzle marks the latest in a string of successes for Times\u2019 Games section, which has helped grow the paper\u2019s subscription business and bolster its bottom line in an era of declining advertising revenue. During the testing phase, Strands was only playable on the web or via links from its other games. Now that it\u2019s exiting beta testing, it will soon be added to the Times\u2019 Games app, exposing it to millions of new players and joining the app\u2019s collection of ten games, which also includes the Crossword, Spelling Bee and Sudoku. \u201cStrands got very big, very quickly. It was a little bigger than we were ready for in the first few days,\u201d admitted Jonathan Knight, head of Games at the Times. That\u2019s partly because of the sustaining popularity of Connections, which was the second-biggest referrer to Strands behind people searching for it, and still has millions of players. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the new games build on each other, so that\u2019s really exciting as our audience has grown pretty significantly over the past couple of few years,\u201d he told CNN. What is Strands? Strands, like Connections, was recently hatched at a \u201cGame Jam\u201d\u00a0(think: a hackathon, but for games) and filled the need for a word search-type of game in the app. It \u201cbubbled up as a version of a word search that was true to the New York Times\u2019 games,\u201d Knight said. The Times\u2019 research of its subscribers found that Wordle players also solve word search games, making Strands a natural addition to its lineup. Notably, Strands also shares the same editor of Wordle \u2014 Tracy Bennett \u2014 who, along with her team of editors and testers, craft the daily puzzles. Strands is organized by a 6-by-8 grid of seemingly random letters with a category hint on the top. Players have to find several words relating to the theme. However, the Times\u2019 twist is that they also have to find the \u201cspanagram,\u201d which describes what all the words have in common. Knight suggests players to start at the corners of the puzzle and look for obvious words there. \u201cIf you get a toehold in the corner, you begin the process of filling out the whole board and it flows from there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a rush of accomplishment at the end.\u201d The solve rate is \u201cfairly high\u201d at 81% for Strands because of the hints that players get if they guess three words with at least four letters that aren\u2019t part of the theme. That\u2019s another part of the game, Knight said, because it challenges some people not to use the hints. \u201cIt should be really solvable for most people on most days,\u201d he said, especially compared to Connections, which is \u201cdeliberately a lot trickier.\u201d The easiness of Strands is part of the Games\u2019 strategy to have an \u201coverall range of puzzles for people to choose from that can be easier on one end and trickier on the other end,\u201d Knight added. He noted that Wordle still remains its most popular game and was played 4.8 billion times last year. Growth of games Games and Times\u2019 other apps like Cooking have been an essential part of the Times\u2019 strategy to boost revenue beyond advertising. Revenue from digital subscriptions crossed $1 billion for the first time in 2023. The Times currently has 10.6 million digital-only subscribers and its games have been played more than 8 billion times last year, according to its annual report. Games has helped the Times grow because news is a \u201ccrowded category and the market for subscriptions is limited, largely by ideology, and advertising against news is a declining market,\u201d Brian Morrissey, author of the Rebooting, a media newsletter, previously told CNN. The Times\u2019 success has prompted other companies, such as LinkedIn and Hearst, to take notice and start creating their own games. \u201cGames have proven a powerful way to acquire new customers that might be open to a bundle with news but who otherwise wouldn\u2019t subscribe to just news,\u201d Morrissey added. Times\u2019 Games app lets people play some puzzles, like Wordle and Strands, for free. Full access, which includes the Crossword, a few other games and archives, costs $6 per month. The recently redesigned app has been downloaded 21 million times globally since 2019, according to Sensor Tower data, with the number of downloads soaring 113% last year. Growth continued in 2024, with the number of downloads growing 165% in the first quarter of the year compared to the same time period a year prior, the market intelligence firm told CNN. But with that success does come with some stress for Knight and his team to find the next, Wordle, Connections or even Strands. \u201cThe bar is high now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a number of high-quality games in the app. As we go forward, we\u2019re certainly not done and we think there\u2019s room for more games, but we\u2019re being even more thoughtful than ever.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/media/nyt-strands-game-launch/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_media_hunter-biden-sues-fox-news", "text": "Hunter Biden has sued Fox News and its parent corporation, accusing the right-wing network of smearing him and unlawfully publishing his explicit images without his consent in a 2022 miniseries about his legal troubles. In the lawsuit, filed Sunday in New York state court, the president\u2019s sonaccuses Fox News of unjust enrichment, intentionally inflicting emotional distress, and violating New York civil rights laws. The lawsuit makes good on\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s threat he made in April that he would take the network to court if it didn\u2019t immediately issue retractions and corrections. The miniseries, \u201cThe Trial of Hunter Biden,\u201d was a six-part offering on the Fox Nation digital streaming network, and was also promoted on Fox News, the cable TV channel. It featured a dramatized \u201cmock trial\u201d about Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas financial dealings that led in part to his federal tax indictment and that also fueled House Republicans\u2019 struggling impeachment inquiry into his father. Fox News\u00a0took down the miniseries\u00a0in late April, one day after Hunter Biden threatened to file a lawsuit. But according to the lawsuit, promotional materials for the miniseries are still on some Fox News-linked social media pages, and the miniseries episodes are still circulating \u201conline and in the public domain.\u201d A Fox News spokesperson claimed the lawsuit was meritless and \u201centirely politically motivated,\u201d and said the network looks forward to \u201cvindicating our rights in court.\u201d \u201cThe core complaint stems from a 2022 streaming program that Mr. Biden did not complain about until sending a letter in late April 2024,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe program was removed within days of the letter, in an abundance of caution, but Hunter Biden is a public figure who has been the subject of multiple investigations and is now a convicted felon. Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden\u2019s own making.\u201d The new lawsuit claims Fox News \u201ctargeted Mr. (Hunter) Biden in an effort to harass, annoy, alarm, and humiliate him, and tarnish his reputation.\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s son is seeking an unspecified amount of punitive damages, as well as any profits that Fox reaped from the miniseries, and other corrective measures. \u201cThe miniseries is fictionalized; it is not a news event. It was made for the purpose of trade and advertising, and merely exploits Mr. Biden\u2019s name, image, and likeness for Fox\u2019s commercial benefit,\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers wrote in the lawsuit. Hunter Biden\u2019s team said in the lawsuit that without his consent, Fox News \u201cunlawfully published numerous intimate images (both still and video) of Mr. Biden depicting him in the nude, depicting an unclothed or exposed intimate part of him, as well as engaged in sex acts.\u201d The right-wing network said these images originated form Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0infamous laptop\u00a0\u2013 data from which was leaked by allies for former President Donald Trump in 2020. The president\u2019s son was\u00a0convicted at a trial\u00a0last month on federal gun charges, and faces a second trial this fall on alleged tax crimes. However, he hasn\u2019t been charged in connection with the bribery and foreign lobbying allegations that were at the center of Fox\u2019s \u201cmock trial\u201d series.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/media/hunter-biden-sues-fox-news/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

Until the film\u2019s release on June 16, domestic sales had been lagging more than 25% behind 2023\u2019s performance, according to Comscore data. \u201cOver the past few weeks, we\u2019ve seen the year-to-date, year-over-year domestic box office revenue deficit shrink from 27% to 19% and that\u2019s due in large part to the amazing and much welcome performance of \u2018Inside Out 2,\u2019 a film that has adjusted the mood of the movie industry in just a few short weeks,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. The movie is the highest grossing film of the year, and the first to pass $1 billion since \u201cBarbie,\u201d which came out last July. It also joins the ranks of eight other Disney and Pixar movies grossing more than a $1 billion, including \u201cThe Incredibles 2,\u201d \u201cFinding Dory,\u201d both \u201cFrozen\u201d movies and the final two \u201cToy Story\u201d installments. Daniel Loria, editorial director at Box Office Pro, which collects sales and showtime\u00a0data from thousands of movie theaters across the United States, projects this year will see an overall domestic box office total between $8.1 billion and $8.4 billion, down from 2023\u2019s total of more than $9 billion, the highest since the pandemic. But Loria notes it is still possible to close the gap further. \u201cThe impact of the strike on the box office is clear in the first five months of the year, but June has shown us the crucial role movie theaters play in a film industry firing on all cylinders,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cIf the movies are there, the audience will follow. I expect to see great numbers in the second half of the year, leading into 2025 and beyond. Another surprise hit or two, and we may get a lot closer\u00a0to matching that $9 billion than we all expected coming into the year.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/business/inside-out-2-global-box-office/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_economy_wealthy-economy-inflation", "text": "About one in three Americans making six-figure salaries are worried about paying their bills, according to a new survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The survey finds a notable increase over the past year of consumers making $100,000 a year or more who are concerned about making ends meet over the next 12 months. A significant share of wealthier Americans are coping with financial pressure by cutting spending, including dialing back restaurant visits and entertainment. The findings underscore how years of high inflation and elevated borrowing costs continue to squeeze consumers\u2019 budgets \u2014 even f\ufeffor those at the higher end of the income spectrum. Nearly a third (30.8%) of consumers making between $100,000 and $149,999 a year are concerned about making ends meet in the next six months, according to the Philly Fed survey, which was fielded from March 22 to April 6. That\u2019s up from 21.3% of Americans in that income bracket concerned about making ends meet a year earlier. Similarly, 32.5% of those earning $150,000 or more indicated they are concerned about paying the bills, up from 21.7% a year earlier. Those more affluent Americans are more concerned than the 23% of those making $70,000 to $99,999, according to the survey. Among all consumers, about one in three (34.9%) said they are concerned about making ends meet, up from 28.7% a year earlier. Younger Americans are more likely to be feeling the financial pressure than older. Forty-one percent of those between 18 and 35 years old said they are concerned about making ends meet, compared with just 22% of those over 65. There was also a notable increase in higher-earning consumers nervous about paying bills in the longer run. For instance, 32.3% of those making $100,000 to $149,999 said they are concerned about making ends meet in the next seven to 12 months, up from 26.5% a year ago. There was an even bigger increase among those making at least $150,000, with 33% saying they are concerned, up from 19.8% a year ago. The Philly Fed survey found a \u201clarge and significant\u201d increase in the past year of people who are currently able to pay their bills but are concerned they won\u2019t be able to in the next six months. That increased from 20.7% a year ago to 26.2%. The mood wasn\u2019t all gloomy, however. A growing share of wealthier consumers expect higher incomes this year, including 40.8% of those making $150,000 a year or more, up from 20% a year ago. And consumers reported feeling more optimistic than they did a year ago. Perhaps that helps explain why Americans continue to spend aggressively on travel. The Transportation Security Administration screened a record 2.99 million people at airports on Sunday. The agency is bracing for a record-setting summer of air travel, peaking over the Fourth of July holiday. TSA expects to screen more than 32 million people from June 27 through July 8, 5.4% more than last year. Still, to manage financial stress, 43.1% of consumers indicate they are cutting discretionary spending for things like entertainment and dining out. More than a third (37.1%) of those making more than $150,000 a year say they are doing the same. Some consumers are even cutting spending on essentials like food or medical care, with 23.5% of all Americans saying they are doing that, compared with 17.1% of high-earners. Other steps include taking an additional job (15.3% of higher earners), borrowing more (10.2%) and taking money out of retirement savings early (14.3%).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/economy/wealthy-economy-inflation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_business_japan-pufferfish-cup-noodles-release-intl-hnk", "text": "Pufferfish is regarded as a luxury in Japan and a meal featuring the potentially poisonous delicacy can easily cost up to 20,000 yen ($125) at high-end restaurants. But now, adventurous foodies in Japan can get a taste of \u201cfugu\u201d for a fraction of the price, from a cup noodle. Japanese instant noodle giant Nissin Foods released the new pufferfish flavor on Monday, expanding its massive lineup. The noodles sell for a recommended price of 298 yen ($1.90). The \u201cessence\u201d of pufferfish is condensed into a small packet of oil to be added to the soup base, Nissin said in a statement on its website, though it did not divulge how the potentially deadly flavoring is prepared. \u201cIn recent years \u2026 ramen shops specializing in fugu ramen have been popping up, grabbing the hearts of many ramen fans,\u201d it said. A Nissin spokesperson told CNN it has no plans to sell the fugu flavor outside Japan. Each cup comes with dried chicken meatballs, spring onions and Japanese-style shredded egg in a\u00a0soup base enriched by a dash of yuzu, according to the statement. A CNN journalist who tried the instant noodles said it tasted of seafood broth and yuzu, a citrus fruit commonly used in Japanese cooking. Fugu generally has a mild flavor, which wasn\u2019t prominent in the dish. Nissin was founded in 1958 by Momofuku Ando, who saw a need for cheap, accessible food amid shortages following the end of World War II. The company has since expanded into an international household name synonymous with its signature cup noodles. The company posted revenue of more than 732 billion yen ($4.59 billion) in the year to March 2024. While pufferfish, served regularly as sashimi or in hot pot, is a prized item in the Japanese culinary world, almost all of them are poisonous and could, in serious cases, cause death if not properly prepared. The fish\u2019s organs, skin, blood and bones contain high concentrations of tetrodotoxin, a deadly poison.\u00a0Eating it can cause tingling around the mouth and dizziness, which may be followed by convulsions, respiratory paralysis and death, medical experts say. According to Western Australia\u2019s Department of Fisheries, pufferfish, which are found in tropical and subtropical ocean waters,\u00a0are the second most poisonous vertebrate in the world after the golden poison frog, which is native to Colombia. Chefs in Japan must train for at least two years before being allowed to take an examination to qualify to prepare fugu. In 2018, a supermarket in Gamagori city, in Japan\u2019s central Aichi prefecture, issued an alert after two people consumed potentially dangerous fugu products they bought from a supermarket. The pair did not report any health problems, but authorities found that a licensed employee had failed to remove the fish\u2019s poisonous livers. The Japanese delicacy has also been gaining traction overseas in recent years, though it has caused the occasional food scare. In 2020, three people died in the Philippines after they ate pufferfish from a barbecue stand. An elderly couple in Malaysia died last year after eating pufferfish, prompting an appeal from their daughter for stricter regulations. The two, in their early 80s, unknowingly purchased at least two pufferfish from an online vendor and died after consuming them.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/business/japan-pufferfish-cup-noodles-release-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

Filings show that the company took on about $325 million in debt following its purchase of Redbox in 2022 from private equity giant Apollo Global Management. The plan was to make it into an entertainment conglomerate, combining the DVD rental business with its free streaming services, like Crackle, the entertainment platform once owned by Sony.

CoolApp, launched this month to rival WhatsApp and Telegram, will make it \u201cdifficult for foreigners to interfere with our information,\u201d the former prime minister wrote in a post on his official Facebook page this week, adding that he was mindful of \u201cnational security.\u201d \u201cIt is the first-ever Cambodian program and used within the Cambodian security domain,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOther countries have their own social media means of communication like China\u2019s WeChat, Vietnam\u2019s Zalo, South Korea\u2019s Kakao Talk and Russia\u2019s Telegram, so in Cambodia, we have \u2026 our own product,\u201d he added. One of the world\u2019s longest-serving leaders, Hun Sen has ruled Cambodia with an iron fist for more than three decades. Though his eldest son, Hun Manet, succeeded him as prime minister last year, Hun Sen remains the ruling party\u2019s center of power. The country has been at the center of a multi-billion dollar online scam epidemic in Southeast Asia, run predominantly by Chinese gangs, which has raised global security concerns from bodies like the US State Department and the United Nations. CoolApp founder and CEO Lim Cheavutha told CNN the app has been downloaded 150,000 times and does not monitor, collect or store user data. It uses end-to-end encryption to ensure data and calls remain secure, he said. \u201cOnly you and the person you are communicating with can read or listen (to messages and calls) \u2014 nobody in between,\u201d he said. He predicted the app will eventually reach 500,000 or 1 million downloads, though he did not provide a timeframe. Meta\u2019s WhatsApp, the world\u2019s most popular messaging app, is estimated to have millions of users in Cambodia. Greater online surveillance Internet freedom in Cambodia has experienced a drastic regression under Hun Sen\u2019s rule, rights groups say. Censorship, media blackouts and online harassment are rampant. Activists have noted increased state surveillance, which has led to the arrest and persecution of government critics over the years as well as the shutdown of independent media outlets and websites. CNN has reached out to Hun Sen\u2019s office for comment. A prolific social media user who once famously denied buying likes for his Facebook page, Hun Sen has considered banning the site, the most popular social media platform in the country, saying he was fed up about online abuse from political opponents abroad. In 2023, a quasi-independent oversight board for Facebook\u2019s parent company Meta (META) recommended that Hun Sen\u2019s Facebook and Instagram accounts be suspended for six months for using language that could incite violence, according to Reuters. Mu Sochua, an opposition leader living in exile overseas, told CNN that Cambodians \u201cshould not be fooled by the strongman leader\u2019s promotion of CoolApp.\u201d \u201cI see it as nothing but another violent assault on civil liberties in Cambodia,\u201d she said, calling the app a \u201cChinese-style mechanism for the control of public discourse and mass surveillance.\u201d Hun Sen and the Cambodian government have close ties with China\u2019s ruling Communist Party, which oversees a massive surveillance network. \u201cAlready civil servants are ordered to download CoolApp,\u201d Mu Sochua said. \u201cWho dares to oppose the order?\u201d Another exiled Cambodian opposition leader, Sam Rainsy, echoed calls to boycott CoolApp, saying the app would \u201cstrengthen repressive tools at the disposal of the regime.\u201d \u201cThis is ironic coming from a leader who has a long history and track record of secretly listening in to private opposition discussions,\u201d Sam Rainsy said, noting previous instances of Hun Sen controlling social media discourse.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/tech/cambodia-coolapp-messaging-surveillance-fears-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_investing_boeing-spirit-aerosystems", "text": "Boeing has agreed to buy Spirit AeroSystems, one of its major suppliers and manufacturing partners, as part of its plan to overhaul the aircraft maker\u2019s badly damaged safety reputation. The all-stock deal, that values the supplier at $4.7 billion, or $37.25 per share, was announced Monday after months of discussions between Boeing and the company it spun off in 2005. Boeing in March announced its intention to buy Spirit, saying recombining the companies would boost safety. Boeing\u2019s current executives have admitted that the 2005 sale of Spirit to private equity buyers, which fetched only $900 million at that time, had proved to be a mistake for Boeing, hurting the reliability of its supply chain. The total transaction value is approximately\u00a0$8.3 billion, including Spirit\u2019s last reported net debt. \u201cWe believe this deal is in the best interest of the flying public, our airline customers, the employees of Spirit and Boeing, our shareholders and the country more broadly,\u201d said Boeing President and CEO\u00a0Dave Calhoun in a statement. Spirit AeroSystems makes major parts of several Boeing models, including the fuselages for the 737 Max. The parts are then shipped to Boeing\u2019s factories for assembly. The company also makes parts for Boeing\u2019s rival Airbus, although Boeing is Spirit\u2019s largest customer. Spirit split up The Boeing acquisition will mean breaking up Spirit. The supplier\u2019s \u201cmajor activities\u201d related to Airbus will be bought by the European planemaker for a nominal $1, Airbus said in a statement Monday. Those activities include production of A350 fuselage sections in Kinston, North Carolina, and St. Nazaire, France, and A220 wings and mid-fuselage in Belfast, United Kingdom, Airbus said in its statement. It will receive $559 million from Spirit as compensation. Boeing had sought to get more money from rival Airbus for its part of Spirit, said Richard Aboulafia, a managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace industry consultant. Airbus\u2019 business with Spirit accounted for $1.1 billion, 19% of its revenue in 2023, according to company filings, while $3.9 billion, or 64% came from business with Boeing. But Spirit was unwilling to contribute to the deal that Boeing was desperate to complete. Spirit has had its own series of quality control issues in recent years, and Boeing had agreed to pay the company more money to try to improve Spirit\u2019s quality and reliability issues, which had damaged Boeing\u2019s output and reputation. The payments came to an extra $60 million in revenue last year and $395 million in 2024 and 2025. Those payments are an indication of Boeing\u2019s motivation for a deal for Spirit. It can\u2019t return to profitability itself, or fix its own quality issues needed to assure regulators, airlines and the flying public about the safety of its aircraft, unless problems at Spirit are also fixed. And it\u2019s going to cost Boeing money to fix those problems, whether it is the largest customer, or the owner, of those operations. Problems at Spirit Aerosystems Spirit was involved in the January door plug blowout on an Alaska Airways 737 Max shortly after takeoff that left a gaping hole in the side of the aircraft. Boeing said last week two different groups of employees were charged with doing work to the door plug, which is a part that is used in place of an emergency exit door. The first group of employees removed the door plug to address problems with rivets that were made by Spirit AeroSystems. But the Boeing staff didn\u2019t generate the paperwork indicating they had removed the door plug, along with the four bolts necessary to hold it in place, in order to do that work. So the second group of employees replaced it, unaware the bolts were missing. Since the Alaska Air incident, Boeing has placed a number of employees in Spirit\u2019s factories to insure that its products were being made according to specifications. Several whistleblowers have come forward since that incident, including some employees and contractors for Spirit. Last week, for example, a whistleblower from a contractor for Spirit AeroSystems said he notified the company of wide gaps in a key part of 787 Dreamliner planes that posed \u201ccatastrophic\u201d danger to passengers. Spirit has been involved in other safety problems for Boeing. In 2023 it used a \u201cnon-standard manufacturing process\u201d when joining parts of the fuselages of 737 Max jets, leading Boeing to halt deliveries of the planes. Earlier this year, a Spirit employee notified Boeing that two holes may not have been drilled exactly to Boeing\u2019s requirements, which required Boeing to rework about 50 planes that had not yet been delivered. The US Justice Department is nearing an agreement with Boeing that would include a corporate monitor and a fine in exchange for a guilty plea to criminal charges, according to lawyers representing the families of victims of two fatal 737 Max crashes, who harshly rebuked the offer as a \u201csweetheart deal.\u201d Shares of Boeing (BA), which had already fallen 30% so far this year in the wake of the Alaska Air incident, fell another 1% in premarket trading on news of the deal. Shares of Spirit (SPR) rose 5%, but to less than the $37.25 a share stated value of the deal, reflecting doubts about the future value of Boeing shares to be used in the purchase.

{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_business_india-adani-slum-redevelopment-concerns-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "When Masoom Ali Shaikh arrived in Mumbai in 1974 as a young man from northern India, the patch of land where he set up shop was \u201cjust a creek with no proper road and garbage all around,\u201d he said. Fifty years later, that swampy area \u2014 once a fishing village and rubbish dump \u2014 is now Dharavi, one of Asia\u2019s biggest slums and a bustling hub of industry in India\u2019s financial capital. Famously depicted in the 2008 Oscar-winning film \u201cSlumdog Millionaire,\u201d Dharavi is a\u00a0cacophonous maze of small businesses on every corner, from bakeries to butchers to barbers. These shops service roughly one million residents living cheek by jowl in cramped buildings and narrow alleys. Many of them are migrants and artisans who brought the crafts of their home states to establish businesses in the sprawling 500-acre slum. These small-scale enterprises, which generate a collective annual turnover of more than $1 billion by some estimates, are a crucial source of livelihood for many families, some of whom have lived in Dharavi for generations. Shaikh is one of them. After arriving in Dharavi from his home state Uttar Pradesh, he set up a shoe-making business which allowed him to support six family members over the years, even opening a second shoe store for his daughter to operate. However, many residents fear their livelihoods could now be at risk as the slum prepares to undergo a drastic transformation, overseen by one of Asia\u2019s richest men. Over the decades, there have been several failed attempts to redevelop Dharavi, a process which experts say has always been politically fraught for several reasons: the sheer scale and density of the slum and the high value of its land in central Mumbai, for starters. Residents and authorities point to the slum\u2019s myriad problems, including extreme crowdedness and poor sanitation. Many residents have no access to running water or clean toilets and suffer from various health problems. In some poorly ventilated areas, dust perpetually hangs in the air and smoke wafts from nearby workshops. That could change with this newest plan, led by billionaire and infrastructure tycoon Gautam Adani, founder of the Adani Group, who briefly ousted Jeff Bezos as the world\u2019s second-wealthiest person in 2022. \u201cA new chapter of pride and purpose is beginning. It is a historic opportunity for us to create a new Dharavi of dignity, safety and inclusiveness,\u201d Adani wrote in a message on his company\u2019s website after winning the bid to redevelop the area in 2022. He vowed to \u201ccreate a state-of-the-art world-class city, which will reflect a resurgent, self-assured, growing India finding its new place on the global stage as the 21st century belongs to India.\u201d But his vision of a new Dharavi has been met with mixed reactions, from hopeful residents ready for change to skeptics who have heard empty rhetoric for years. Some are vehemently against the proposal, with demonstrators taking to the streets in protest, concerned that Adani\u2019s plan could imperil their homes and businesses. \u201cWhen redevelopment happens, the only thing I want is to be relocated to the same place,\u201d Shaikh told CNN during a visit to his workshop in April, speaking as his employees hammered out soles and manipulated leather onto shoe moulds. \u201cIf I am thrown into some different area, I will lose all my business and my livelihood,\u201d he added. \u201cMy vendors and buyers will not know where I am moved, which would harm my business.\u201d Lofty promises Migrants have been flocking to Dharavi for more than a century, according to Mumbai authorities, many settling there because it was free and unregulated government-owned land. Almost from the start, Dharavi was defined by its industries: from the traditional potters of Gujarat who began arriving in the late 1800s, to leather tanners from Tamil Nadu and embroidery workers from Uttar Pradesh. The slum\u2019s growth reflected that of Mumbai itself, a diverse city famous for attracting Bollywood hopefuls and job-seekers from across India. Throughout the country, migrants and poorer populations often settle on \u201cperipheral lands, unwanted lands, because they\u2019re seen as hazardous in some way or uninhabitable,\u201d said Lalitha Kamath, a professor of urban planning and policy at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai. In Dharavi\u2019s case, \u201cthey built a habitable place \u2026 they reclaimed it from marshy land to something today that\u2019s really valuable,\u201d she added. But because of its informal nature, Dharavi remained undeveloped and haphazard for many years. It wasn\u2019t until the 1970s that the government made basic improvements: building key roads, laying sewers and water lines and providing residents with taps, toilets and electricity. For decades, the government struggled to find developers and builders who could carry out the expensive, logistically complicated task of redeveloping Dharavi from top to bottom. There were also many questions at play: Which residents would be re-located, and to where? How would business owners be compensated? Who would be eligible? \u201cAll slum redevelopment is quite fraught,\u201d Kamath said. But Dharavi had unique challenges due to the size of its population, the importance of its economy, and the value of the land \u2014 surrounded by affluent commercial districts in the heart of the city, close enough to the airport that arriving planes can see the sprawl of the slum from the air. After years of stalled progress and failed tendering processes, Adani\u2019s company won the right to redevelop Dharavi with a 50 billion rupee ($612 million) bid, Reuters reported at the time. It\u2019s expected to take seven years to complete, and is the latest mega-project taken on by Adani Enterprises, which already supplies electricity in Mumbai. His promises are lofty. About a million people will be \u201crehabilitated and resettled,\u201d with both residential homes and businesses up for redevelopment, he said in the message on his website. And, he vowed, residents will have better healthcare and recreational facilities, open spaces, a hospital and school, and more, he said. Ineligible residents who can\u2019t be rehoused within Dharavi will be given relocation options instead. But some residents aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cFor the last 30 years, we are dreaming and hearing about redevelopment, but nothing has taken place,\u201d said Dilip Gabekar, 60, who was born in Dharavi and works for a non-profit aiding women and children in the slum. \u201cOnly during elections, there is noise about redeveloping\u00a0Dharavi,\u201d he added, speaking to CNN weeks before Mumbai went to the polls in May in a nationwide election that ultimately saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his far-right Bharatiya Janata Party win another five-year term. \u201cBut once elections are over, the talks about redevelopment also die down,\u201d he added, despite Adani having won the bid long before the most recent general election. In response to CNN\u2019s request for comment, a spokesperson from the Dharavi Redevelopment Project Private Ltd (DRPPL) said the project was \u201ccommitted to fulfilling Dharavi\u2019s needs and providing residents with new homes with better amenities, accessibility, and resources.\u201d They added that they are exploring \u201call possible options\u201d to protect livelihoods and businesses, and to help raise people\u2019s incomes \u2014 for instance, by consolidating supply chains, giving all businesses tax refunds for five years and launching job initiatives for youth and women. Who gets a free house? Chief among residents\u2019 worries is their eligibility under Adani\u2019s plan, which could determine who gets a free new apartment in the redeveloped space and who may have to move elsewhere on their own dime. According to the DRPPL spokesperson, ground-floor residents who lived in Dharavi before the year 2000 will be granted a free unit within the area that is at least 350 square feet. Higher-floor residents, or those who lived there between 2000 and 2011, will receive a 300-square-foot home following a one-time payment of 250,000 rupees (about $3,000), located within 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) of Dharavi. Those who moved to Dharavi after 2011 will also receive a 300-square-foot home within the same radius, but will have to pay rent to the government. All apartments, either in or near Dharavi, will have separate bedrooms, toilets and kitchens, the spokesperson said. The plan is a collaboration between Adani and Maharashtra state authorities. The land itself will remain government-owned. With the last survey conducted in Dharavi 15 years ago, a firm hired by Adani is now going door to door to collect residents\u2019 information. That could spell trouble for many residents who never got the proper documents to prove their long-term tenancy. \u201cThere is no alternative for someone who has no proper paperwork,\u201d said Gabekar, the NGO worker.\u00a0Many of those deemed ineligible can\u2019t afford to relocate to the housing options provided by Adani, he added. Even those with the right papers are worried. Shaikh, the shoemaker, showed CNN his tenancy and business documents. They\u2019re written in smeared blue ink, laminated and kept carefully tucked away in a drawer. \u201cI have enough papers to prove that I have been in this place for a long time,\u201d he said. But, he added, many businesses have changed hands over the years, leaving new owners without the proper documents. Baburao Mane, a former elected state assembly member affiliated with the opposition party, and a Dharavi native himself, has led some of the most vocal protests against the Adani plan, including a rally in December that saw thousands of people march to Adani\u2019s offices in Mumbai. Only about 50,000 residents, about 5% of the population, have valid papers, Mane estimated. He claimed that the ongoing survey would bring that number down further. \u201cThey should make no difference between valid and non-valid papers to allot places. Anyone who has land in\u00a0Dharavi\u00a0should be given land during the redevelopment,\u201d he said. When asked about concerns over proving eligibility, the DRPPL spokesperson said its plan had \u201csuitable redressal mechanisms to address such eventualities.\u201d Even if eligible residents get re-housed within Dharavi, there are concerns over space. Often, several generations of a family live within cramped multi-story buildings. But only the ground-floor residents will receive the free housing, leaving about 700,000 upper-floor residents ineligible, NDTV reported. \u201cAll the houses in Dharavi have two or three floors \u2026 I have 15 family members who stay above each other (in the same building),\u201d said Neeta Jadhav, a 46-year-old resident who has lived in Dharavi for 26 years, and who has the documents to prove eligibility. \u201cIf we are all put in one small apartment there will be a lot of conflict, so the developer should consider giving us a bigger space,\u201d she said. Mane, the former politician and protest leader, said the group was demanding 500 square feet for each Dharavi household, vowing to \u201cnot let even one house be demolished\u201d until the government agrees to their conditions. Hope and mistrust Despite the pushback from some, there is uniform agreement among residents that Dharavi does need redevelopment. It\u2019s just a question of how, and who can be trusted with such a mammoth project. \u201cI will be happy if development takes place,\u201d said resident Jadhav. \u201cI want my children to have a better life, and move from here to a place that has proper amenities like a good school and a park for them to play.\u201d \u201cIf Adani gives what he has promised, then our life will improve for sure,\u201d she added. And there are some who are enthusiastically in favor of Adani\u2019s plan. \u201cIf Adani redevelops\u00a0Dharavi, it will be good for us as we don\u2019t want to stay\u00a0in Dharavi\u00a0any longer,\u201d said 42-year-old potter Dhanshuk Purshottamwala, whose family has lived in the area and run the pottery business for generations. He hopes Adani\u2019s plan will end that family tradition, with all their necessary papers in order. \u201cI don\u2019t want my children to be living the way I am,\u201d he said, speaking to CNN from his workshop where wet and drying pots line the walls and floors. \u201cI don\u2019t teach my children this skill, I want them to study and have a better life.\u201d While the redevelopment is a massive challenge, Adani is behind some of India\u2019s most ambitious infrastructure projects. He is India\u2019s largest airport operator and\u00a0owns India\u2019s biggest private port operator and private thermal power operator. He\u2019s also one of the country\u2019s largest developers and operators of coal mines, and is simultaneously building the world\u2019s biggest clean energy plant. However, he\u2019s a relative newcomer in the field of slum redevelopment and affordable housing, said Kamath, adding that the lack of affordable housing is what prompted people to set up informal settlements in the first place. And for most residents that CNN spoke to, their hopes for change are dimmed by deep distrust of Adani\u2019s conglomerate and the city government. Several pointed to the 2023 fraud allegations against the Adani Group, which sparked an ongoing investigation by India\u2019s regulators and lost the company over $100 billion in value in a stock market meltdown.\u00a0In January, the country\u2019s top court ordered the regulators to quickly finish their investigation\u00a0and said no further probes were needed, a decision Adani celebrated at the time. His representatives have called the allegations baseless and malicious. Others residents complained about a lack of transparency, saying they had received little official communication and were not included in meetings about the redevelopment, leaving them in the dark about the details or timing of the plan. This is common across many slum redevelopments in India, said Kamath, describing these projects as top-down, with power held by a small group of private developers and state officials. \u201cFolks from the community will very rarely get much space at the table,\u201d she said. It\u2019s one reason why \u201cthere are concerns with all kinds of redevelopment projects that have been proposed, not just this one, because they usually don\u2019t do justice to every group that lives there or has claim to that space, who has made it what it is today,\u201d she said. Then, there\u2019s an ongoing lawsuit by a rival company that alleged the Maharashtra state government had improperly canceled an original 2018 bidding process\u00a0and restarted it so Adani could win, according to Reuters. The state and Adani deny any wrongdoing, but that hasn\u2019t stopped many residents from viewing Adani and his government ties with suspicion. Adani is a vocal champion of Prime Minister Modi, and opposition leaders have ferociously questioned their relationship \u2014 with some even claiming that they were punished for pursuing the issue. The DRPPL spokesperson said Adani had won the project \u201cthrough an open, transparent, fair, and competitive bidding process,\u201d and said claims of any political relationships were \u201cbaseless and aimed at spreading misinformation.\u201d Meanwhile, some are simply tired of listening to the same old promises. \u201cI have grown\u00a0from a child to a woman (in Dharavi) and the development saga just keeps going on,\u201d said Reshma Prasant Bobde, a 42-year-old housewife whose family has lived there for generations. She described seeing the same cycle of politicians pushing redevelopment for \u201ctheir own agenda,\u201d followed by residents protesting and, ultimately, stagnation. \u201cThis talk of development\u00a0has been going on since my grandmother\u2019s time, but it hasn\u2019t moved an inch,\u201d she said. \u201cMy children, who are 11 and seven years old, will grow old and nothing will change in\u00a0Dharavi.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/business/india-adani-slum-redevelopment-concerns-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

This contrasts with the results of an official government survey Sunday that showed a contraction among larger, state-owned manufacturers, underscoring that the recovery in the world\u2019s second largest economy remains uneven. The Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI)\u00a0rose to 51.8 in June, up from 51.7 in May, according to a statement from S&P Global, which compiled the survey. The numbers not only beat market expectations but also marked the sixth straight month of improvement in the index. But the gauge conflicted with the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)\u2019s PMI, which was unchanged from May at 49.5, marking a second consecutive month of contraction. The PMI\u00a0is a monthly indicator of economic activity. A reading above\u00a050\u00a0indicates expansion, while anything below that level shows\u00a0contraction. \u201cThe divergence\u201d between the Caixin and the official PMIs has widened further from May and is likely because of differences in the sectors covered, said analysts from Goldman Sachs on Monday. The Caixin survey covers more export-oriented and consumer-related companies. The official PMI, however, is tilted more towards manufacturers that produce industrial materials \u2014 including steel, cement, and chemical \u2014 making them more vulnerable to a slowdown in fixed-asset investments. Analysts believe that the current data reflects an economic reality characterised by strong exports and consumption, but softer investment. \u201cDemand for consumer and intermediate goods was stronger than that for investment goods,\u201d said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group. \u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector kept improving in June, with supply, domestic demand, and exports continuing to grow,\u201d he added. Customs data for June are not available yet, but statistics for May showed that the country\u2019s exports jumped 7.6% from a year earlier, beating analysts\u2019 forecasts. Still, manufacturers are less optimistic about the outlook, as recent tariff announcements from the US and European Union have damped their sentiment. \u201cThe gauge for future output expectations \u2026 fell by more than three points from the previous month, marking the lowest since November 2019,\u201d Wang said. \u201cConcerns expressed by surveyed companies [in the Caixin index] were focused on prominent downward pressure on the economy and intense market competition,\u201d he added. Last month, the EU announced additional tariffs of up to 38.1% on electric vehicles imported from China,because of what it sees as Beijing\u2019s unfair support for companies that undercut European carmakers. The provisional tariffs are set to apply by July 4, while the investigation will continue. The duties will then be finalized on November 2 at the end of the probe. The EU\u2019s decision came a month after the United States quadrupled tariffs on EVs from China, from 25% to 100%, a move aimed at boosting American jobs and manufacturing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/business/china-economy-uneven-recovery-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

Workers across the US automotive industry told CNN that the software blackout, which the company said was caused by a cyberattack, has made it difficult for dealers to track customer interactions, orders and sales, hurting their ability to earn a living. \u201cIt\u2019s going to affect payroll here,\u201d said Bernard Irvin, a salesperson at a Ford dealership in Greenville, South Carolina. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I receive my normal pay? I don\u2019t really understand what this is all about.\u201d The workers\u2019 concerns illustrate how a cyberattack,\u00a0even one on something as overlooked as record-keeping and scheduling software, can cripple an entire industry. According to an estimate by Anderson Economic Group, CDK\u2019s system collapse could result in approximately $944 million in direct losses due to business interruptions for affected car dealers if the outage lasts a full three weeks. Piecemeal progress The outage began last Wednesday after two cyber incidents halted the company\u2019s systems, which provide software to nearly 15,000 car dealerships across North America, according to CDK. In a statement on Friday, the company said it was making progress in bringing some dealerships back online. Previously, the company said it did not expect the issue to be entirely resolved until July. \u201cWe have successfully brought two small groups of dealers and one large publicly traded dealer group live on the Dealer Management System (DMS). We are also actively working to bring live additional applications \u2014 including our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Service solutions \u2014 and our Customer Care channels,\u201d according to a CDK spokesperson. \u201cWe understand and share the urgency for our customers to get back to business as usual, and we will continue providing updates as more information is available.\u201d Dozens of automotive retail workers expressed concern about how the outage affected their livelihoods. \u201cI work at a major body shop, and it has really hurt us,\u201d one worker wrote to CNN about the outage. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to get paid.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s going to affect payroll\u2019 At 71, Norm Phillips has worked as a car parts delivery driver at both a Mercedes-Benz dealership and a Honda dealership in New Jersey for more than 21 years. Since CDK\u2019s malfunction, he hadn\u2019t been able to work at all. The dealerships had not been able to see which parts needed to be delivered. \u201cWhen I asked my boss if we were still going to be paid, he didn\u2019t answer the question,\u201d Phillips told CNN on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019ve been home for a week looking for another job.\u201d Even if CDK resolves the issue, Phillips said he feared the possibility of another cyberattack. \u201cI feel like the writing is on the wall. If hackers can get into a system and take my job away, I feel like it\u2019s probably not the right job to do right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no security.\u201d Phillips wasn\u2019t alone in expressing his frustration. \u201c15,000 dealerships is an awful lot to have control over when you do the math,\u201d Irvin said of CDK. \u201cIt is ridiculous.\u201d Irvin said he realized something was amiss with the CDK software he relied on to help prospective clients when a couple interested in purchasing a new Ford Bronco Sport came in to his dealership early last week. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything I normally can do,\u201d Irvin said. \u201cI was at a complete standstill and was only able to do really basic things.\u201d Without CDK\u2019s recordkeeping system, Irvin also said he believed his dealership cannot keep track of accurate commission payments. \u201cYou have to make sales,\u201d said Irvin. \u201cOtherwise, you go home and you don\u2019t eat.\u201d Even without access to the software, business has carried on, albeit slowly. In the end, Irvin said it took a week to get the couple who bought their Ford Bronco Sport the bill of sale, which proves ownership of their new car. All of the documents had to be written out by hand. And after more than a week at home, Phillips\u2019 boss texted him to return to work on Friday. They planned to track some parts deliveries and check collections manually. \u201cI\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t come up with the method sooner!\u201d Phillips wrote in an email. \u201cIt will be a new adventure.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/cars/cdk-outage-car-dealers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_business_levis-mass-layoffs-turkey-strike", "text": "Levi\u2019s is a global brand that says it has always stood up for \u201cwhat\u2019s right.\u201d But its claim to be an ethical company is now in question following the release of a report from an independent labor monitoring group. Critics accuse Levi\u2019s (LEVI) of ignoring its own labor standards after it continued working with a factory in Turkey that fired around 400 people last year after they joined a union and went on strike over pay and working conditions. Turkey is a critical link in the global supply chain for apparel. The country exported around $30 billion worth of apparel and textiles last year, according to the Istanbul Exporters\u2019 Association, a clothing industry group. One player in the industry is Ozak Tekstil\u2019s factory in Turkey\u2019s Sanliurfa region, which exclusively makes jeans for Levi\u2019s. Ozak Tekstil also produces clothing in its other factories in Turkey for brands such as Zara, Hugo Boss, Guess, Mango and Ralph Lauren, according to the report by the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC), published Friday. Seher Gulel worked in quality control at the factory before she was fired in late November. She was paid Turkey\u2019s minimum wage, she told CNN, which at the time was about $15 a day. Pressure, bullying and insults by managers were frequent, she says, and excessively long days were common. She would often work from 8 a.m. until midnight or even into the early morning hours \u2014 even though, under Turkish law, workers should not work more than 11 hours in a day. \u201cThe (illegal) overtime problem was constant,\u201d she said. Ozak Tekstil said its overtime hours and payments were within the law. Months into the job Gulel had had enough. She joined a new union, Birtek-Sen, switching from another one, which she says was ineffective and \u201calways pro-boss.\u201d (The union denies this). Within 10 days of joining Birtek-Sen, she was fired for what Ozak Tekstil called \u201cquality control errors.\u201d Her dismissal provided the spark for hundreds of workers at the factory to walk off the job, according to the WRC report and Gulel. The workers had been on strike for a little over two weeks when Ozak Tekstil made good its threat to fire those who refused to return to work. Roughly 400 were dismissed in mid-December \u2014 almost half the factory\u2019s staff. \u201cWe were looking for justice,\u201d Gulel told CNN. \u201cBut we got injustice. Ozak Tekstil told CNN it had terminated the workers \u201cas a last resort\u201d when they declined an invitation to return to work.\u00a0It also said that, while a Turkish law enshrines the right to strike, under the same law, Birtek-Sen didn\u2019t have enough members to collectively bargain and organize a strike. \u201cSince the day the factory was founded, workers\u2019 right to unionize has always been respected,\u201d Ozak Tekstil said. However, the WRC report says: \u201cThe labor law also flatly prohibits employers from firing workers for striking, even in the case of an illegal strike, unless the country\u2019s labor courts have first ruled that the strike in question is unlawful.\u201d A court did rule that the strike had been illegal but the ruling didn\u2019t come until five months after the firings. In an email between Levi\u2019s and the Birtek-Sen union, shared with CNN by the WRC, Levi\u2019s acknowledged that the mass firings violated its own supplier code of conduct, which states that its factories \u201cshall respect the right to free association and the right to organize and bargain collectively without unlawful interference.\u201d Importantly for Gulel\u2019s case, the code also dictates that suppliers must ensure workers who join the union \u201care not the object of discrimination, harassment, or punitive disciplinary actions.\u201d In that email, dated December 22, 2023, the company also said it had instructed Ozak Tekstil to reinstate the workers. If it refused, \u201cwe will be forced to take the appropriate next steps to uphold workers\u2019 rights,\u201d Levi\u2019s wrote. \u2018Meaningless\u2019 standards But Ozak Tekstil didn\u2019t do what Levi\u2019s was asking. It did not reinstate all of the fired workers. The company told CNN it had offered most of the workers their jobs back (but without the right to continue with the strike), but only a handful had accepted the offer. On April 1, months after the mass dismissals, Levi\u2019s wrote to the WRC reconfirming that its code of conduct had been violated but adding that it was \u201cless clear that exiting Ozak and potentially putting an additional 400 people out of work in the process is how we should proceed.\u201d This is how WRC executive director Scott Nova summarized the situation: \u201cThe factory said no, and Levi\u2019s in the end said, \u2018well, okay, we\u2019ll give you business anyway.\u2019\u201d He called the firings \u201cone of the most brazen, outrageous violations\u201d of workers\u2019 right to strike that he\u2019d seen anywhere in years. \u201cThe message Levi\u2019s is sending to all of its suppliers globally \u2014 of which there are many hundreds \u2014 is that Levi\u2019s labor standards are meaningless. But even though Levi\u2019s says factories have to respect the rights of workers, what Levi\u2019s really wants is cheap blue jeans produced quickly regardless of the consequences for the workers who make them,\u201d Nova said. In a statement to CNN, Levi\u2019s said it had \u201ca\u00a0longstanding commitment to supporting safe, productive workplaces for workers, and we take any allegations of efforts to curtail freedom of association extremely seriously.\u201d It said it continued sourcing jeans from the factory despite the mass firings, to avoid further job losses, but the continuation of its relationship with the supplier depends \u201con management\u2019s fulfillment of a detailed remediation plan that addresses freedom of association, working hours, and health and safety.\u201d As for Gulel\u2019s allegations of excessive overtime and abusive managers at the factory, Levi\u2019s did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Hugo Boss told CNN that, although its products are manufactured at other Ozak Tekstil plants, it was \u201cmonitoring the accusations\u201d at the Sanliurfa factory. \u201cOzak has confirmed that it complies with our social standards, which are mandatory for a business relationship with\u00a0Hugo Boss, and that a trade union has been active in the company for over 10 years,\u201d said Carolin Westermann, a spokesperson for the German brand. \u2018Blacklisted\u2019 While most fired workers received a severance payment, many are now struggling to find a job \u2014 and that may be due to something else they received from Ozak Tekstil: an effective black mark in a publicly accessible government database. Gulel has been out of work for seven months and former union rep Funda Bakis, who was fired in mid-December, for more than six. They both say they\u2019re now \u201cblacklisted.\u201d According to Gulel\u2019s dismissal notice seen by CNN, the official reason for her firing stated in the database is \u201ccode 50,\u201d which means the employee \u201cendangers the safety of the job due to (their) own will or negligence, causes damage and loss to the machines \u2026 to the extent that (they) cannot repay with the amount of (their) 30-day wage.\u201d As for Bakis, she was given \u201ccode 46,\u201d which indicates behavior \u201csuch as abusing the employer\u2019s trust, stealing, revealing the employer\u2019s professional secrets.\u201d Ozak Tekstil didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s question on why it had chosen those codes, beyond insisting the firings had been justified.

Bakis has moved in with her parents and lives alongside more than 10 other people in a three-bedroom apartment, amounting to about 100 square meters (1,076 square feet) of space. Seasonal farm work may now be her only employment option. \u201cWe expected more from Levi\u2019s than from Ozak, because it\u2019s an international company and a brand that talks a lot about humane working conditions,\u201d she said, noting that some of her friends who had also been fired by the factory in December had \u201cchildren at home who were hungry.\u201d According to WRC researchers, who have been in touch with Levi\u2019s for months, the company has no plans to provide monetary assistance or compensation to any of the fired workers.

{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

Cup Noodles is trying to change that \u2014 with a new s\u2019mores-flavored instant ramen. The limited-edition offering combines microwavable noodles with a sauce-based flavor blend of chocolate, marshmallow and graham crackers, plus additional mini marshmallows to sprinkle on top. The result: a sweet and gooey dessert you can prepare in just five minutes. While this marks Cup Noodles\u2019 first foray into dessert territory, the noodle maker is no stranger to non-traditional ramen pairings. \u201cCup Noodles Campfire S\u2019mores\u201d is the latest in a series of seasonal flavors aimed at shaking up how consumers perceive the brand. Parent company Nissin will sell the $1.18 soup online and at Walmart stores nationally while supplies last. But a cheap image is one of the challenges facing Cup Noodles, said GlobalData retail analyst Neil Saunders, He sees the brand\u2019s experiments with unconventional combinations as an attempt to elevate its products and expand the occasions when a consumer might choose to eat ramen. \u201cIt\u2019s positioned as being something that\u2019s quite interesting and novel, not just a boring thing you\u2019d buy because you\u2019re on a budget,\u201d Saunders said. Nissin Foods USA Senior VP of Marketing Priscila Stanton pointed to previous limited offerings as Cup Noodles\u2019 efforts to expand beyond a \u201cpantry staple.\u201d That lineup of flavors includes Pumpkin Spice, Everything Bagel and Breakfast (a mixture of the classic breakfast combination of maple syrup pancakes, sausage and eggs). \u201cRamen is eaten at all parts of the day during all times,\u201d she said. \u201cWe believe that ramen can play in all of these different areas, and sweet is definitely one of those areas that we\u2019ve had some success in.\u201d S\u2019mores season With summer season in full swing, there\u2019s been no shortage of s\u2019mores flavored snacks. Brands like Oreo, Pop Tarts and Goldfish have debuted their own renditions of the beloved campfire treat. Despite the saturated s\u2019mores market, Saunders sees Cup Noodles as occupying a unique position that could get people talking because of ramen\u2019s association with traditionally savory flavors. \u201cIt shakes things up in the consumer\u2019s mind,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s sweet, it\u2019s odd, but that actually adds to the \u2018let\u2019s taste this and see what it\u2019s like\u2019 factor.\u201d Nissin sees the main opportunity among Gen Z and millennials. Stanton says younger buyers tend to be more playful with their tastes, adding that the s\u2019mores flavor appeals to the connection between food and childhood memories. \u201cWe believe this nostalgic flavor is going to start a lot of conversations and get people to remember those campfire moments that they had growing up or are still having,\u201d she said. Saunders doesn\u2019t see the s\u2019mores trend ending anytime soon. The snack\u2019s seasonality gives it staying power, he said, comparing it to the recurring pumpkin spice craze in the fall. \u201cI think the s\u2019mores thing is here to stay because it is a very embedded part of consumer culture,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is one of those things that\u2019s a very well-established part of the consumption calendar.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/business/cup-noodles-smores-nissin-ramen/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_07_01_business_adjustable-rate-mortgages-higher-payments", "text": "Last year, when Jennifer Hernandez received notice that the mortgage payments on her Houston home would jump about $2,000 per month, she was stunned. Hernandez refinanced her home loan in 2016 using an adjustable-rate mortgage loan, which has a low introductory rate for a fixed initial period. Unlike the more popular fixed-rate mortgage loans, ARMs can offer temporary relief for homebuyers who want to avoid paying higher mortgage rates \u2014 however, they also come with risk. After the fixed introductory period \u00ad\u2014 usually five, seven or ten years \u00ad\u2014 the rate on an ARM loan adjusts periodically based on current market conditions. That means when mortgage rates increase, many ARM loan holders, like Hernandez, experience the unpleasant shock of significantly higher monthly home payments. For thousands of Americans like Hernandez who took out ARM loans five years ago, before interest rates shot up to a four-decade high, that shock is coming this year. Mortgage rates have remained elevated, adding fuel to one of the most unaffordable housing markets in decades. That led ARMs to gain traction despite their drawbacks. According to data from Intercontinental Exchange, a global provider of technology and data, 1.7 million homeowners have bought homes with adjustable-rate mortgages since 2019. Many buyers who bought 5-year ARMs \u2013 one of the more popular offerings \u2013 will graduate into significantly higher monthly payments this year. The fixed period for these ARMs has already reset for 328,000 homeowners \u2013 and 102,000 more loans will reset over the next 12 months, according to ICE. ARM loans gained a bad reputation after the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007 and 2008, after many homebuyers could no longer afford to make their monthly home payments when their rates reset. While the rate of homebuyers choosing ARMs never rebounded to pre-2008 levels, the share of homebuyers using ARM loans has doubled over the past four years, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Is an adjustable rate a good idea? An ARM may make sense for homebuyers comfortable with the risk of interest rate increases or those who plan to move or refinance before the fixed rate expires, Lorriane Jones, a loan consultant in Southern California, told CNN. But when opting for an ARM, it\u2019s key to keep a close eye on the details, otherwise things can turn difficult, fast. Hernandez, who is herself a loan officer, had misremembered the terms of her $1.1 million loan: rather than a 10/1 ARM, which has a fixed rate for the first ten years and resets every year after that, Hernandez had taken out a 7/1 loan. \u201cI just got caught blindsided,\u201d she said. \u201cLife gets in the way, and you get busy. I\u2019ve been slammed with kids and work for the last seven years.\u201d Last October, Hernandez\u2019s mortgage rate jumped by 2% to 5.125%, the maximum allowed in the first adjustment year, according to her loan terms. Most ARM loans come with an interest rate cap to prevent costs from spiraling out of control. Hernandez said her ARM is capped at 8.125%, five percentage points above her initial fixed rate. To Hernandez, it made little sense to refinance the loan while the 30-year fixed mortgage rate remains higher than her new adjusted rate. But this coming October, she suspects her monthly payments will adjust higher. \u201cI\u2019ve made it work, but now I\u2019m going to have to figure out how to make it work again this October,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful having to worry about it.\u201d Andrew Marquis, a loan officer in Lexington, Massachusetts, said he has recently seen a dramatic increase in ARM loan applications. Homebuyers increasingly believe that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the next few years, giving these buyers time to refinance their loans before the clock on the fixed period of their ARM runs out, he said. The Fed doesn\u2019t directly set mortgage rates, but its actions influence them. This year, the Federal Reserve has signaled that it may possibly cut its benchmark interest rate one time. \u201cI would say on the jumbo loans we\u2019re doing, probably 40% of the loans are doing ARMs,\u201d Marquis said, referring to loan amounts above $766,000. Marquis said that taking out an ARM loan might be worthwhile for those with a higher risk appetite. \u201cIf people can save a half a percent on a seven-year ARM versus a 30-year fixed, they\u2019re saving hundreds of dollars a month,\u201d he said. Interest rates can be unpredictable. Hernandez said she saved money in the initial seven years of her loan, but if she could have a do-over, she likely would not have chosen an adjustable-rate mortgage in 2016. \u201cThis increase in payments hasn\u2019t felt good,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just praying that when my October adjustment comes around, rates have come down a little bit.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/business/adjustable-rate-mortgages-higher-payments/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

The new tower will be built in Jeddah and developed in tandem with Dar Global, the international arm of Saudi mega-developer Dar Al Arkan. If completed, it appears the Jeddah tower would be the Trump Organization\u2019s first major project in Saudi Arabia. \u201cWe are thrilled to expand our footprint in the Middle East and bring the Trump standard of luxury to the region through our long-standing relationship with Dar Global,\u201d Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of former president Donald Trump, said in the announcement. Dar Global said the project will target the \u201cluxury Saudi Arabian market and international investors.\u201d The new project in Saudi Arabia comes just days after the Trump Organization and Dar Global unveiled a $500 million Trump International hotel complex in Oman. That five-star hotel complex, set to open in December 2028, would include a nightclub, golf course and members-only club. Dar Al Arkan has agreed to use the Trump name and logo under license for that hotel, which is not owned by the Trump Organization. The Trump Organization\u2019s new projects in the Middle East could raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest should former President Donald Trump return to the White House. \u201cThe Trump Organization\u2019s continued pursuit of foreign business projects raises perilous national security, corruption and constitutional concerns,\u201d Donald K. Sherman, senior vice president and chief counsel at the Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in Washington (CREW), told CNN in a statement. \u201cThis is particularly true of their development in Saudi Arabia, whose government has a long history of apparently seeking to influence Donald Trump,\u201d Sherman added. \u201cIf Trump were to return to the presidency, he would likely violate the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, as he did repeatedly in his first term in office.\u201d A 2023 analysis by CREW found that Trump made at least $9.6 million from countries in the Middle East during his presidency. The Trump Organization is owned by a private trust that lists the former president as the sole beneficiary. The family business is run by his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. Last year, the Trump Organization was fined $1.6 million by a New York judge for running a decade-long tax fraud scheme. Two Trump entities were convicted of 17 felonies, including tax fraud and falsifying business records. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Last month, Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, launched an investigation into Kushner\u2019s firm and its ties to Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern governments. Wyden expressed concern that the investments in Kushner\u2019s firm could create \u201csignificant conflicts of interest and potential counterintelligence risks.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/business/trump-tower-saudi-arabia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_business_france-election-markets-euro", "text": "French stocks and the euro rallied Monday after results from the first round of elections suggested the far right will inflict a heavy defeat on President Emmanuel Macron but fall short of winning an outright majority in parliament. France\u2019s CAC 40 index, which represents 40 of the biggest companies listed in Paris, rose 2.7% at the open. The index closed 1% higher on the day but is still almost 6% below its level before Macron called the snap election on June 9. Bank stocks, a bellwether for the economy, reversed some of the heavy losses they have suffered in recent weeks. Shares in BNP Paribas closed 3.6% higher, while Societe Generale and Credit Agricole climbed 3.1% and 2.8% respectively. The euro, which tumbled after Macron\u2019s surprise election announcement, briefly touched the strongest level against the dollar in more than two weeks Monday. Yields on French government bonds, or returns demanded by investors for the risk of holding them, were broadly unchanged after widening significantly compared with their ultra-safe German equivalents in recent days. On Friday, the risk premium over German government debt hit its highest level since the eurozone crisis\u00a0more than a decade ago. While the defeat for Macron is likely bad news for France\u2019s precarious finances \u2014 a hung parliament could mean gridlock \u2014 the worst-case scenarios for investors appear to have receded. Just two weeks ago, they were fretting about the possibility that France could be heading for a financial crisis similar to the 2022 UK market crash triggered by unfunded tax cuts pushed by former Prime Minister Liz Truss. After unusually high voter turnout Sunday, Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally party led the first round, clinching 33.15% of the vote, while the left-wing New Popular Front coalition came second with 27.99%. Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance slumped to a dismal third with 20.76%, according to final results published Monday by France\u2019s Interior Ministry. \u201cThe result is probably better than feared (for markets) but not as good as the status three weeks ago pre-elections,\u201d Mohit Kumar, Jefferies chief economist for Europe, wrote in a note Monday. \u201cThe immediate reaction is one of a relief rally.\u201d Going into the first round, investors feared that voters would elect a far-right or far-left parliament committed to spending more, further swelling the country\u2019s already-high debt and budget deficit \u2014 the difference between what the government spends and what it receives in taxes. At the end of last year, France\u2019s government debt amounted to 110.6% of gross domestic product. The budget deficit reached 5.5%\u00a0of GDP, one of the highest among the 27 countries in the European Union. Sunday\u2019s vote may have tempered the risk of extreme fiscal policies in Europe\u2019s second-largest economy, but investors are still concerned that a new, divided parliament won\u2019t be able to tackle the country\u2019s debt problem. \u201cWe could still be looking at the next few years of political paralysis in France with a stalling of the reform process,\u201d said Kumar, referring to Macron\u2019s policies aimed at boosting economic growth. \u2018Gridlock\u2019 ahead? Several other analysts also view a hung parliament as the most likely outcome, which would mean no single party holds a majority of seats. That could result in \u201cgridlock,\u201d according to Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmieding. \u201cIn this case, any new government would not get much done,\u201d he wrote in a note Monday. Worse than gridlock would be if Le Pen\u2019s National Rally joined forces with parts of the left to cut taxes and reverse some of Macron\u2019s reforms, such as raising the retirement age to 64 years for most workers. The National Rally has pledged to slash value-added tax on electricity, fuel and other energy products from 20% to 5.5% and suspend it entirely for scores of basic necessities. Meanwhile, the left-wing New Popular Front has pledged to increase the minimum wage and freeze prices for many essential goods. A third scenario \u2014 dubbed \u201cMarine Meloni\u201d \u2014 could see Le Pen follow the example of Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and concentrate on signature policies such as a tough stance on immigration while watering down \u201cmore expensive or disruptive fiscal promises,\u201d with a view to winning the 2027 presidential election, according to Schmieding. \u201cThe three main scenarios above entail a gradual worsening of the outlook for France\u2026 But they do not point to an immediate Liz-Truss style crisis,\u201d he said. In the long term, there could be a partial reversal of some of Macron\u2019s reforms, reducing economic growth and raising inflation. \u201cCoupled with the prospect of (credit) ratings downgrades, this would add to financing cost and exacerbate France\u2019s fiscal woes over time,\u201d he added. Ratings agency S&P\u00a0downgraded\u00a0the French government\u2019s credit rating in May, citing the \u201cdeterioration of (its) budgetary position,\u201d though it still thinks the country has ample capacity to repay its debts. With the final round of voting set for July 7, the outcome of the French election is still uncertain, with the door still open for Le Pen\u2019s National Rally to win a majority. \u201cWe are doubtful this morning\u2019s improvement in sentiment will be maintained as we head into the next round of voting,\u201d Rabobank analysts wrote in a note.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

On Monday, Gill said in a Securities and Exchange filing that he purchased about 9 million Chewy shares (CHWY), amounting to a 6.6% stake in the company. Chewy shares closed 6.6% lower on Monday after jumping as much as 10% earlier in the session. Chewy shares began gaining last Thursday after Gill, the individual investor who helped spark the frenzied trading around GameStop shares three years ago, posted a photo of a cartoon dog on his X account. The cartoon\u2019s blue background appeared to be the same blue as Chewy\u2019s logo. Shares of the company surged more than 34% that day at its highs before closing 0.3% lower. Meme stocks more typically move on social media sentiment than fundamentals, often posting huge swings based on the buying and selling of influential traders like Gill. Ryan Cohen, the founder of Chewy, is the chief executive of GameStop, the embattled video game retailer Gill is known for championing. Gill revived the meme stock frenzy in May after breaking a three-year social media hiatus to post a cartoon on X. He then posted periodic screenshots of what appeared to be his E*Trade account showing a mammoth position in GameStop shares and options, sending shares of the video game retailer on a wild ride. CNN has not independently verified the screenshots. Last month, Gill revealed that he owns about 9 million shares of GameStop and has exited his huge options position. On Monday\u2019s filing, a question stated: \u201cCheck the appropriate box to designate whether you are a cat.\u201d Gill checked the box stating \u201cI am not a cat,\u201d a possible reference to his Congressional testimony about the meme stock frenzy in 2021 when he told the House Financial Services Committee the same statement.

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Companies have become fonder of part-timers these days. Demand for full-time workers on jobs site Indeed has been flat from January 2022 to May of this year, according to a recent analysis of millions of job postings, but advertisements for part-time gigs were up about 10% over the same period. Postings for those kinds of jobs took off in 2022 and have remained near those elevated levels ever since. (Full-time is still the most common type of work on Indeed by far, according to the report.) Hiring activity has shown a similar trend: The level of part-time employment was\u00a0up 8.9% in May from January 2022, compared to the 1.5% increase of full-time employment during the same period, according to Labor Department data. The could signal a turning point in the labor market, a key aspect of the economy the Federal Reserve is watching as it mulls the timing of the first interest rate cut, after it jacked up borrowing costs to a 23-year high to combat inflation. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly laid out how the job market has changed recently and what could be ahead at an event hosted by the Commonwealth Club World Affairs of California last week. \u201cSo far, the labor market has adjusted slowly, and the unemployment rate has only edged up. But we are getting nearer to a point where that benign outcome could be less likely,\u201d Daly said. \u201cFuture labor market slowing could translate into higher unemployment, as firms need to adjust not just vacancies but actual jobs.\u201d The US job market overall remains robust, but it has cooled some over the past year. The unemployment rate crept up to 4% in May, after remaining below that exceptionally low threshold for more than two years. The number of new applications for unemployment benefits, a proxy for layoffs, has trended up in recent weeks, with continuing claims last week reaching the highest level since November 2021. There were 8.1 million job openings in April, according to the latest government figures, down substantially from the record high of 12.2 million in March 2022. The Indeed report noted the change could be a sign of employer weakness or employer strength, underscoring the growing uncertainty in the labor market. Are employers losing their appetite for the cost of hiring full-time workers, or are they responding to a workforce eager for the flexibility a part-time schedule could offer? \u201cWhether out of competitive necessity to attract workers in a still-tight market with the promise of additional flexibility, and/or out of economic necessity as the economy cools and fewer worker hours are needed, the upshot for workers is clear: More part-time roles are available for those that desire or require them,\u201d the report said. The industries that were most likely to advertise part-time work as of May were beauty and wellness; personal care and home health; retail; food preparation and service; and sports, Indeed said. In May, the biggest increases in job postings offering part-time work from two years earlier were in beauty and wellness (+26.9%); marketing (+10.2%); hospitality and tourism (+9.9%); media and communications (+8.9%); and arts and entertainment (+7.9%). During the Great Recession from 2007 to 2009, part-time work rose sharply, according to research from the San Francisco Fed. Daniel Culbertson, the economist who authored the Indeed report, said the opposite was true when the economy was in the thick of a stunning recovery after the brief recession in 2020. \u201cThere was this rise in part-time work when the economy and the labor market were doing well coming out of the pandemic,\u201d Culbertson told CNN. US prices didn\u2019t rise last month for the first time since November Prices in the US didn\u2019t rise in May, lending to a welcome reprieve for cost-wary Americans and helping to bring inflation even closer to normal levels, reports my colleague Alicia Wallace. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index \u2014 a closely watched inflation gauge that the Federal Reserve uses to measure if the economy is approaching the central bank\u2019s 2% target \u2014 was unchanged from April and slowed to 2.6% for the 12 months ended in May from 2.7% the month before, according to Commerce Department data released Friday. Falling gas prices (down 2.1% for the month) and cheaper goods prices (down 0.4%) helped to slow overall inflation, according to the report. Food prices increased a modest 0.1%. Excluding energy and food \u2014 categories that tend to be quite volatile \u2014 the core PCE price index increased by 0.1% for the month, cooling to a fresh three-year low of 2.6% from 2.8% the month before. Friday\u2019s report came in line with expectations. The Commerce Department\u2019s monthly Personal Income and Outlays report also includes critical data on how Americans earn, spend and save. Consumer spending, which is a significant driver of economic activity, increased 0.2% for the month, accelerating from 0.1% the month before. Excluding inflation, real spending grew 0.3%.

{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_30_business_barbecue-grills-july-fourth-weber-traeger", "text": "Americans binged on grills during the pandemic, but the barbecue industry now faces a number of threats, including high meat prices and interest rates on top of economic uncertainty. Many feel no need to upgrade fairly recent purchases. Market leaders like higher-end grill manufacturer Traeger, once a pandemic darling, reported its latest quarter\u2019s grill sales were $76.8 million \u2014 a plunge from the $156.1 million the company raked in during the second quarter of 2021. Best-selling grill brand Weber has also seen its market share decline since 2020, according to data from TraQline. (Weber did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.) Home Depot also reported pressure in more expensive patio and garden equipment, including grills, during its first quarter in May, part of a larger dip in sales and earnings. And it\u2019s not just the big brands. Local stores that sell grills and other backyard cooking gear similarly reported demand dropping.  \u201cIt\u2019s trending down,\u201d said Brian Bushfield, general manager at West Coast BBQ Shop in San Diego, California. He noted a sluggish start to June and a slow Memorial Day, despite the holiday being one of the most popular occasions to purchase new grills. America might be less interested in buying grills, but they\u2019re still using them a ton. And there\u2019s evidence that the great BBQ sales evaporation may have hit a floor. Lockdown was a grill (seller)\u2019s best friend Americans\u00a0aren\u2019t\u00a0cooking outside on grills less. At least, that\u2019s according to statistics from the Hearth, Patio & Barbecue Association that reported 80% of U.S. homeowners owned a grill or smoker in 2023 \u2014 up from 64% in 2019.\u202fOf the new grill owners surveyed, 27% cited cooking more at home during Covid as the reason for their purchase. Other than barbecue grills, consumables like charcoal pellets and propane tanks make up Home Depot\u2019s grill category. Home Depot Senior Merchant of Grills Joe Downey said that these items drive a large portion of sales and that they are powered by new customers who purchased grills during the pandemic returning frequently to buy fuel. \u201cMore cooks are cooking at home than ever before,\u201d he said. The cost of food at home fell earlier this year as the cost of eating out rose, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that reported a 0.2% dip in grocery prices from March to April. Roy Morchian, owner of American Royal Hardware in Montclair, New Jersey, told CNN that the number of grills sold in 2020 rose to 160 from his store\u2019s yearly average range of 80 to 120 grills. And while their sales \u201chave come back to normal\u201d now closer to pre-pandemic levels, he notices new faces have joined familiar ones when purchasing propane tanks to fuel the Weber grills they stock. Most grill makers and retailers seem to agree that the pandemic pulled forward demand for grills and other long-lasting home equipment as people searched for ways to fill their days and entertain their families at home. San Diego Grill Pros owner Jessica Hernandez recounted \u201castronomical\u201d sales numbers and dubbed 2020 their \u201cunicorn year.\u201d Corey Martin, VP of Marketing at Texas Star Grill Shop described droves of people flocking to their Houston branch to buy grills and shelling out thousands of dollars for higher-end models like Weber\u2019s Genesis, which retails between $800 and $1,800, and Traeger\u2019s Timberline, which starts at about $3,000. \u201cIt was like a really busy grocery store,\u201d he said of his shop. But he and his staff knew that 2020 might be an aberration and the windfall might not last. \u201cIt would be stupid to be in a grill business and think that Covid was the new normal,\u201d Martin said. He said retailers who sell grills know it\u2019s a slow growth and seasonal industry. Downey sees Home Depot\u2019s grill sales stabilizing now following the lockdown-driven high. He anticipates that pandemic-purchased grills will reach the end of their life cycle and bring returning buyers with them in 2025. \u201cThe bottom has been reached and we are on the upswing in terms of getting closer to the end of [the grill] life cycle,\u201d he said. A key issue is a grill\u2019s life cycle: an average grill could last about five years and Americans purchased more than 21 million grills and smokers in 2020. It\u2019s clear that the replacement phase still hasn\u2019t kicked in quite yet. Reigniting the market Meanwhile, grill sellers are looking for ways to stoke demand. Beyond running familiar summer promotions for popular grilling days like Memorial Day and Father\u2019s Day, Downey said that Home Depot is trying to encourage young first-time homeowners to buy grills by introducing them to well-known brands at lower price points. Downey said somebody purchasing a $99 Weber kettle later might look to buy the compact Weber Spirit. \u201cThen as they grow, maybe they\u2019ll aspire to get into the Weber Genesis,\u201d he said, referencing the brand\u2019s more expensive model. Ace Hardware is running advertisements promoting its longstanding free assembly and delivery on grills \u2013- from brands such as Big Green Egg, Blackstone, Weber and Traeger \u2013 priced $399 and up, for Ace Rewards members, which is a free program to join. Traeger CEO Jeremy Andrus told CNN of the soft demand period \u201cWe are not waiting for this to end and riding it out.\u201d He pointed to Traeger hosting weekend cooking demonstrations outside of retail stores like Home Depot and Ace Hardware. \u201cIf we have an opportunity to get in front of the consumer and not only explain what a Traeger does but give them an opportunity to taste the food cooked off of a Traeger, it\u2019s a very effective conversion tool,\u201d he said. But firing up demand in a traditionally slow-growth industry is a challenge, according to Simeon Siegel, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets who follows Traeger. \u201cIf someone has a barbecue, they\u2019re not going to buy another simply because it\u2019s on sale,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, if someone doesn\u2019t need to buy a grill, there\u2019s only so many things companies can do to create demand.\u201d And economic trends haven\u2019t helped. Beef and veal prices rose the fastest among other food categories in 2024 and the US Department of Agriculture expects prices to rise another 4% this year. Some consumers are abandoning meat entirely. A year and a half ago, Bloomfield, New Jersey, resident Shikhiu Ing traded grilled meat for greens as a part of a conscious health decision. While he describes firing up his grill three times a week during the pandemic, he now finds less use for it after going mostly vegetarian. \u201cIt\u2019s non-functional right now. Grilling vegetables is kind of a chore to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just faster in the air fryer. Throw some broccoli in there, air fry. You got vegetables.\u201d Hot grill summers are here to stay? The grill industry isn\u2019t a stranger to slumps or about-face shifts in consumer demand. Andrus pointed to grill sales declining in the years following the 2008 recession before returning to growth for the next 10 years as a testament to the industry\u2019s resiliency. \u201cAmericans love to cook outdoors,\u201d he said. \u201cThey always have, they always will.\u201d For Newark, New Jersey, native Ayla Dunkley, cooking outdoors has been a family tradition. \u201cI learned how to grill from my grandfather and my father, so I learned everything from them,\u201d she said. Following her grandfather\u2019s advice, Dunkley replaces her Blackstone cooker every three to five years and waits until the summer season is over to shop at lower prices. Fourth of July cookouts will\u00a0cost $71.22 on average for 10 guests this summer, according to data from the American Farm Bureau Federation. That\u2019s up 5% from last year and up 30% from 2019. Yet Dunkley\u2019s annual plans to celebrate the holiday with her family in Pennsylvania are still on, grill in tow.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/business/barbecue-grills-july-fourth-weber-traeger/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_20_investing_microsoft-stock-record-high-altman-openai", "text": "Microsoft stock reached a record high on Monday after the company said that Sam Altman, former chief executive of OpenAI, will join the company to head its artificial intelligence innovation leg. Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing.

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. The stock market logged a gangbusters first half of the year. Can it last? The S&P 500 index gained a whopping 14.5% to close the first six months of 2024. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.8% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 18.1%. Like much of 2023, there\u2019s been one big driver behind those eye-popping gains: artificial intelligence. Much of the S&P 500\u2019s gains were concentrated in the Magnificent Seven big tech names, while other stocks lagged behind. Nvidia (NVDA), the leader of the pack, has pulled even further ahead. Shares of the chipmaker jumped 149% this year. Its valuation topped $3 trillion for the first time in June, when Nvidia was briefly the world\u2019s largest public company. That helped power the S&P 500 to 31 record high closes this year, despite hot inflation data derailing investors\u2019 expectations for when and how many times the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. Coming into this year, Wall Street projected that the Fed would ease rates as many as six times in 2024. But a stream of data showing sticky inflation forced investors to cool those bets, and the central bank has yet to pull rates back from their current 23-year high. Now, investors expect the Fed will cut rates up to three times in 2024, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, though the central bank has only penciled in one. Fresh data on Friday has given traders hope that inflation is on a downward path again. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed\u2019s favorite inflation gauge, slowed to 2.6% for the 12 months ended in May from the prior month. The inflation measure was unchanged from April, the first time it has held steady on a monthly basis since November. What could be in store for the stock market during the second half of 2024? Before the Bell spoke with Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Before the Bell: Was there anything that happened this year that surprised you? I was surprised by the slight reacceleration that we had in inflation and the fact that the market for the most part brushed it off. But again, even when you look down, especially within areas that are more tied to the economy that are more cyclical in nature, like small caps in particular, there has been a lot of breakage under the surface. I do think that it was a bit of a surprise to see the S&P 500 have a max drawdown of just 5.5% percent so far, even as you\u2019ve had the Fed on hold for much longer than expected but also inflation having accelerated. Do you think the stock rally\u2019s momentum can continue? I think it can as long as the rest of the market starts to catch its breath. Even though indexes like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have continued to make several all-time highs on a somewhat consistent basis, you\u2019ve seen more breakage under the surface: a fewer percentage of companies that are in an uptrend and that are participating in those new all-time highs. That kind of divergence, if it persists then into the second half of the year, would be a more worrying sign because it would start to somewhat eerily mimic what we had in 2021 in the second half of that year, where you were still recovering from a bear market. You were also recovering from a recession in 2020. It\u2019s not as extreme right now as we saw back then, but we\u2019re also in a hot investor sentiment environment. Frothiness has kind of come back in full force. What are the risk factors to the stock rally? The first one would definitely be any continued divergence in (market) breadth. The second one, though, would be if for some reason we did see a sharper slowdown in the labor market, and then that pushed the Fed to start an aggressive cutting cycle. All Fed cycles are different to some extent, but the one thing that is a little bit more consistent is when you start to look at the pace of cutting in so-called fast-cutting cycles, when they\u2019re taking rates down by maybe more than 25 basis points per meeting or at every single meeting, that tends to be more consistent with a recession and weakness in the market. Vice versa, a slow-cutting cycle where they\u2019re cutting maybe a handful of times within a year, that tends to be more supportive for the equity market because they\u2019re doing it because they can, not because they have to. Our view still is that it\u2019s probably going to be a slow-cutting cycle. That would broadly be supportive for the market, certainly supportive for the sectors that have been leading thus far. But I\u2019d be on watch for any weaker labor data than (the Fed has) been expecting, which ultimately pushes them to either cut sooner and/or cut more aggressively. That\u2019s becoming a bigger risk factor that\u2019s come into focus. Warren Buffett has finally revealed what will happen to his money after he dies Warren Buffett just changed how his considerable fortune will be spent following his death. Buffett, 93, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, told the Wall Street Journal he has again re-worked his will \u2014 and that he does not plan to continue donations to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation after he dies. He will put his wealth in a new charitable trust overseen by his three children, he said. \u201cThe Gates Foundation has no money coming after my death,\u201d Buffett told the Journal. Buffett told the Journal he has changed his will several times, and he put together the newest plan due to the trust he has in his children\u2019s values and how they will distribute his wealth. Each of Buffett\u2019s children has their own philanthropic organizations. \u201cI feel very, very good about the values of my three children, and I have 100% trust in how they will carry things out,\u201d Buffett told the Journal. Previously, Buffett had said his will stated that more than 99% of his estate was earmarked for philanthropic usage to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the four charities connected to his family: the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, Sherwood Foundation, Howard G. Buffett Foundation and NoVo Foundation. For now, however, Buffett is seemingly planning to continue donations to the Gates Foundation in his lifetime. Read more here.

From Monday, users will need to present a doctor\u2019s prescription to a pharmacist to buy vapes, and the choice will be limited to three flavors: mint, menthol and tobacco. Dozens of countries have banned disposable vapes, but with the ban on vape sales in shops, service stations and other small retailers, Australia has introduced \u201cworld leading\u201d laws, according to the government. Australian authorities say the move spells the end of colorful branding and fun flavors that authorities say was a ploy to get children hooked on nicotine. \u201cIt\u2019s not often that the parliament gets the opportunity to do something really meaningful and lasting for the health of young Australians,\u201d said Health Minister Mark Butler, after the country\u2019s parliament passed\u00a0the laws. However, under a political deal that was struck to secure the law\u2019s approval, the restrictions will ease in October, when only minors under 18 will need a prescription. Adults will be able to buy vapes in pharmacies, without a prescription \u2013 but the devices may be hard to find after some leading pharmacy chains declared they would refuse to stock them. \u201cPharmacists are healthcare professionals and community pharmacies do not want to supply this potentially harmful, highly addictive product without a prescription,\u201d said Anthony Tassone, the national vice president of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, which represents over 5,900 community pharmacies nationwide. Fears of a growing black market Australia\u2019s Greens Party had pushed for the amendments to allow\u00a0adults to buy vapes without a prescription because they do not support prohibition or the criminalization of vaping. \u201cThe prohibition of drugs has failed. The Greens are pleased that we have secured amendments to this legislation that will ensure that no person will be criminalised for personal possession of a vaping product,\u201d Greens Senator Jordon Steele-John said in a statement. It\u2019s not a criminal offense to possess vapes for personal use, but the import and sale of commercial quantities of vapes will attract large fines. Some fear the new laws will create a black market for vapes, much like one that exists for cigarettes in Australia, which imposes some of the highest tobacco taxes in the world. A box of 20 cigarettes costs around 35 Australian dollars ($23) \u2013 considerably more than in the United States and the United Kingdom. And the costs are expected to rise when the tobacco tax increases by another 5%\u00a0in September. Despite the rising cost of cigarettes, some fear that young vapers \u2013 having been locked out of the vape market \u2013 will turn to cigarettes to get their nicotine fix. \u201cThe reality at the moment is that vapes are actually still cheaper, but with the change in legislation that uncertainty, may be making them think, \u2018Well, I won\u2019t be able to get it. Maybe I\u2019ll move back to smoking, or maybe I\u2019ll start smoking,\u2019\u201d Hester Wilson, an addiction expert at the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners told national broadcaster, the ABC. Other countries are grappling with a rise in young people taking up vaping, but they\u2019re adopting various approaches to the issue. In June, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first non-tobacco-flavored e-cigarette products, drawing harsh criticism from pediatricians and anti-tobacco groups.  The FDA also paired with the Justice Department to create a task force to identify and target illegal sales and distribution of e-cigarettes in the US.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/business/australia-vaping-laws-ban-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_tech_meta-eu-competition-rules", "text": "Facebook parent Meta has been accused of breaking Europe\u2019s new digital competition rules over its \u201cpay or consent\u201d advertising model. Late last year, Meta (META)\u00a0launched\u00a0a service called \u201cSubscription for no ads,\u201d allowing European users of Facebook and Instagram to pay up to \u20ac12.99 ($14) a month for ad-free versions. The alternative is to accept versions with personalized ads. The European Commission said in a statement Monday that, in its preliminary view, \u201cthis binary choice forces users to consent to the (use) of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalized but equivalent version of Meta\u2019s social networks.\u201d If the provisional findings of the Commission\u2019s investigation are confirmed, the EU could hit Meta with a fine equivalent to 10% of its global annual revenue under its landmark Digital Markets Act. Based on the company\u2019s 2023 results, that would amount to $13.5 billion. Meta said it didn\u2019t accept the Commission\u2019s findings. \u201c\u2019Subscription for no ads\u2019 follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.\u201d The EU announcement comes a week after the Commission accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the DMA by preventing app developers from freely directing consumers to cheaper services. The regulators are also investigating Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) under the new law. The DMA, which came into force in March, requires dominant online platforms \u2014 so-called gatekeepers \u2014 to give users more choice, and rivals more opportunities to compete. Online platforms often collect personal data across their own and third-party services and use it in digital advertising services. Margrethe Vestager, a European Commissioner in charge of competition policy, noted in Monday\u2019s statement that Meta had been accumulating personal data of \u201cmillions of EU citizens over many years.\u201d \u201cWe want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalized ads experience,\u201d she said. Michael Koenig, a senior official at the Commission, said Meta must offer users an alternative to \u201cfull\u201d ad personalization that \u201cdoes not rely on this personal data and which is then automatically less personalized and still available to them.\u201d \u201cThen Meta is free to keep a third option, which is a subscription not to see ads at all, or a fourth option which may have some premium features,\u201d he told journalists. The Commission is due to conclude its probe into Meta by late March next year.

{"id": "2024_06_30_business_boeing-plea-deal", "text": "The US Justice Department is nearing an agreement with Boeing that would include a corporate monitor and a fine in exchange for a guilty plea to criminal charges, according to lawyers representing the families of victims of two fatal 737 Max crashes, who harshly rebuked the offer as a \u201csweetheart deal.\u201d The criminal charges and potential plea deal come after repeated safety failures at Boeing that have resulted in multiple federal investigations and a sharp rebuke from airlines, customers, lawmakers and regulators. Criminal charges against a major corporation like Boeing are rare and would represent a serious blow to the company\u2019s already\u00a0precarious financial situation\u00a0and further damage its\u00a0battered reputation. But the victims\u2019 families said they were furious that Boeing may avoid trial, saying the government is letting the company off the hook for the deaths of their loved ones. \u201cI can tell you that the families are very unhappy and angered with DOJ\u2019s decisions and proposal,\u201d said Robert Clifford, lead counsel in the civil litigation against Boeing, in a statement. \u201cThere is no accountability, no admission that Boeing\u2019s admitted crime caused the 346 deaths, and the families will most certainly object before Judge Reed O\u2019Connor and ask that he reject the plea if Boeing accepts.\u201d Clifford and Paul Cassell represent many family members of the 2018 Lion Air crash and\u00a02019 Ethiopian Air crash\u00a0victims of Boeing 737 Max jets. They and some of the families they represent were briefed by the Justice Department Sunday about the plea deal. The deal would include three years of probation, a \u201csmall\u201d fine and and a monitor to ensure safety compliance, Cassell told CNN. Other specific terms of the proposed offer were not immediately known, and CNN has not reviewed the proposal first-hand. Bloomberg first reported the potential plea deal Sunday. Boeing declined to comment, and the Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment. Violating Boeing\u2019s previous agreement Last month, the Justice Department notified Boeing that its recent string of safety failures and production problems constituted a breach of the terms of\u00a0its\u00a02021 agreement in which the company avoided criminal charges for two fatal 737 Max crashes. A\u00a0door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines flight\u00a0shortly after takeoff in January, and the investigations that followed revealed a series of quality errors and safety gaps. As a result, the Department of Justice said Boeing is subject to criminal prosecution, but it has not publicly announced its decision about whether it will prosecute the case. Last week, prosecutors urged the Justice Department to file criminal charges. Boeing will have by the end of the week to determine whether to accept the plea deal or go to trial. The deadline for the Justice Department to file criminal charges in the case is July 7. Cassell said the families were upset that the Justice Department deal excluded the prosecution of individuals at Boeing. \u201cThe deal will not acknowledge, in any way, that Boeing\u2019s crime killed 346 people.\u00a0It also appears to rest on the idea that Boeing did not harm any victim,\u201d Cassell said in a statement. Although the Justice Department acknowledged the families\u2019 strong desire to take Boeing\u2019s criminal case to trial, the families\u2019 lawyers said the Department of Justice feared it would be unable to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 the higher standard of proof necessary for a conviction in a criminal trial. A broken safety culture More than a dozen whistleblowers have come forward against Boeing in recent years, and the number has grown substantially since the\u00a0door plug incident in January. Last week, for example, a whistleblower from a contractor for Spirit Aerosystems, a Boeing manufacturing partner, said he notified the company of wide gaps in a key part of 787 Dreamliner planes that posed \u201ccatastrophic\u201d danger to passengers. As part of its plan to shore up its safety program, Boeing said it was looking to repurchase Spirit to bring manufacturing of its planes fully in house. Boeing spun off Spirit in 2005. Boeing and Spirit reportedly came to terms on a deal Sunday, according to Reuters, but the deal has not been publicly disclosed and Boeing declined to comment to CNN. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board have opened multiple investigations into Boeing because of its ongoing quality and safety failures. The FAA has said a\u00a0six-week audit of Boeing\u2019s facilities\u00a0conducted in the late winter found multiple problems with Boeing\u2019s production practices. A separate\u00a0report\u00a0found \u201cgaps\u201d in Boeing\u2019s safety culture, including a disconnect between management and employees, and fears among employees about retaliation for reporting safety concerns. Boeing\u2019s CEO Dave Calhoun earlier this month\u00a0apologized for Boeing\u2019s recent safety failures\u00a0in testimony delivered to a Senate committee but pushed back on claims the company retaliated against those who brought safety issues to light. Calhoun said Boeing is \u201cfar from perfect,\u201d and acknowledged the company will not easily regain the public\u2019s trust.

{"id": "2024_07_01_cars_electric-car-battery-charge", "text": "A British startup may have found the answer to one of the frustrations of driving an electric car \u2014 waiting around for the battery to charge. Nybolt, based in Cambridge, has developed a new 35kWh lithium-ion battery that was charged from 10% to 80% in just over four and a half minutes in its first live demonstration last week. That is much faster than the 20 minutes or so it currently takes some electric cars using a fast charger, such as a Tesla (TSLA) Supercharger. It is also much closer to the two minutes it takes to fill up the average gasoline-powered car. \u201cOur extensive research here in the UK and US has unlocked a novel battery technology that is ready and scalable right now,\u201d Nyobolt\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Sai Shivareddy, said in a statement Friday. \u201cWe are enabling the electrification of new products and services currently considered inviable or impossible.\u201d Nyobolt\u2019s technology builds on a decade of research led by University of Cambridge battery scientist Clare Grey and Cambridge-educated Shivareddy, the company said. Key to its batteries\u2019 ability to be charged super-fast without a big impact on their longevity is a design that means they generate less heat. It also makes them safer as overheating can cause a lithium-ion battery to catch fire and explode. In addition, the materials used to make the batteries\u2019 anodes allow for a faster transfer of electrons. Nyobolt is currently in talks to sell its batteries to eight electric car manufacturers. At 35 kWh, the battery is much smaller than the 85 kWh in a more typical American electric vehicle (EV). Yet the technology may be used in larger battery packs in the future. Comparatively long charging times are a major drawback of EVs currently on the market. They slow down road trips and they\u2019re an inconvenience for owners who can\u2019t charge their cars at home. Nyobolt\u2019s innovation, tested in the firm\u2019s sports car prototype, is particularly encouraging for commercial EV fleets and drivers relying on electric cars in their jobs, according to Paul Marchment, consultant at Arval, a vehicle leasing specialist owned by BNP Paribas. However, another barrier to faster adoption of EVs in the United States and Europe is a lack of public charging infrastructure. Jack Evans, a motoring specialist at Blackball Media, welcomed the news about Nyobolt\u2019s battery, which was tested on a track Thursday using a 350kW DC ultra-rapid charger of the kind that is hard to find on UK roads. \u201cThe units used to charge the Nyobolt battery are few and far between in the UK, so in order for this to really make an impact, there needs to be an increase in the provision of ultra-rapid chargers,\u201d he said. Shivareddy told CNN that the number of fast chargers was rising both in the US and the European Union, and that he expects to \u201cpretty much have them everywhere\u201d by the end of the decade. In North America, three out of four fast chargers are Tesla\u2019s Superchargers, and virtually every big automaker in the US has committed to making EVs\u00a0compatible with Tesla\u2019s charging technology, known as the North American Charging Standard. Nyobolt\u2019s battery is compatible with a Supercharger, the startup told CNN. \u201cWe would love to work with Tesla and other leading (manufacturers) to bring our vision to life \u2014 with the aim of making recharging times the same as refueling times,\u201d Shivareddy said. \u201cThis would require industry to collaborate for the rollout of a large number of such high-power chargers, along with the grid/off-grid power supply.\u201d Not ready for prime time just yet Independent testing of Nyobolt\u2019s batteries by what it called a leading global manufacturer found that they can achieve over 4,000 fast-charge cycles, equivalent to 600,000 miles (965,600 kilometers), while retaining more than 80% of capacity, Nyobolt said in its Friday statement. \u201cThis is many multiples higher than the warranties of much larger EV batteries on the road today,\u201d it noted. William Kephart, an e-mobility specialist at consultancy P3 Group and a former engineer, said EV batteries of the kind Nyobolt has developed could \u201ctheoretically\u201d be charged as fast as the firm is promising, but the challenge was manufacturing such batteries on an industrial scale. A crucial chemical element in Nyobolt\u2019s batteries is niobium but, as Kephart pointed out, last year only an estimated 83,000 tonnes (94,500 tons) was mined worldwide. Compare that with graphite, commonly used as anode material in lithium-ion batteries: an estimated 1.6 million tonnes (1.8 million tons) was produced in 2023. In addition, there are currently \u201ca lot of unknowns\u201d with the niobium battery technology, he told CNN. \u201cThe industry will work it out\u2026 (but) it\u2019s not seen by the industry as a scalable technology just yet,\u201d he added. Besides slow charging, obstacles to EV ownership in the US and Europe include so-called range anxiety \u2014 the concern that the car will not have enough battery charge to reach its destination, especially acute during long drives \u2014 and EVs\u2019 higher average price compared with new conventional cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/cars/electric-car-battery-charge/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_30_business_westjet-strike-flight-cancellations-update", "text": "Labor negotiations between WestJet, Canada\u2019s second-largest airline, and the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association remain at a standstill after the union called a surprise strike last week, forcing more than 400 flight cancellations and delays over the weekend. The union, which represents nearly 700 aircraft engineers and technicians, went on strike Friday after negotiations over the group\u2019s first collective bargaining agreement with the airline broke down over what it said was WestJet\u2019s \u201crefusal to negotiate.\u201d The strike follows back-and-forth talks between the union and the airline stretching back to September 2023, when representatives met for an initial bargaining session. At the meeting, according to a memo from the association, union representatives raised concerns including \u201cfurloughs out of seniority order, irregularities in pay scale, and work privileges that have been eliminated without notice or rationale.\u201d In addition to wage increases, the union is seeking protections for certain positions and improved benefits such as health care. On Sunday, the union told CNN \u201cthe parties are separated by a first-year economic difference of approximately 7%, less than $8 million.\u201d WestJet has repeatedly condemned the strike, which comes during a long holiday weekend in Canada. The company says the strike will affect about 250,000 travelers\u2019 plans. WestJet said in a statement Friday it has sought \u201cimmediate intervention by the Minister of Labour and the Canada Industrial Relations Board.\u201d The airline says it has had to cancel more than 410 flights between Thursday and Saturday. Data from flight tracker FlightAware shows WestJet on Sunday had canceled at least 343 flights, constituting 77% of its fleet. The airline\u2019s regional subsidiary, WestJet Encore, has canceled at least 80 flights. Airports across Canada are also facing major service suspensions. At Calgary International Airport, 42% of outbound flights and 40% of inbound flights have been canceled. Toronto Pearson, Vancouver and Edmonton international airports are also affected. But in an update to members on Sunday shared with CNN, the union announced the industrial relations board ruled the strike was lawful, as the board continues to mediate negotiations. \u201cAlthough the compulsory arbitration imposed by the Minister of Labour is scheduled to move forward on an expedited basis, the CIRB has held that, until that process is completed, we are entitled to continue our legal strike,\u201d the union said. The industrial relations board has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. The union told CNN it had made its last offer to the airline on Thursday, and since then WestJet has not responded or given any indication of future bargaining dates. The union also detailed a drawn out and unproductive mediation process over the weekend. \u201cAt 1:00 a.m. Eastern on Saturday, June 29, after waiting hours in a virtual breakout room, the mediators returned to inform us that WestJet executives had decided to \u2018call it a night,\u2019\u201d the union said in its update.

{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_business_tractor-supply-dei-roles-goals", "text": "Tractor Supply Company has eliminated its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives as part of what the retail chain says is a push to distance itself from \u201cnonbusiness activities\u201d after conservative backlash from some of its customer base. In a news release Thursday, Tractor Supply, which advertises itself as the country\u2019s \u201clargest rural lifestyle retailer,\u201d said it will stop sponsoring activities like \u201cpride festivals and voting campaigns\u201d and would be cutting DEI roles and \u201cretire (its) current DEI goals while still ensuring a respectful environment.\u201d \u201cWe have heard from customers that we have disappointed them,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe have taken this feedback to heart.\u201d The about-face comes less than a month after right-wing commentator Robby Starbuck attacked the company\u2019s LGBTQ-inclusive stance and DEI hiring initiatives in a series of posts on X. Starbuck, who in 2022 launched a failed bid for Tennessee\u2019s 5th Congressional District, called on customers to boycott Tractor Supply and contact its corporate leadership. After the policy pivot was announced, Starbuck took to X again, calling the move a \u201cmassive victory\u201d and \u201cthe single biggest boycott win of our lifetime.\u201d Shaun Harper, a professor of business, public policy and education at the University of Southern California, told CNN one reason for the conservative backlash was the fact Tractor Supply failed to tailor its DEI policy to the culture in which it operates. The Brentwood, Tennessee-based company, which bills itself as the largest supporter of the National FFA Organization, a non-profit supporting agricultural education, has deep ties to rural communities across 49 states. Harper says Tractor Supply\u2019s inclusion policies should have been attuned to that specific cultural context. \u201cYou can\u2019t say you\u2019re going to try to do at Tractor Supply what they do at the Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California \u2014 that\u2019s definitely not going to work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what I call \u2018situated DEI.\u2019 I would say start with an emphasis on expanding opportunities for low income people, expanding access to farming for women in rural contexts, and helping people understand how more women and more people of color in the farming industry benefits everyone. And helping them understand that the diversification of the farming industry, with women and people of color doesn\u2019t necessarily have to entail a reduction and opportunities for White male farmers.\u201d Still, activists and experts say Tractor Supply\u2019s backtrack is a blow against civil rights and LGBTQ+ protections for employees and customers. \u201cHomophobia, transphobia, sexism, gender discrimination, workplace sexual harassment, ableism, size-ism and racism are not going to eliminate themselves,\u201d said Harper. \u201cIn the absence of good policy and programs within companies, the danger is that those long-standing problems are going to become exacerbated. There\u2019s going to be more conflict between and among employees, and customers who represent various diverse groups.\u201d Tractor Supply also said it would \u201cno longer submit data to the Human Rights Campaign,\u201d one of the biggest LGBTQ+ non-profit advocacy groups in the United States. It was one of more than 1,300 businesses to participate in the HRC\u2019s Corporate Equality Index, a benchmarking survey and report measuring policies and practices relating to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. In 2023, the company earned a near-perfect score of 95/100 for instating workplace protections and benefits taking LGBTQ+ employees into account, providing inclusivity training to workers, and performing outreach to the LGBTQ+ community. \u201cTractor Supply Co is turning its back on their own neighbors with this shortsighted decision,\u201d Eric Bloem, vice president of Programs and Corporate Advocacy at the Human Rights Campaign, told CNN in a statement Saturday. \u201cLGBTQ+ people live in every zip code in this country, including rural communities. We are shoppers, farmers, veterans and agriculture students. Companies from every industry work closely with us to be sure their employees and customers are respected, valued and can get the job done for their workforce and shareholders. This is why the Tractor Supply \u2014 and most of the country\u2019s biggest employers \u2014 have worked with us for years to create inclusive policies and practices. Caving to far right extremists is only going to hurt the same folks that these businesses rely on.\u201d A trend of bowing to anti-LGBTQ+ voices The policy reversal is part of a wider trend of corporate vacillation over LGBTQ+ inclusion. In the face of anti-LGBTQ backlash threatening companies\u2019 bottom line, several household brands have backed down in their support of inclusivity. Last year, Bud Light\u2019s partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked an anti-trans backlash and a monthslong boycott of the beer brand, throughout which the company failed to take a firm stance in support of Mulvaney and the transgender community. The boycott and the subsequent tepid response lost parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev as much as $1.4 billion in sales, as well as its credibility with a major LGBTQ+ non-profit. Last month, retailer Target said it will limit how many stores would carry its Pride-themed collection for adults after a boycott from right-wing activists last summer led to a sharp dip in sales. While bowing to consumer backlash might seem like the safest strategy to claw back revenue lost in a boycott, it can also be shortsighted. Harper argues few companies consider the potential cost of litigation from customers and employees. \u201cSo much money gets wasted on settlements or damages for discrimination and harassment,\u201d he said. \u201cI want companies to not just think about sales, but also about the cost of litigation, as well as the reputational costs. Those are the parts that business leaders aren\u2019t thinking about as they are folding on DEI.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/business/tractor-supply-dei-roles-goals/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/02/2024", "section": "business"}}
