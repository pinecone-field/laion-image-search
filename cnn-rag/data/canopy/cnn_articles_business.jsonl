{"id": "2024_07_02_media_biden-mental-fitness", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s White House repeatedly and aggressively shot down reports\u00a0on\u00a0the president\u2019s age and any possible limitations\u00a0on his ability to perform all the duties of his office. But after his shaky debate performance last week, in which Biden routinely struggled to\u00a0get his point across, some in the White House press corps say they wish they had pushed harder to tell the story. In June, when the Wall Street Journal published a\u00a0lengthy piece\u00a0on President Joe Biden\u2019s mental\u00a0state, the newspaper\u00a0got\u00a0slammed.\u00a0The White House, its allies, and\u00a0some in the media\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources\u00a0\u2013\u00a0criticized the Journal for quoting mostly Republican political foes on the record, who had a clear political motive to damage Biden\u2019s image. No Democrats were quoted on the record making those allegations, and several Democrats complained their on-the-record quotes praising Biden\u2019s sharpness were not included. The\u00a0Journal defended its reporting at the time. Last week\u2019s debate on CNN laid bare many of the concerns the Journal\u2019s reporting had raised \u2013 that the president has good days and bad days but can sometimes seem to slip up. A New York Times report on Tuesday raised similar concerns by those who have recently been in the room with Biden. The Times reported Biden has more frequent \u201clapses,\u201d although at other times he appears sharp. After Biden\u2019s lackluster performance last week, some are questioning whether the White House press corps dropped the ball on fully covering Biden\u2019s limitations. Biden\u2019s\u00a0age issue is not secret or new. Nearly every media outlet has reported on\u00a0growing concerns about\u00a0Biden\u2019s age well before the debate. The White House in the past has complained that the coverage is disproportionate, and that the media is spending more time covering Biden\u2019s age than his accomplishments as president versus former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies. The media has faced accusations that it has not covered Biden\u2019s mental fitness more aggressively because it wants to prop up the campaign in some way \u2013 an accusation the White House reporters CNN spoke to denied. Several White House reporters\u00a0told CNN that\u00a0the\u00a0coverage\u00a0of Biden\u2019s age and his mental stamina\u00a0should have\u00a0pushed harder. They cited several difficulties in doing so before the debate \u2013 from the obvious political motivations of sources who either want to protect Biden\u2019s image or project a certain image, to the blowback from pursuing such reports, especially from the White House and Democrats. A difficult task Like all past presidents, Biden has good days and bad days. It\u00a0can be tricky to report on something as difficult to define as a person aging, when his opponent\u00a0is a convicted felon, who regularly lies and has threatened to use the government to go after his political opponents. Still, some reporters said the press corps\u00a0could\u00a0have done a better job\u00a0covering\u00a0Biden\u2019s physical and mental state. The failure of the media, one White House reporter said,\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0pushing more aggressively\u00a0into Biden\u2019s abilities after the release of the Robert Hurr report in February, which called Biden a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d Biden\u2019s age was also a right-wing talking point for years, something the White House was quick to point out to reporters,\u00a0which\u00a0may have inadvertently turned off any serious investigation. For example, deceptively edited clips of Biden from the G7 spread widely by right-wing media figures were made to seem as though he was aimlessly \u201cwandering off\u201d from fellow world leaders when really, he was speaking to parachutists who had just landed during a demonstration. \u201cThe right-wing media was calling him senile from day one, and that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cThen whenever you report on the age you were in some ways solidifying, giving credence to some people that were actually of bad faith.\u201d All the White House reporters who spoke to CNN for this piece chose to speak anonymously so they could speak more freely about their relationship with the White House. Keeping the president at a distance Reporters said the White House has not made the press corps\u2019 job easy:\u00a0The White House has put up guardrails around Biden, they say, and\u00a0he does not engage in as many interviews or planned press conferences\u00a0as previous presidents. At those events,\u00a0the press might be able to gauge how he\u2019s doing on the spot, without prepared remarks. \u201cThey keep him at arm\u2019s length, and he rarely does extended interviews,\u201d the reporter said of the White House,\u00a0although he acknowledged Biden has started giving more interviews as of late. Biden has done fewer interviews and formal press conferences than his most recent predecessors, according to data compiled by\u00a0Martha Joynt Kumar,\u00a0professor emerita of political science at Towson University who chronicles the presidents\u2019 interactions with the press. But on quick and informal interactions with the press, like shouted questions on the way to his helicopter or plane, Biden\u00a0as of this week has had 588 interactions, Kumar reports, second only to Trump when compared to recent presidents. But those interactions are not the same as an extended press conference, reporters noted. On Tuesday, ABC News announced Biden would sit down with George Stephanopoulos for an interview, his first since the debate. The White House press shop has also been very \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cfairly successful\u201d in mitigating coverage of concerns over the president\u2019s age,\u00a0said\u00a0another White House reporter who works for a different publication. \u201c[B]erating reporters who bring them reporting about age concerns, bemoaning that it\u2019s all anyone writes about (clearly, it\u2019s not) and often attacking pieces after they run,\u201d the reporter told CNN. \u201cI think that\u2019s left some folks to conclude that these stories are too painful to report or that they should pick their spots more. It\u2019s clear the age stories that have angered the White House (and the liberal Twittersphere) the most.\u201d Alex Thompson, a White House reporter for Axios, said on CNN the day after the debate that \u201cthe White House\u2019s response every single time\u00a0it\u00a0has come up for three-and-a-half years has been to deflect, to gaslight, to not tell the truth \u2013 not just to reporters, not just to other Democrats, but even at times to themselves about the president\u2019s limitations at his age.\u201d Still, this White House\u2019s recent conduct with reporters pales in comparison to Trump\u2019s team, which has done everything from revoking press access to reporters they disagree with, to calling reporters the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d The White House declined to comment. Aging doesn\u2019t happen all at once Aging is also not a sudden moment.\u00a0That makes it trickier to report on. \u201cTo some extent, the decline has appeared to be gradual \u2014 hard to notice from day to day \u2014 and that\u2019s perhaps made it harder for reporters to determine when is the right moment to write something,\u201d one of the reporters said. Just a few days before the debate, Biden held a press conference at the G7 alongside Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelensky that passed off without anything of note in Biden\u2019s demeanor. But reporters pointed out (and have published stories noting) that the president has been using teleprompters at most big events, even fundraisers where in the past he might not have. He has also started to use the lower stairs to board Air Force One. Last year, The New York Times published a lengthy piece on the \u201ccomplicated reality of America\u2019s oldest president,\u201d which looked at some of those accommodations and concerns for his age, but also the moments where he showed stamina and vigor. Some reporters said that there has been a distinct change\u00a0within the last year, and that the press corps should have reported more aggressively on the accommodations made for the president. \u201cI think the press, most of the White House press, did suffer from a bit of lack of curiosity,\u201d one of the reporters said. Look who you\u2019re up against Biden\u2019s allies will often question coverage of the president\u2019s age, questioning why reporters focus on the president\u2019s age and mental lucidity and not on Trump\u2019s\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who, at 78,\u00a0was observed falling asleep during his hush money trial, has made his own major verbal flubs and bizarre statements, and regularly spouts complete falsehoods. \u201cIt makes sense to reflect on this now and ask whether we missed or, really, under-reported the story of Biden\u2019s age and decline. But it\u2019s complicated,\u201d one of the reporters said. \u201cThe fact that the political alternative to Biden is an authoritarian who sparked an insurrection and is a convicted felon does not mean that the press is failing American democracy to focus on Biden\u2019s obvious frailty.\u201d One of the reporters said the media can, and do, report on both. Biden\u2019s allies, however, say too much attention is placed on Biden\u2019s age and not on the threat Trump could pose to American democracy. But the reporters say they can, and should, do both. \u201cJust because you are reporting on Biden age, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not reporting on Trump\u2019s lies.\u00a0 I find that argument silly, and it seems one design towards like producing a certain outcome in the election, rather than like an honest reporting,\u201d one of the reporters said. The outlets that had received harsh blowback for their previous reports on Biden\u2019s lucidity now feel justified. A source familiar with the staff behind the Wall Street Journal\u2019s report said that when the piece first published, the reporters were approached by people with sympathy asking how they\u2019re doing \u201cas if something terrible had just happened,\u201d the source said. After the debate, the reporters started to get messages saying they were right.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/media/biden-mental-fitness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_business_bill-hwang-archegos", "text": "In lower Manhattan, a jury is now weighing a case against a little-known investor who made it big, lost everything, and briefly brought Wall Street to its knees. But the story of Bill Hwang and his trading firm\u2019s colossal failure is more than a rags-to-riches-to-rags tale \u2014 it is also a giant red flag about the vulnerabilities of the financial system that persist more than 15 years after Wall Street\u2019s everyday dark arts ravaged the global economy. Here\u2019s the deal: In March of 2021, as most of us were lining up for Covid vaccines, Bill Hwang\u2019s so-called family office \u2014 an unregulated firm that works like a hedge fund \u2014 imploded in a matter of days, sparking a brief but acute freakout in financial markets. Seemingly without anyone noticing, Hwang had managed to amass huge positions in a handful of companies \u2014 including ViacomCBS, Tencent and Discovery (now Warner Bros. Discovery, CNN\u2019s parent company). His positions were so large that when the stocks started falling, it had a seismic effect on the market. According to prosecutors, the collapse of Archegos (pronounced ar-KAY-gos) cost shareholders $100 billion and left major banks with $10 billion in losses. Hwang and his CFO, Patrick Halligan, were later charged with racketeering conspiracy and securities fraud. And on Tuesday, after a two-month trial in New York federal court, the case was handed over to a jury that will decide their fate. What happened? There are two official versions of the Archegos saga that emerged from the trial. Prosecutors say that the firm used financial instruments called \u201ctotal return swaps\u201d to gain exposure to stocks without actually owning them (a legal but controversial strategy), all while lying to the banks it was borrowing from (not legal) to conceal its massive positions and artificially inflating the stocks\u2019 value (also not legal). Hwang\u2019s attorneys counter that Archegos\u2019 aggressive trades were actually commonplace and perfectly legal, and that he believed in the stocks he was buying. It can\u2019t be a pump-and-dump scheme if the investor never dumps the shares, after all. What happened to Hwang and his firm was an aggressive bet that went south due to a perfect storm of market movements that left the firm unable to meet margin calls from its lenders. That forced the banks to sell Hwang\u2019s holdings, which caused the stocks\u2019 value to plummet, and the chaos to ensue. If found guilty, Hwang and Halligan could face as much as 20 years in prison under federal sentencing guidelines. Big picture The details of the Archegos trial may appear arcane to outsiders. Even the judge admonished prosecutors for \u201cboring the jury to tears,\u201d according to Bloomberg. But the Archegos episode is one of the more significant white-collar cases to emerge since the financial crisis. The case has shown the world, once again, what happens when two giant market risks collide in a novel way, Josh Naftalis, a former prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, told me. Before Archegos, market watchers knew unregulated family offices were a problem, and they knew that swaps going unreported was a problem. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think anyone put two and two together to say you could just use these two and light a dumpster on fire,\u201d said Naftalis, now with the law firm Pallas Partners. Regardless of the verdict, the case also underscores the massive risks that Wall Street megabanks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley continue to pile on, said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of the non-profit Better Markets, in an interview. Even if Wang is convicted, he said, there\u2019s another culprit in the saga getting off easy: the taxpayer-backed banks that enabled the trading in the first place. \u201cFifteen years after the global financial crash, we still have gross under-regulation of non-banks, and we have Wall Street megabanks engaged in high-risk activities that aren\u2019t properly regulated,\u201d Kelleher told me. \u201cWe still have a long, long way to go.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/business/bill-hwang-archegos/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

Filings show that the company took on about $325 million in debt following its purchase of Redbox in 2022 from private equity giant Apollo Global Management. The plan was to make it into an entertainment conglomerate, combining the DVD rental business with its free streaming services, like Crackle, the entertainment platform once owned by Sony.

{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices", "text": "Actress Judy Garland never recorded her voice to read an audiobook of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but you\u2019ll soon be able to hear her rendition of the children\u2019s novel that inspired the movie nonetheless. Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

The other believes EVs will be an economic disaster for America and that the nation should to produce and burn more oil. But as of Saturday, Musk is now publicly endorsing Trump\u2019s presidential reelection bid. And the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported Monday that Musk is now planning on supporting Trump\u2019s presidential campaign by committing $45 million a month to a new super PAC backing the former president. The donations, if they come to pass, are a significant development in not only the presidential campaign, but also the relationship between the two men, who both have fervent support among millions of fans who stand ready to believe most anything they say. Musk has given money to candidates from both parties in the past, including $5,000 to Barack Obama in April of 2011. He used to be primarily a Democratic donor, but those relatively paltry sums pale in comparison to the amount he is now reportedly donating to the Republican presidential candidate. He has said for several years the Democratic party has moved too far to the left for him to support many of its candidates. Musk didn\u2019t comment directly on the Journal report, but he did use a meme of people dressed as African wildebeests with the title \u201cFake Gnus,\u201d suggesting the report was incorrect. And he tweeted soon after the assassination attempt on Trump Saturday \u201cI fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.\u201d But Musk responded \u201cyeah\u201d to an account he interacts with frequently, @EndWokeness, which said that Musk \u201cwent from being an Obama voter to pledging $180 million to elect DJT. The woke left really f*cked up. Badly.\u201d The super PAC, called America PAC, aims to help register voters, persuade people to vote early and to ask for mail-in ballots in swing states, one person told the Journal. Beyond his financial support for the Trump campaign, Musk, with 190 million followers on his platform X, is possibly one of the world\u2019s most-followed \u201cinfluencers,\u201d in addition to having the greatest net worth on the planet. He has millions of fans \u2013 a recent Tesla annual meeting had the feeling of its own political rally, with shareholders telling him things like \u201cWe love you all from our bottom of the heart, we love you so much, Elon.\u201d The shareholders at that meeting voted 84% in favor of restoring the most lucrative pay package ever given to a CEO, with stock options worth $48 billion at the time of the meeting. A judge in Delaware had previously stripped him of that package. Asked at that meeting about his relationship with Trump, and Trump having nice things to say about Tesla even as he attacks EVs, Musk replied, \u201cI can be persuasive.\u201d \u201cI mean, I have had some conversations with him and he just called me out of the blue for no reason, I don\u2019t know why, but he does,\u201d Musk continued. \u201cAnd it\u2019s like he\u2019s very nice when he calls and I was like, electric cars, I think are pretty good for the future. America is the leader in electric cars, buy American stuff. And I think he actually \u2013 a lot of his friends now have Teslas and they all love it. And he\u2019s a huge fan of the Cybertruck. So I think those may be contributing factors, yeah.\u201d Relations haven\u2019t always been so friendly between the two. Musk quit two White House business councils he served on early in 2017 after Trump announced America would withdraw from Paris climate accord. \u201cClimate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\u201d he tweeted at that time. But for the last several years Musk has repeatedly shown support for Trump \u2013 or opposition to President Joe Biden. Soon after Musk purchased the social media platform then known as Twitter in the fall of 2022, he restored Trump\u2019s Twitter account. He has complained that Twitter was improperly censoring anti-Biden stories under its previous ownership, although Twitters\u2019s own lawyers later challenged that conclusion in a court filing. Tesla, the greatest source of Musk\u2019s planet-leading net worth, has benefited from subsidies passed under the Biden Administration, providing tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV buyers. But those tax credits also help established automakers seeking to sell their own EVs. Musk recently tweeted the EV subsidies passed under Biden actually helped its rivals more than Tesla. \u201cTake away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,\u201d he tweeted early Tuesday. \u201cAlso, remove subsidies from all industries!\u201d While Musk is right that some of the industries he criticizes, specifically coal and oil, receive their own massive government subsidies, his tweet doesn\u2019t acknowledge that much of his wealth has come from government support of Tesla and SpaceX, one of his other companies that depends upon government contracts to operate.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/business/musk-trump-support/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_13_success_gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy", "text": "Employees\u2019 negative daily emotions and lack of well-being can ultimately hurt worker engagement \u2013 and the economy, according to a new report released this week. Gallup, in its \u201cState of the Global Workplace,\u201d estimates that low employee engagement costs the global economy $8.9 trillion, or 9% of global GDP. The report includes findings from its latest annual World Poll, which surveyed 128,278 employees in more than 140 countries last year. That poll found that roughly 20% of workers globally reported feeling lonely, angry or sad on a daily basis. And 41% on average say they feel stress. Those most likely to say they feel lonely were younger workers (22%), employees who worked remotely full-time (25%) and those who felt most disengaged on the job (31%). While work isn\u2019t always the cause of a person\u2019s negative daily emotions, employers should still be concerned. That\u2019s because work can either improve or worsen employees\u2019 well-being. On the one hand,\u00a0the Gallup report noted,\u00a0\u201cwhen employees find their work and work relationships meaningful, employment is associated with high levels of daily enjoyment and low levels of all negative daily emotions. Notably, half of employees who are engaged at work are thriving in life overall.\u201d On the other, researchers found that being disengaged at work can negatively affect a person\u2019s wellbeing as much as \u2014 or more than \u2014 not having a job at all. \u201cEmployees who dislike their jobs tend to have high levels of daily stress and worry, as well as elevated levels of all other negative emotions,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOn many wellbeing items (stress, anger, worry, loneliness), being actively disengaged at work is equivalent to or worse than being unemployed.\u201d Engaged managers help workers thrive The poll found that last year only 23% of employees were engaged at work, unchanged from the year prior. Gallup defines an engaged employee as someone \u201chighly involved in and enthusiastic about their work and workplace. They are psychological \u2018owners,\u2019 drive performance and innovation, and move the organization forward.\u201d But those who said they were not engaged rose by 3 percentage points to 62%. These are employees characterized as \u201cpsychologically unattached to their work and company. Because their engagement needs are not being fully met, they are putting time but not energy or passion into their work.\u201d Engagement levels are highest in so-called \u201cbest practice\u201d organizations, where three-fourths of managers on average are engaged as well as seven in 10 non-managers, Gallup said. Their best practices include leaders\u2019 emphasizing well-being at work and in life; and putting a high priority on manager hiring and development. The manager piece of the equation is especially crucial. \u201c[W]hen managers are engaged, employees are more likely to be engaged,\u201d the report said. And, it added, \u201chigh-engagement business units are likely to see significantly higher employee wellbeing \u2014 as well as higher productivity, profitability and sales \u2014 than low-engagement teams.\u201d Where the most and least stressed workers are Engagement and well-being results varied in each of the 10 regions covered by Gallup\u2019s poll. The report noted that the United States and Canada, for example, showed the highest percentage of engaged employees (33%) among all the regions studied; and the third highest percentage of thriving employees (53%), behind Australia and New Zealand (60%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (54%). But the US and Canada also ranked second among employees experiencing daily stress (49%), right behind the Middle East and North Africa (52%). By contrast, Europe showed the lowest level of employee engagement (13%). South Asia scored lowest in terms of employees described as thriving overall (13%). And countries in post-Soviet Eurasia ranked lowest in terms of daily stress (19%).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/success/gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

Trump Media & Technology Group\u2019s share price surged more than 30% Monday morning, putting it on track for what would be the biggest single-day gain since the company debuted in late March. During premarket trading, Trump Media shares skyrocketed by 70% at one point before the gains eased during regular trading. The spike is sharply lifting the value of Trump\u2019s dominant stake in the owner of Truth Social. At current prices, Trump\u2019s 114.75 million shares in Trump Media are worth nearly $5 billion. That\u2019s up from $3.5 billion on Friday, the day before Trump was shot at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trading under the ticker symbol \u201cDJT,\u201d Trump Media has achieved a massive valuation despite making little revenue and Truth Social remaining a tiny player in social media. Experts have said Trump Media is a meme stock: trading on momentum and hype, not fundamentals. For months, Trump Media has been a way for investors to bet on Trump returning to the White House, making Truth Social the primary platform for presidential communications. Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management, told CNN on Monday that traders are already speculating that Trump\u2019s chances of winning in November have gone up significantly in the past few days. \u201cYou are seeing the Trump trade on steroids here. DJT is the go-to,\u201d Tuttle said. The rally comes as Trump prepares to formally accept the Republican nomination for president at the convention in Milwaukee this week. Trump Media recently announced it has been added to the Russell 1000 Index of large-cap stocks and the Russell 3000 Index. As a result, countless retail investors now own a piece of Trump Media through mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/investing/trump-media-stock-shooting-truth-social/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_media_ozy-media-carlos-watson-fraud-trial", "text": "Ozy\u00a0Media and founder Carlos Watson were convicted of fraud by a Brooklyn federal jury on Tuesday, in a case accusing them of lying to investors about the now-defunct startup\u2019s finances and sham deals with Google and Oprah Winfrey. Watson, a former cable news anchor and investment banker, and\u00a0Ozy\u00a0were each convicted of securities fraud conspiracy and wire fraud conspiracy, while Watson was also convicted of identity theft. Both had pleaded not guilty. Federal prosecutors said Watson and his California-based news and entertainment company\u00a0falsified information about\u00a0Ozy\u2019s finances and audience size, fabricated contracts and inflated earnings projections to court investors. Founded in 2013,\u00a0Ozy\u00a0imploded in 2021 after news reports questioned its audience numbers and revealed that a top executive had impersonated a YouTube executive during a call with Goldman Sachs\u00a0bankers in which he claimed the streaming site agreed to pay for exclusive rights to an\u00a0Ozy\u00a0show. Prosecutors said Watson could face about 24 to 29 years in prison under recommended federal sentencing guidelines, including a mandatory two years for identity theft.\u00a0His sentencing is set for Nov. 18. \u201cOzy\u00a0Media ultimately collapsed under the weight of Watson\u2019s dishonest schemes and with today\u2019s verdict, Watson himself has been held accountable for his brazen crimes,\u201d Brooklyn US Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement. Lawyers for Watson and\u00a0Ozy\u00a0did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Watson\u2019s lawyer had told jurors that Watson was betrayed by deputies who acted on their own and kept him in the dark about their wrongdoing. The verdict follows\u00a0a six-week trial that featured testimony\u00a0by two former Watson deputies, who pleaded guilty to fraud. They told jurors they conspired with Watson to hide\u00a0Ozy\u2019s crippling debt, meager cash reserves and slow growth. Ozy\u00a0folded shortly after The New York Times reported on former chief operating officer Samir Rao\u2019s impersonation of the YouTube executive. Watson denied involvement in the incident, though prosecutors said contemporaneous chat logs show he coached Rao on what to say. The YouTube executive Alex Piper and Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified for the government, saying they never had deals with\u00a0Ozy\u00a0or considered buying it at any price, contrary to Watson\u2019s claims to investors. Prosecutors said Watson also assured investors that\u00a0Ozy\u00a0was thriving even as its cash reserves sank to $19,000 in 2018\u00a0and\u00a0it struggled to pay rent, wages and other basic expenses. Watson testified for several days in his own defense. He said prosecutors\u2019 view of\u00a0Ozy\u2019s finances was simplistic and failed to appreciate the nuances of media industry dealmaking. He also blamed negative press coverage for\u00a0Ozy\u2019s demise. During cross-examination, Watson was at times evasive about the inconsistent revenue figures\u00a0Ozy\u00a0provided to investors. He also declined a prosecutor\u2019s request to break down\u00a0Ozy\u2019s annual revenue in cash rather than future potential earnings. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way I\u2019ve thought about it before and that\u2019s not the way our investors thought about it,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/media/ozy-media-carlos-watson-fraud-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

Eight years after its publication, Vance\u2019s book has found its way back\u00a0onto the bestseller\u00a0lists, thanks to his appointment as Donald Trump\u2019s running mate. Less than 24 hours after Trump announced Vance was his vice-presidential\u00a0pick, \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d shot to the top of Amazon\u2019s\u00a0bestselling\u00a0books. On Tuesday, the 2020 film adaptation of \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d starring Glenn Close and Amy Adams,\u00a0was the 6th\u00a0most-watched movie on Netflix\u2019s Top 10 in the US, as seen on the streamer\u2019s platform. Viewership of \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d increased by 1,179% on Netflix compared to the day before Vance\u2019s VP bid,\u00a0according to research from Luminate,\u00a0which adds that the film was watched for 19.2 million minutes on Monday, jumping from the 1.5 million minutes the movie was watched on Sunday when rumors were swirling of Vance\u2019s appointment. When the \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d film first debuted, it launched to mostly negative reviews and was largely panned by critics, though Close and Adams received praise for their performances portraying Vance\u2019s grandmother and mother,\u00a0respectively,\u00a0as well as the actor Gabriel Basso, who played a younger version of Vance. Close notably was nominated for \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d at both the Oscars and the\u00a0Razzie Awards, which is the ceremony that infamously honors the worst in cinema every year. \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d chronicles Vance\u2019s childhood in Appalachia, which he wrote was plagued with poverty, abuse and his mother\u2019s addiction. At the time of \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u2019s\u201d release, the book was\u00a0widely discussed\u00a0as an explanation\u00a0for\u00a0Trump\u2019s rise among the White working class. As the book\u2019s popularity went into overdrive after Vance was announced as Trump\u2019s veep pick, Goodreads, a social cataloging website for book recommendations, temporarily restricted actions on \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d including submitting ratings and reviews. A pop-up alert on Goodreads said, \u201cThis may be because we\u2019ve detected unusual behavior that doesn\u2019t follow our review guidelines.\u201d A representative for Goodreads declined to comment to CNN inquiry regarding the specific type of activity on Vance\u2019s book that was detected by the site, but per the company\u2019s\u00a0community guidelines, Goodreads launched the ability to limit reviews and ratings on a book earlier this year.

{"id": "rnc-convention-news-media-coverage", "text": "News organizations are being confronted this week with a thorny challenge. In the wake of former\u00a0President Donald Trump\u00a0narrowly surviving a horrific assassination attempt, executives are more cognizant than ever about the fraught political environment in which they are operating. But news outlets also understand that they must offer audiences clear and direct coverage of theRepublican National Convention. That means not being afraid to call out Trump and the GOP for any promotion of misinformation and/or conspiracy theories. It means not legitimizing and normalizing the radical nature of the party. And it means being blunt about how some of Trump\u2019s avowed plans would upend American democracy and warp the foundational principles embedded within the fabric of the country. Threading that needle will surely prove to be no easy task, especially as Trump\u2019s allies work the refs in the news media and attempt to place any discussion about the threats posed to democracy outside the Overton Window. Already, on Monday, that strategy was on display on opening night at the RNC, with\u00a0Donald Trump Jr.\u00a0berating an\u00a0NBC News\u00a0reporter for having the nerve to ask tough \u2014\u00a0but fair\u00a0\u2014 questions about the\u00a0Republican Party\u2019simmigration proposals. \u201cEven 48 hours later, you couldn\u2019t wait,\u201d Trump Jr. exclaimed, scolding the reporter. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t wait with your lies and with your nonsense. So just get out of here.\u201d Broadcast television outlets will have, perhaps, the most difficult balancing act this week, given the eyes of the nation will quite literally be on their programming. Will they cede their platforms to bad-faith actors? Will they carry the speeches from politicians and others who they know to be lying to their audiences? And if they do air brazen lies to millions, how aggressively will they fact check in the immediate moments afterward? Over the course of this campaign cycle, too many news organizations have inexplicably declined to showcase clear-eyed judgment and recognize that the GOP has been disfigured from its former self, becoming far more extreme in nature over the years. This isn\u2019t the Republican Party of the 1990s. But some news executives seem hellbent on covering the party as if it were. That said, there were promising signs on Monday night, with regard to RNC coverage. Television news outlets, by and large, exercised caution about who they beamed into living rooms and offered viewers important context on the speakers and what they were saying. The coverage was not without flaws, but showed that news organizations were doing their best to meet the difficult moment in the challenging live setting. Given the stakes for the country, hopefully responsible coverage will win the week, instead of the type that turns a blind eye to anti-democratic and extreme behavior.", "source": "http://cnn.com/rnc-convention-news-media-coverage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_business_economy-trump-voters", "text": "In 2018, Jonathan and Trista Schmier felt the economy was so strong that they could take a big risk. They quit their property management jobs and opened a restaurant, Rustic Burger, in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Trista Schmier, who had long dreamed of owning a restaurant, designed the menu, which offered 20 types of burgers. The couple, who are in their 40s and have two sons, had no trouble filling jobs, which paid $9 an hour to start, and food was affordable enough for them to offer a burger, side and 20-oz drink for $9.99. The following year, they opened a second location and were in the process of opening a third when the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020. In 2022, the Schmiers felt the economy was so troubled that they had to shutter the restaurants and go back to property management. It was hard to find reliable workers, and they couldn\u2019t afford to pay $14 an hour to compete with applicants\u2019 other offers. Food prices had skyrocketed \u2014 chicken wings cost $93 a case, up from $40; buns were 87 cents each, up from 33 cents; and Angus beef was $1.66 a patty, up from $1.08. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t keep raising our prices,\u201d said Jonathan Schmier, who received backlash when they began charging $10.99 for the burger, side and drink. \u201cThe customers got very, very upset.\u201d The couple are among the millions of Americans who feel the economy was stronger under former President Donald Trump and want him back in the White House so that prosperity can return. Poll after poll show that voters have more faith in Trump\u2019s ability to handle the economy than President Joe Biden\u2019s. Some 51% of registered voters said they trust Trump more to handle the economy, compared to 32% who trust Biden more, a CNN poll taken in late June found. Likewise, a Pew Research Center poll released in mid-July found that 54% of registered voters are at least somewhat confident in Trump\u2019s ability to make good decisions about the economy, versus 40% who feel that way about Biden. Americans have the same view on the economy now as they did during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic, said Carroll Doherty, Pew\u2019s director of political research. Some 23% of the public said they thought the economy was \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d in April 2020, when most of the nation was under lockdown and millions had lost their jobs, and this past May, when inflation was the top problem. By contrast, some 57% of folks felt that way about the economy in January 2020, which Doherty said was more positive than at any point in the previous two decades. Good economy Trump presided over a strong economy \u2026 at least until the Covid-19 pandemic hit in March 2020, causing the job and stock markets to crater. When Trump entered office in 2017, he inherited and continued what would be the longest employment expansion on record. From Trump\u2019s inauguration in 2017 through February 2020, an average of 181,500 jobs were added on a monthly basis. The unemployment rate hovered around 50-year lows of 3.5% in the months just before the pandemic began, and the rate for Black Americans hit a record low of 5.3% during his administration. (However, that rate went even lower during the Biden administration and hit 4.8% in April 2023.) Before the pandemic, median household income saw the biggest spike in more than four decades \u2014 hitting a record high of $68,700 in 2019, according to the US Census Bureau. The poverty rate fell to 10.5%, the lowest since records started six decades earlier. Trump\u2019s presidency also included the continuation of the longest bull market in history, which began shortly after former President Barack Obama entered office. By many measures, however, the economy under Biden \u2014 who took office while the pandemic was still underway \u2014 has also been strong. The resilience of the US labor market during the past two years has exceeded the early part of Trump\u2019s presidency. Until May, the unemployment rate held under 4% for 27 months, matching a streak last seen in the late 1960s. Meanwhile, the employment rate of women in their prime working years ticked up to a new all-time high of 78.1% in May. But for people \u2014 especially for those who have jobs and were not recently unemployed \u2014 there\u2019s more to the economy than a strong labor market, said Bernard Yaros, lead US economist for Oxford Economics. \u201cThis is where inflation really matters a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat has really colored households\u2019 perceptions about the economy has been inflation.\u201d Prices may not be rising as quickly as they have been \u2014 the latest Consumer Price Index showed annual inflation at 3%, matching the lowest rate of increase seen in three years \u2013 but that might not bring much solace to American households. The overall CPI index is a good 20% higher than it was in February 2020. (In recent history, for a comparable 54-month period, that increase would be around 10%, BLS data shows.) The sharpest rise in prices since the early 1980s also ate away at Americans\u2019 paychecks for many months on end. That was a sharp turnabout from the early years of the Trump administration, when take-home pay was steadily climbing. (Technically, Trump\u2019s four years did see the highest real wage growth since former President Jimmy Carter was in office; however, it was due to the massive loss of 21 million jobs, the majority being in lower-paying industries and lifting average pay data as a result.) \u201cPeople aren\u2019t economists, they don\u2019t think like economists, they don\u2019t look at the rate of change in consumer prices \u2026 they\u2019re looking at how much a dozen eggs cost now compared to two years ago,\u201d Yaros told CNN. \u201cThis is really where I think Biden has gotten dinged by, in terms of his public image of his handling of the economy.\u201d Inflation is expected to weigh on the psychology of the swing voter, Yaros wrote in a research briefing earlier this year modeling out the upcoming election. Yaros and colleagues found that if voters in swing states focus on the cumulative increase in the level of prices since Biden\u2019s inauguration, Trump is expected to win; however, if they focus on the year-over-year change in prices or their inflation-adjusted incomes, Biden is poised to win. Inflation hurts Although Ted Southworth considers his financial situation to be \u201ccomfortable,\u201d inflation has still had a big impact on his and his wife\u2019s lifestyle. Among the changes: They have fewer steak nights at their Burlington, North Carolina, home and eat out less frequently at higher-end restaurants. They are keeping their SUV when the lease expires, instead of getting a new car. Southworth, who retired 15 years ago from his job as director of corporate purchasing at a truck manufacturer, is concerned that prices could continue to rise. \u201cI trust the other guy better,\u201d said Southworth, 74, referring to Trump, whom he voted for in 2016 and 2020. \u201cDuring Trump\u2019s term, there was very little inflation. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got inflation under control yet.\u201d Becky Cantrell, who lives in Land O\u2019 Lakes, Florida, feels the price hikes whenever she goes to the supermarket. Recently, she decided to stop buying mayonnaise because it now costs $7.88, compared to $5 a few years ago. And, she pointed out, Dollar Tree ended $1 prices after 35 years and raised most items at stores to $1.25 in late 2021. Cantrell, whose husband died in November 2020, had trouble finding a job that paid enough to afford the swiftly rising prices, forcing her to work two jobs and take in a friend as a roommate. Finally, in March, she landed a human resources position at a health provider that gives her some \u201cbreathing room.\u201d But she still plans to vote for Trump in November. \u201cEverything was just more affordable before Biden became president,\u201d said Cantrell, 59, the mother of two adult sons.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/business/economy-trump-voters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

Macy\u2019s board of directors voted unanimously to end discussions with Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management over the investors\u2019 offers to acquire the chain. Macy\u2019s said Monday it was unclear that the investors could finance a deal and it was not in shareholders\u2019 best interest. The investors planned to take Macy\u2019s private and consider spinning off its real estate assets or separating its online operations from brick-and-mortar stores. The investors have been trying to buy Macy\u2019s since December. But Macy\u2019s rejected a previous offer to buy the company at $21 a share in January. In March, the investors upped its offer to $24 a share, and Macy\u2019s agreed to enter into talks about the bid. Now, it\u2019s calling off talks. Macy\u2019s will instead stick with its own strategy, led by new CEO Tony Spring, which includes closing underperforming Macy\u2019s stores and investing in its luxury Bloomingdale\u2019s and Bluemercury chains. Investor groups such as private equity funds and hedge funds have been active in recent decades in buying struggling or under-performing retailers, with the stated goal of taking them private, improving their operations and selling them for a profit. But the results have often led to closures, not salvation, for companies such as Sears and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. Macy\u2019s decision to end talks with the investors will benefit the chain, said retail analyst Neil Saunders in a note to clients Monday. \u201cOther than seeking to monetize Macy\u2019s real estate assets for short term gain, neither party brought any long-term value to the table,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of the activist investor proposals would have significantly weakened Macy\u2019s and hampered its ability to survive as a retail operation.\u201d Macy\u2019s stock tumbled around 13% during morning trading Wednesday to $16 a share. Macy\u2019s and other\u00a0traditional department stores\u00a0have struggled, as competition both from online retailers like Amazon and big box retailers, such as Walmart and Target \u2013 which offer shoppers the chance to buy groceries as well as clothes and other household goods \u2013 has left Macy\u2019s with a smaller slice of the retail pie. Analysts also say Macy\u2019s has underinvested, and cost-cutting measures have hurt customer service in stores.

{"id": "2024_07_16_investing_gold-bars-bob-menendez", "text": "On Tuesday, Sen. Bob Menendez was found guilty on 16 counts including bribery, extortion, wire fraud, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent. A key piece of evidence prosecutors presented to jurors during the nearly seven-week-long trial was the gold bars the FBI seized from the senator\u2019s home which he and his wife allegedly received in exchange for acting on behalf of foreign government officials and business people. Menendez maintains his innocence and plans to appeal the verdict, he told reporters outside the Manhattan courtroom on Tuesday. The discovery that Menendez owned a hoard of gold bars stunned many people. Who even owns physical bars of gold these days? Actually, a lot of people. Going for gold Demand for gold\u00a0was already on the rise as people have sought ways to hedge their investments against inflation. Since gold is a tangible asset with a limited supply, it offers that stability. Then, a string of bank failures, beginning with the\u00a0demise of Silicon Valley Bank\u00a0last year, added to the momentum. It was \u201ca wakeup call\u201d to many people, said Jonathan Rose, CEO of Genesis Gold Group, a precious metals firm in Beverly Hills, California. \u201cThere was a feeling of helplessness,\u201d which he said he could attest to since he had money deposited at Western Alliance, which\u00a0came under a significant amount of stress\u00a0in the wake of SVB\u2019s collapse. \u201cA lot of people were fearful thinking, \u2018Maybe my money is not as safe as I thought it was in the banking system.\u2019\u201d As a result, interest in owning gold jumped as people searched for tangible stores of value that \u201ccan\u2019t evaporate,\u201d Rose told CNN. And now even Costco sells gold bars. Ironically, gold hit a record high on Tuesday, the same day Menendez was convicted. That\u2019s because of US investors\u2019 renewed confidence in the prospect of interest rate cuts this year, which also helped the Dow and S&P 500 notch new record highs. The two kilograms and 11 ounces worth of gold bars Menendez and his wife possessed would have been worth over $185,000 as of Tuesday, according to Goldprice.org data. If you can invest in gold, why do people want to physically own it? Even though you can invest in gold and other precious metals without physically owning them, people tend to prefer \u201chaving the currency in their hands,\u201d said Rose. That\u2019s because if, for instance, you invest in a gold ETF, \u201cit\u2019s still tied to the market,\u201d he said. That means if the market were to plunge, you\u2019d be exposed to it and suffer some losses as a result. Where should people keep their gold? Plenty of his clients have buried the gold he\u2019s sold them in the ground, he said. One even stored it in an empty paint can in their garage. Other people who prefer to keep gold under their own roof store it in a gun safe or floor safe, he added. For added assurance, you can take out an insurance policy or keep it in a safe deposit box at a bank, but most of his clients opt not to, he said. However, people who want to invest in IRS-approved physical gold in their tax-deferred investment accounts by law are required to keep it in a bank or with a non-bank trustee.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/investing/gold-bars-bob-menendez/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

The settlement brings to an end a lawsuit filed in November 2023 from three Jewish students over NYU\u2019s alleged failure to enforce its anti-discrimination policies, claiming their civil rights were violated over the university\u2019s handling of\u00a0discrimination and harassment\u00a0against Jewish students. \u201cWe are committed to continuing our vigorous efforts to confront discrimination, including antisemitism, and the settlement in this litigation is yet another step in this direction,\u201d NYU President Linda Mills said in a joint statement with the plaintiffs. The university said it \u201ctakes seriously all allegations of discrimination, confirms that NYU treats all allegations of discrimination against Jews and Israelis in the same manner that it treats conduct prohibited under Title VI and other civil rights statutes when directed at other protected groups.\u201d In the lawsuit, Bella Ingber, Sabrina Maslavi and Saul Tawil, each a junior attending NYU, alleged that NYU created a hostile educational environment that subjected them and other Jewish students to \u201cpervasive acts of hatred, discrimination, harassment, and intimidation\u201d in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

The shutdown of Kaspersky Lab\u2019s US operations will start on July 20, ending nearly two decades of the company operating in the country, according to the company\u2019s statement. \u201cThe company has carefully examined and evaluated the impact of the US legal requirements and made this sad and difficult decision as business opportunities in the country are no longer viable,\u201d Kaspersky Lab said. Independent journalist Kim Zetter first\u00a0reported\u00a0the news of the company\u2019s shutdown. The Commerce Department last month\u00a0announced\u00a0the ban of the sale and provision of Kaspersky software in the United States, citing national security concerns. US officials have claimed that the Russian government could use Kaspersky\u2019s popular anti-virus software to surveil Americans through hacking or data collection. Kaspersky has strenuously denied those claims. More than 400 million people and 240,000 companies worldwide use Kaspersky Lab\u2019s software products, according to the company. Just how many of those people and companies are in the United States is not clear. US government agencies were already banned from using Kaspersky\u00a0Lab software but the Commerce Department\u2019s move to prevent the sale of the software in the United States was unprecedented. The legal authorities cited by the Commerce Department are relatively new and derived in part from a 2021 executive order that President Joe Biden signed in the name of protecting Americans\u2019 personal data from \u201cforeign adversaries\u201d and a related order signed by then-President Donald Trump in 2019. CNN\u00a0reported\u00a0in April that the Commerce Department was taking action against Kaspersky Lab. Founded in Moscow in 1997, Kaspersky Lab grew into one of the world\u2019s most successful anti-virus software companies alongside American rivals like McAfee and Symantec. Kaspersky Lab\u2019s researchers, recognized as top-tier in the cybersecurity industry, are known for analyzing hacking operations suspected of being carried out by a variety of governments including Russia, the United States and Israel, but also cybercriminal threats that affect everyday users.

Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. The United States\u2019 biggest banks are in the hot seat this week. JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo kick off bank earnings on Friday morning. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America report quarterly results next week. The financials sector is expected to see annual earnings growth of 4.3% during the second quarter, according to FactSet. Investors will watch bank earnings closely for clues about how the American consumer and economy are faring in the face of sky-high interest rates and cooling, yet still elevated, inflation. Dave Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar, says that he\u2019s watching for insights on banks\u2019 delinquency rates. Consumers have increasingly fallen behind on or missed payments in recent months as they get squeezed by high interest rates. The share of credit card balances in serious delinquency, defined as payments 90 days or more late, rose to its highest percentage since 2012 during the first quarter, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Corporate earnings and economic data in recent months have signaled that consumers are more judicious about their spending. US retail sales edged higher at an unexpectedly weak pace in May. Target, Home Depot and Best Buy have reported that shoppers are spending less on discretionary items, while discount retailers are benefitting as Americans hunt for deals. The US financial system appears to be in a solid place after last year\u2019s regional banking crisis. All 31 banks evaluated in the Fed\u2019s annual stress test, which assesses the financial resilience of banks under hypothetical fraught conditions, passed this year. But banks could see higher losses compared to 2023 if the economy were to experience a downturn, the Fed warned. Recession isn\u2019t the market consensus. Stocks have surged to repeated record highs in recent weeks as strong corporate earnings expectations, cooling inflation and a resilient labor market build the case for a soft landing, or a scenario in which the Fed brings inflation down without triggering an economic slump. Investors are wagering that the central bank will begin easing rates as soon as September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean banks aren\u2019t preparing for a less ideal scenario. Wall Street will keep an eye on their loan reserve levels. Those reserves contain cash that banks stockpile to protect themselves against potential defaulted loans. Commercial banks and savings institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had roughly $218.6 billion reserved for loan losses during the first quarter of this year, according to FDIC data. That\u2019s up from the $202.1 billion financial institutions set aside during the same period in 2023 and $175.5 billion the year before that. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said at the company\u2019s global China summit in May that while consumers are still resilient, he believes a recession isn\u2019t off the table. \u201cThe worst outcome for all of us is what you call stagflation: higher rates and recession,\u201d Dimon said in an interview with CNBC. \u201cThe world will survive that, but I just think the odds are a little bit higher than other people think.\u201d The US economy faces a new threat The biggest danger facing the American economy for years has been inflation, reports my colleague Matt Egan. Now, another problem is emerging as a credible threat on the horizon: Unemployment. Just as inflation continues to cool, yellow lights are flashing in the still-strong jobs market. The Federal Reserve must now confront the risk that it\u2019s making a mistake by keeping interest rates too high for too long. That\u2019s why some economists are pleading with the Fed to ease up its inflation fight\u2014before high interest rates, which it\u2019s used to tame surging prices, grind the US economy into a recession. \u201cIt\u2019s time to cut rates,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. \u201cInflation is fading as the primary focus of concern. The balance of risks is slowly tipping towards higher unemployment.\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said the labor market is straining under the weight of high borrowing costs. \u201cThe biggest danger is a policy mistake: The Fed keeps rates too high for too long,\u201d Zandi told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cRight now, the Fed is signaling a September cut. I think that\u2019s okay, but if they wait any longer than that, I fear they are going to overdo it.\u201d Even Fed Chair Jerome Powell is acknowledging a significant shift in the risk calculus.

Target will stop accepting this old-school form of payment Target will stop accepting personal checks from customers starting July 15, the latest retailer to stop taking the increasingly rare form of payment and to try to make checkout less cumbersome for shoppers, reports my colleague Erika Tulfo. The company cited \u201cextremely low volumes\u201d of checks in a statement to CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly surprising Target has decided to stop accepting them,\u201d said Neil Saunders, retail analyst at GlobalData. \u201cThat said, there will be small pockets of people, including more elderly consumers, who will lament that they are being phased out.\u201d The company said its stores will continue to accept other payment methods, including Apple Pay, SNAP/EBT, buy now/pay later services, Target Circle Cards, its store card, plus cash, credit and debit cards. Around 61% of Americans are still writing checks, according to a 2024 report by Abrigo, a financial software solutions company. It also found that younger consumers, including Gen Z and Millennials, self reported writing more checks than older consumers from Gen X. Target is not the only store to wave farewell to checks. Grocery store Aldi, for instance, notes on its website that it does not accept checks. Amazon-owned Whole Foods also does not take checks as a form of payment.

{"id": "2024_07_15_media_social-media-assassination-conspiracy-theories", "text": "Saturday\u2019s shooting at a Donald Trump rally was the first assassination attempt of a US presidential candidate in the age of social media \u2013 and\u00a0the former president had barely been hit before the internet was abuzz with all sorts of unsubstantiated explanations for what had, or had not, occurred. The moments of uncertainty created an information void that was quickly filled by speculation, misinformation and conspiracy theories. At the same time, the social media industry has broadly retreated from efforts to clamp down on misinformation. That retrenchment left the door wide open for false and misleading claims by both Trump supporters and opponents. The ease at which false rumors and conspiracy theories rapidly spread on social media threatens the public\u2019s ability to sort truth from fiction. It sometimes influences their behavior and further divides an already fractured America. The deluge of disinformation surrounding the Trump shooting shows, once again, that this problem isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. With less than four months until Election Day, the leading social media platforms appear resigned to let the status quo fester. Conspiracy theories spread wildly Almost immediately after Trump was injured during a shooting at a Butler, Pennsylvania, rally Saturday evening, a conspiracy theory emerged that the assassination attempt had been \u201cstaged\u201d \u2013 that Trump and his campaign had set it up to orchestrate the iconic photos of a resolute Trump surviving an attempt on his life. The term \u201cstaged\u201d began trending on X as soon as an hour after the shooting. The incident was not staged. The US Secret Service has now described it as an assassination attempt and the Department of Homeland Security has acknowledged it as a \u201cfailure\u201d of security. Still, on Monday, the false claim continued to circulate. \u201cI mean it\u2019s a little weird that this is America, and shooters don\u2019t miss unless they are hired to,\u201d a TikTok user with almost 4 million followers said in a video posted over the weekend, before going on to falsely suggest the Secret Service were involved in staging the shooting. By Monday the video had been viewed more than 8 million times, and \u201cliked\u201d more than 1.2 million times. To bolster the \u201cstaged\u201d conspiracy theory, an image began to circulate that had been altered to make it look like one of the Secret Service agents who rushed to Trump\u2019s aid was smiling during the incident. An influential anti-Trump X user who has almost 250,000 followers on the platform shared the image with the message, \u201cEveryone here seems to be having a good time, laughing and smiling for the cameras.\u201d The image was soon debunked by the fact-checking organization Lead Stories, which said it was a digitally manipulated version of an Associated Press image. \u201cThe officers cannot be seen smiling with their teeth as seen in the original, nor in any other news outlets photos of the event,\u201d Lead Stories explained in a blog post. Some prominent Trump supporters, meanwhile, posted their own conspiracy theories. Some suggested, without evidence, that the shooting had occurred because of deliberate negligence on the part of the Secret Service. Others, including elected Republican lawmakers, falsely tried to suggest President Joe Biden or his administration had some role in the attempted assassination. One X user with almost 3 million followers posted a video of the deceased shooter and wrote, \u201cRough day for this CIA officer\u201d \u2013 a baseless insinuation that the intelligence agency had a role in the attempted assassination. Biden has ordered a review of the Secret Service\u2019s\u00a0security protocols in light of the assassination attempt, and the agency has pledged to cooperate with all investigations. Consequences for inaction The reasons people share conspiracy theories are varied. Some do so in a cynical attempt to undermine or attack people who do not share their political point of view. Others get in on the act for social media clout \u2013 viral posts can translate into dollars for some online influencers. Social media companies including Meta, YouTube, TikTok and X didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The enormous temptation to share false claims is being actively rewarded by platforms such as X, formerly Twitter, where owner Elon Musk has made multiple interlocking decisions around account verification, payments to creators, and whom to allow on the platform that have facilitated a noisier and less trustworthy information ecosystem, misinformation researchers have long said. Musk partook in the proliferation of misleading material, sharing a post Sunday that claimed mainstream media outlets were peddling \u201cpure propaganda\u201d about the shooting. As evidence of supposedly biased coverage, Musk cherry-picked some of the earliest press reports about the incident, which referred to \u201cloud noises\u201d and \u201cpopping noises\u201d at the rally. Those were carefully worded initial bulletins that were later updated to reflect that a \u201cshooting\u201d had indeed taken place. But the Trump shooting and its aftermath may be an even bigger indictment of Meta\u2019s decision this year to stop promoting news, politics and social issues in its curated content feeds. At the time, the move was seen as potentially helpful for preventing users from going down algorithmically recommended rabbit holes, but it also triggered predictions that the policy could pose problems during an election year. Saturday\u2019s shooting has vividly illustrated the consequences of that decision, as users expressed frustration that mentions of the incident could not immediately be found on Threads, in direct contrast to X where conspiratorial thinking was flowing freely. The Verge reported Saturday that Meta did appear to be surfacing news reports about the shooting in Facebook search results, and that it inconsistently showed conspiracy-related content at the top of its trending topic on Threads for the incident. Following the publication of this article, The Verge updated its story to reflect that none of the top five posts in Thread\u2019s trending topic for the shooting contained conspiratorial content, which was confirmed to CNN by a Meta spokesperson. Meta\u2019s move to stop amplifying news in user feeds may be the right one for shareholders as executives have come to view moderating that type of content as an unsustainable business cost, said Laura Edelson, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University and the co-director of Cybersecurity for Democracy, a research group focused on digital misinformation. But it may have come at the cost of society writ large. \u201cWhat this leads to is, on Threads, there\u2019s just not very much of either authoritative news or non-authoritative news compared to other platforms because of the nature of the algorithm,\u201d Edelson said. \u201cAnd then people just switch over to other platforms where they can get stuff, and so like on Twitter, there\u2019s a bunch of crazy conspiracy theories getting actively recommended by the Twitter algorithm.\u201d TikTok is also currently a major vector for misinformation about the shooting, Edelson added, because the app\u2019s algorithm promotes content \u201cabout the things that people are asking about, even if they do it in a really irresponsible way.\u201d Meta\u2019s decision to pull back from promoting credible news content in feeds, along with the constant press of unverified and misleading claims on other social media platforms and the comparatively slow drip of confirmed reporting from major news outlets, all appear to have combined to create the perfect conditions for a misinformation maelstrom. The situation calls for more rigorous regulation of social media, Edelson said, but it also offers a lesson for mainstream journalists: Don\u2019t just report what we do know, but also report the outstanding unanswered questions so that the public won\u2019t fill in the gaps with junk information. News outlets \u201cshould be running stories about, \u2018Here are the questions people have, and here\u2019s how we\u2019re trying to find out about them.\u2019 \u2026. Maybe people don\u2019t like to read those stories, but if you don\u2019t write those stories, then what people will do is they will just scroll down one more video to someone who\u2019s going to speculate about how this guy was probably, like, fed information by the FBI.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sean Lyngaas contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/media/social-media-assassination-conspiracy-theories/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_tech_meta-eu-competition-rules", "text": "Facebook parent Meta has been accused of breaking Europe\u2019s new digital competition rules over its \u201cpay or consent\u201d advertising model. Late last year, Meta (META)\u00a0launched\u00a0a service called \u201cSubscription for no ads,\u201d allowing European users of Facebook and Instagram to pay up to \u20ac12.99 ($14) a month for ad-free versions. The alternative is to accept versions with personalized ads. The European Commission said in a statement Monday that, in its preliminary view, \u201cthis binary choice forces users to consent to the (use) of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalized but equivalent version of Meta\u2019s social networks.\u201d If the provisional findings of the Commission\u2019s investigation are confirmed, the EU could hit Meta with a fine equivalent to 10% of its global annual revenue under its landmark Digital Markets Act. Based on the company\u2019s 2023 results, that would amount to $13.5 billion. Meta said it didn\u2019t accept the Commission\u2019s findings. \u201c\u2019Subscription for no ads\u2019 follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.\u201d The EU announcement comes a week after the Commission accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the DMA by preventing app developers from freely directing consumers to cheaper services. The regulators are also investigating Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) under the new law. The DMA, which came into force in March, requires dominant online platforms \u2014 so-called gatekeepers \u2014 to give users more choice, and rivals more opportunities to compete. Online platforms often collect personal data across their own and third-party services and use it in digital advertising services. Margrethe Vestager, a European Commissioner in charge of competition policy, noted in Monday\u2019s statement that Meta had been accumulating personal data of \u201cmillions of EU citizens over many years.\u201d \u201cWe want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalized ads experience,\u201d she said. Michael Koenig, a senior official at the Commission, said Meta must offer users an alternative to \u201cfull\u201d ad personalization that \u201cdoes not rely on this personal data and which is then automatically less personalized and still available to them.\u201d \u201cThen Meta is free to keep a third option, which is a subscription not to see ads at all, or a fourth option which may have some premium features,\u201d he told journalists. The Commission is due to conclude its probe into Meta by late March next year.

{"id": "2024_04_23_cars_electric-vehicle-sales-forecast-iea", "text": "Global electric vehicle sales are set to rise by more than a fifth to reach 17 million this year, powered by drivers in China, according to the International Energy Agency. In a report Tuesday, the IEA projected that \u201csurging demand\u201d for EVs over the next decade was set \u201cto remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport.\u201d It expects half of all cars sold globally to be electric by 2035, up from more than one in five this year, provided charging infrastructure keeps pace. The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs. The agency\u2019s bullish long-term outlook for EVs \u2014 based on current government policies \u2014 comes just days after the world\u2019s biggest battery EV maker Tesla slashed its prices in major markets to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers. Recent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The data \u201cdoes not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars. It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday. The growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers. The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union rose almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. In a statement, Birol said: \u201cRather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.\u201d Despite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats. In the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the world\u2019s biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States. Earlier this month, Tesla posted its first annual drop in sales in nearly four years. The company\u2019s stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year. China\u2019s BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023. Automakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the \u201cpace of the transition to EVs\u2026 will hinge on affordability.\u201d In China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average. \u201cIntensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,\u201d the IEA said. \u201cGrowing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,\u201d it added. Last year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market. \u201cChina is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,\u201d Birol said. Concerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an investigation late last year into China\u2019s state support for EV makers. The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the region\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW. EV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country. By 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA. That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year. \u201cThis shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,\u201d Birol said. The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector. In addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States. Under current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA.

{"id": "2024_07_16_investing_stock-market-dow-trump-trades-nightcap", "text": "Financial markets have a way of responding to chaos that often feels icky. Tragedy strikes and traders (or trading algorithms) sniff out a way to make money off of it. On Jan. 6, 2021, with the Capitol in chaos, the Dow closed at a record high. Stocks also went on a tear as Covid-19 killed millions and gutted economies across the globe. This isn\u2019t because Wall Street is full of psychopaths who want to watch the world burn. (Or at least, it\u2019s not only because of that.) Investors make cold calculations moment to moment with a single focus: How will this affect the bottom line of the companies in my portfolio? So what should we make of the stock market rally on the first trading day after a US presidential contender was shot at? Don\u2019t overthink it. \u201cThe market\u2019s up today, but the market\u2019s up every day,\u201d Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said in an interview Monday. While there were some pockets of the investing world betting on the likelihood of a Trump 2.0 White House, Sosnick notes that equity traders are actually pretty bad at political probabilities. One thing they\u2019re great at is figuring out how geopolitical events effect revenues, earnings and cash flow. \u201cIn this case, it\u2019s not really clear how this would impact the bottom lines of many companies,\u201d he said. \u201cThink of the other stocks that are leading the market higher. You have Apple up 2% \u2014 does that have anything to do with what happened to Trump? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Still, many traders will instinctively believe that the attempt on Trump\u2019s life has the potential to improve his chances of winning in November, at least in part because that\u2019s what happened to Reagan in 1981, Macquarie analysts said in a research note Monday. (Of course, the Reagan comparison doesn\u2019t line up perfectly \u2014 the Gipper was early in his first term, was more seriously wounded, and the political divides of four decades ago were far less fraught \u2014 but we\u2019ll roll with it as a historical point of comparison.) Whether or not the political bump lasts, some traders did seize on the moment to double down on so-called Trump trades. Of course, as the Macquarie analysts note, none of that should suggest political violence is in any way good for markets, which tend to do better when democratic institutions are, you know, not being uprooted at every turn. And while Sosnick said he\u2019s not seeing much of a reaction in the broader equities market to the Trump attack, there is at least one metric signaling some rising expectations for Trump\u2019s reelection, and that\u2019s the Treasury Futures Curve. (Stay with me now, I promise to make this brief.) US Treasury bond yields rose sharply shortly after the June 27 presidential debate \u2014 a disaster for President Joe Biden \u2014 and again on Monday, because bond traders bet that a second Trump presidency seemed more likely.

The funding comes as growth in new electric vehicle sales has slowed, even as the Biden administration wants to keep US EV manufacturers competitive with a surging Chinese industry. Just earlier this year President Joe Biden quadrupled tariffs on electric vehicles from China. \u201cThis announcement is a hallmark of the Biden administration\u2019s industrial strategy, which is a strategy to bring manufacturing jobs back to America after years of offshoring,\u201d Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told reporters.

The move comes as the growth rate of EV sales has slowed even as total EV sales have continued to rise. The industry,\u00a0according to experts, has entered a phase where automakers are struggling to bridge the gap from early adopters to mass market consumers.

In the lawsuit, filed Sunday in New York state court, the president\u2019s sonaccuses Fox News of unjust enrichment, intentionally inflicting emotional distress, and violating New York civil rights laws. The lawsuit makes good on\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s threat he made in April that he would take the network to court if it didn\u2019t immediately issue retractions and corrections. The miniseries, \u201cThe Trial of Hunter Biden,\u201d was a six-part offering on the Fox Nation digital streaming network, and was also promoted on Fox News, the cable TV channel. It featured a dramatized \u201cmock trial\u201d about Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas financial dealings that led in part to his federal tax indictment and that also fueled House Republicans\u2019 struggling impeachment inquiry into his father. Fox News\u00a0took down the miniseries\u00a0in late April, one day after Hunter Biden threatened to file a lawsuit. But according to the lawsuit, promotional materials for the miniseries are still on some Fox News-linked social media pages, and the miniseries episodes are still circulating \u201conline and in the public domain.\u201d A Fox News spokesperson claimed the lawsuit was meritless and \u201centirely politically motivated,\u201d and said the network looks forward to \u201cvindicating our rights in court.\u201d \u201cThe core complaint stems from a 2022 streaming program that Mr. Biden did not complain about until sending a letter in late April 2024,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe program was removed within days of the letter, in an abundance of caution, but Hunter Biden is a public figure who has been the subject of multiple investigations and is now a convicted felon. Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden\u2019s own making.\u201d The new lawsuit claims Fox News \u201ctargeted Mr. (Hunter) Biden in an effort to harass, annoy, alarm, and humiliate him, and tarnish his reputation.\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s son is seeking an unspecified amount of punitive damages, as well as any profits that Fox reaped from the miniseries, and other corrective measures. \u201cThe miniseries is fictionalized; it is not a news event. It was made for the purpose of trade and advertising, and merely exploits Mr. Biden\u2019s name, image, and likeness for Fox\u2019s commercial benefit,\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers wrote in the lawsuit. Hunter Biden\u2019s team said in the lawsuit that without his consent, Fox News \u201cunlawfully published numerous intimate images (both still and video) of Mr. Biden depicting him in the nude, depicting an unclothed or exposed intimate part of him, as well as engaged in sex acts.\u201d The right-wing network said these images originated form Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0infamous laptop\u00a0\u2013 data from which was leaked by allies for former President Donald Trump in 2020. The president\u2019s son was\u00a0convicted at a trial\u00a0last month on federal gun charges, and faces a second trial this fall on alleged tax crimes.

{"id": "2024_07_16_economy_biden-rent-increase-5-percent-cap-plan", "text": "President Joe Biden revealed a series of proposals aimed at lowering housing costs on Tuesday as inflation and elevated home prices are shaping up to be decisive issues for voters this year. The plan, which is subject to congressional approval, calls for withdrawing tax credits from landlords who raise rent by more than 5% per year, beginning this year and for the next two years. The plan would apply only to larger landlords who have more than 50 units in their portfolio, though that counts for more than 20 million rental units across the country, according to the White House. The policy would include an exception for new construction and buildings that are being substantially renovated. That\u2019s aimed at incentivizing new rental property construction to increase supply of apartments and homes for rent. \u201cWhile the prior administration gave special tax breaks to corporate landlords, I\u2019m working to lower housing costs for families,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cRepublicans in Congress should join Democrats to pass my plan to lower housing costs for Americans who need relief now.\u201d While overall inflation is slowing, the cost of housing remains one of the biggest hurdles for many Americans. A record-high 22.4 million renter households spent more than 30% of their income on rent and utilities in 2022, the last time the data was measured, according to a report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. That represents an increase of 2 million households over the previous three years. New inflation data released last week showed that shelter inflation rose in June at the slowest pace in three years. On an annual basis, though, housing price hikes rose 5.2%, outpacing overall inflation. According to recent polling, the issue is of high importance to voters, with 36% of Americans citing economic issues as the most important problems facing the country today, according to a June Gallup poll. Fourteen percent specifically said the high cost of living was the biggest problem in the US. It is unlikely that Congress will pass a bill containing such a proposal this close to a presidential election, though. Some federal lands could be repurposed for housing Biden announced two additional efforts aimed at reining in high housing costs on Tuesday. Several federal agencies said they would assess whether to use surplus federally owned land to build affordable homes at the urging of the Biden administration, according to the White House. For example, the Bureau of Land Management said it would open a public comment period on the sale of 20 acres of public land in Nevada at below-market value to create affordable housing, while the US Postal Service said it plans to repurpose some unused properties for housing. Similarly, the GOP\u2019s policy platform for 2024 also calls for \u201cthe opening of limited portions of federal lands to allow for new home construction.\u201d On Tuesday, Biden, along with the Housing and Urban Development Acting Secretary, Adrianne Todman, also announced $325 million in grant funding to seven cities to \u201cbuild more homes and revitalize neighborhoods.\u201d Those cities include Challanooga, Houston, Miami, Las Vegas, Syracuse, Trenton, New Jersey and Huntsville, Alabama. Rent cap proposal faces pushback from housing groups The Biden administration has addressed home affordability in the past, proposing a \u201cmortgage relief credit\u201d during his State of the Union address earlier this year that would provide $5,000 per year for two years for middle-class, first-time homebuyers. During CNN\u2019s presidential debate in June, Biden hinted at his new plan to address rent increases. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure we cap rents,\u201d he said. \u201cSo corporate greed can\u2019t take over.\u201d Biden also mentioned the plan on Thursday at a NATO Summit press conference. In a statement after the debate, the Housing Solutions Coalition, an alliance of major housing organizations, including the Mortgage Bankers Association, said that Biden\u2019s plan for rent caps would hurt renters rather than help them, though. \u201cDecades of academic research\u00a0from across the United States and around the world clearly show that rent caps \u2014 more commonly known as rent control \u2014 reduce the supply of available housing and fail to target those renters who need help the most while simultaneously harming other residents and the communities they reside in,\u201d the statement said. \u201cRent caps hurt renters and communities.\u201d However, a senior administration official said that the plan to cap rents is only intended to serve as a two-year bridge until rental units enter the market, bringing down rents. There are currently 1.6 million units under construction in the US as of May, according to Federal Reserve data.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/economy/biden-rent-increase-5-percent-cap-plan/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_success_buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage", "text": "Moving somewhere new when you retire isn\u2019t uncommon. But deciding whether to take out a new mortgage to buy a home is a big deal. Much of your financial life is changing as you transition from a steady paycheck to a mix of fixed and variable income and a new lifestyle. So adding a large debt to the picture isn\u2019t an easy call. That\u2019s especially true now that mortgage rates hover around 7% and home prices keep rising. \u201cAny time you take on debt, you increase risk in your situation,\u201d said Illinois-based certified financial planner Jim Stork. More than a third (35%) of homebuyers last year were between the ages of 59 and 98, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Within that group, a majority financed their purchases. Whether taking out a new mortgage makes sense for you depends on a lot of factors, including how to prove to a lender that you\u2019re a good credit risk, plus your feelings about the debt and the ongoing cost of maintaining a home. To get a mortgage, your age won\u2019t be a factor, but your income will be If you\u2019re concerned that you may be less attractive to a mortgage banker because you\u2019ve hit retirement age, know that it is illegal to discriminate against anyone applying for a mortgage based on their age. Lenders\u2019 chief focus will be on your ability to repay your mortgage with your various sources of non-paycheck income. \u201cWhen you qualify for a mortgage, it\u2019s all based on your income,\u201d said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage. That, and of course any debt you have that will soak up your income, but we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. The income sources that lenders consider, absent a regular paycheck, include: Social Security benefits, pension or annuity income, spousal benefits, disability payments, interest and dividends and your 401(k) or IRA. If a portion of your income is not subject to tax, the lender may treat it as worth 25% more. Fannie Mae offers this example: Say 15% of a $1,500 monthly Social Security benefit is tax free. That means $225 of it will not be subject to tax ($1,500 x 15%). And 25% of that amount comes to $56 ($225 x 25%). So that $56 can be added to a person\u2019s qualifying Social Security income amount ($1,500 + $56 = $1,556). If you want to use your nest egg, different methods can be used to calculate how much income it would provide. There is the asset depletion method in which your eligible assets are divided by your loan term. In the case of a 30-year mortgage, that would be 360 months. If your IRA is worth $700,000, that translates into $1,944 per month ($700,000/360). \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to take the money out \u2014 but you can use your assets [to qualify for a mortgage] as if you were going to take the distribution,\u201d Cohn said. Another option: If you are at least 59-1/2, you can start taking monthly distributions from an IRA without penalty \u2014 or a 401(k) if your plan rules permit \u2014 and the lender will count that as income so long as you show that you have sufficient funds in the account to keep taking that same monthly distribution for three years. Once you close on your home, Cohn said, you can reduce or stop taking distributions if you choose. That assumes you are not yet in your 70s when the IRS requires you to start taking minimum distributions, said Mark Luscombe, a principal analyst at Wolters, Kluwer Tax & Accounting. Burdened by debt? Lenders will also assess your debt-to-income ratio, because no matter how much income you have, the big question is how much of it will be consumed by your debts. The debt portion is composed of your expected mortgage payment plus any credit card, student loan, car loan or other outstanding debt you may have. Generally speaking, for conventional loans your DTI ratio can be up to 50%, Cohen said. That ratio falls to between 43% and 45% if you\u2019re taking out a jumbo loan, she added. A jumbo loan exceeds the conforming loan limits in the area you want to buy. But ideally your debt level will fall well below these top limits, both for the lender\u2019s sake and yours. And, of course, the higher your credit score, the better the interest rate you can get on a mortgage. What you should consider before taking out a mortgage Even before seeking a mortgage, get a good grasp on your expected monthly income and expenses in retirement. Compared to pre-retirement earnings, \u201cMost (new retirees) see a decrease in income,\u201d said certified financial planner Lori Trawinski, director of finance and employment at AARP. While some expenses may also decline \u2014 e.g., work-related costs like commuting \u2014 others may increase over time, Trawinski said, like medical costs, property taxes, home insurance and utilities. Of course, you can downsize and move to a lower-cost area. But if you stay near where you lived during your career, your expenses are likely to rise over time. Also, Trawinski noted, if you\u2019re married, consider what will happen to your household income when one spouse dies. This will help you assess your future comfort level in carrying a mortgage. \u201cPeople often fail to plan for the death of a spouse. You can take a big hit to your income when that happens,\u201d she said. If you do move to a new state or region, weigh renting first. You can get a better sense of the cost of living in the area and decide whether it\u2019s a good fit for you. As Stork put it, \u201cFlorida in August is not as fun as Florida in January.\u201d How much are you really willing to take on? All the usual financial decisions that go into homebuying apply no matter your age. But, in retirement especially, you don\u2019t want to take on more debt than necessary, since the cost of a mortgage is fixed, but the returns on your investments, the housing market and your health needs are variable. At the very least, Stork said, consider whether you can put enough money down \u2014 at least 20% \u2014 to avoid having to pay private mortgage insurance. Beyond that, consider whether you feel comfortable keeping up \u2014 and paying for \u2014 maintenance on a home. Maintenance might amount to 2% a year of your home\u2019s value, Stork said. That amounts to $10,000 a year on a $500,000 home. Maintenance is essential in preserving the value of your house should you ever decide to sell. How would your mortgage interest rate compare to a reasonable rate of return on your investments? The decision to get a mortgage was a lot easier for retirees when rates were historically low \u2014 roughly 3% \u2014 and their nest eggs were earning a lot more. \u201cBut at today\u2019s rates it\u2019s a much harder calculation,\u201d Stork said. This is especially the case if you\u2019re a very conservative investor. \u201cIf your CDs are earning 4% and a mortgage would cost you 7%, you will lose money every day on that decision,\u201d Stork explained. To get the truest reading on what makes financial sense, compare mortgage expenses to your investment returns on an after-tax basis, Stork noted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/success/buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

Joe Scarborough, speaking alongside co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Willie Geist, said that the show\u2019s staff had been told on Sunday evening that all of MSNBC\u2019s lineup would be pre-empted for a single NBC News feed in the wake of the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. But, as he noted, \u201cthat did not happen.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t know why that was that didn\u2019t happen.

CNN\u00a0first reported\u00a0Sunday evening that Cesar Conde, the NBCUniversal News Group chairman, had made the decision to pull the top-rated morning program Monday, in conjunction with Rashida Jones, the MSNBC president, and Scarborough and Brzezinski. In the wake of the attempt on Trump\u2019s life, some of the former president\u2019s supporters have vehemently criticized the press and liberal media commentators for their hard-knuckled reporting, which has sounded the alarm on what four more years under the former president would look like. MSNBC has, in particular, been blasted by Trump\u2019s allies, putting the network in the spotlight. Some of Trump\u2019s allies have gone as far as to attack the network\u2019s parent company, Comcast. The decision to pull \u201cMorning Joe\u201d was made with that political reality in mind. A person familiar with the matter told CNN on Sunday they moved to preempt the celebrated roundtable program over concerns a guest might make an inappropriate comment that could be used to assail the program and network as a whole.

{"id": "2024_07_16_economy_retail-sales-june", "text": "Wall Street is cheering after fresh data showed American consumers aren\u2019t tapping out quite yet, despite a disappointing few months for retailers. US retail spending has been mostly flat since the beginning of the year, holding steady in June, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. Consumer spending is American\u2019s main economic engine, powering two-thirds of the US economy. Retail sales, which capture spending on goods and food services, make up a big chunk of overall spending. June\u2019s reading was better than the outright decline economists projected in a FactSet poll \u2014 a shift from prior months when retail sales consistently came in worse than expected. The figures are adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation. US consumers\u2019 surprising show of resilience helped send stocks higher on Tuesday, with the Dow reaching a new record. Sales at gas stations declined the most last month, dropping 3% from May. Spending at car dealerships and on automotive parts also fell markedly in June, reflecting the cyberattack on CDK Global, a software provider for dealerships. Excluding spending at gas stations and on cars, sales were up a solid 0.8% in June. Meanwhile, online sales were up a healthy 1.9% in June. The strength from that category could persist in July due to Amazon\u2019s annual deal event known as Prime Day. Sales at home improvement stores were also robust last month, rising 1.4%. The Federal Reserve and Wall Street investors are paying close attention to the health of the US consumer. Unemployment has crept up in recent months as evidence mounts that the American shopper is spending more cautiously nowadays. The economic landscape has proven challenging for some consumers in a few ways. Inflation has resumed a downward trend, but it\u2019s still elevated; interest rates have been perched at a 23-year high for about a year now; savings accumulated during the pandemic have been exhausted by now, according to some measures; and job opportunities aren\u2019t as ubiquitous as they were a few years ago. Retailers have said in recent months that a growing number of shoppers are now opting for cheaper alternatives. As earnings season kicks off, big-box stores are set to share some key details on Americans\u2019 spending behavior. There is plenty of evidence by now that the US economy is slowing, but it likely won\u2019t fall off a cliff this year. Fed officials and most economists aren\u2019t expecting a recession this year, but it\u2019s unclear whether unemployment will hold steady or continue to climb after it rose to a 4.1% rate in June, the highest since November 2021. \u201cConsumers have become increasingly cautious with their spending as they feel the pinch from higher prices and borrowing costs, but the latest report shows no signs of consumer retrenchment,\u201d said Lydia Boussour, a senior economist at EY-Parthenon, in a note Tuesday. Companies continue to sound the alarm on the US consumer Helen of Troy, the company behind notable brands such as Vicks, Braun and Revlon, last week reported weak quarterly earnings, sending shares of the company plummeting by more than 25%. \u201cConsumers are even more financially stretched and are even further prioritizing essentials over discretionary items,\u201d Noel Geoffroy, the company\u2019s chief executive, said on an earnings call, adding that \u201ctraffic overall is slower throughout the country and promotional pressure is increasing.\u201d PepsiCo\u2019s latest earnings results, out last week, also disappointed investors in some key areas. The company\u2019s snack unit Frito-Lay posted a dip in revenue after hiking prices for multiple quarters. The strain US consumers are feeling has resulted in \u201ctighter household financial conditions,\u201d the company said, so \u201cperformance across many food categories, including snacks, has been subdued and consumers have become more value-conscious.\u201d Conagra Brands, which includes Slim Jim beef jerky and Vlasic pickles, last week reported weaker sales in its latest quarter and said it expects lower profits in the fiscal year ahead. Chief executive Sean Connolly said that consumer demand has been disappointing but expects it to improve as \u201cas consumers adapt and establish new reference prices.\u201d What it means for the Fed Tuesday\u2019s report doesn\u2019t change much for the central bank as it mulls the timing of the first interest rate cut. The Fed seems to be on track to cutting interest rates at some point in the next few months, thanks to inflation moderating again after getting stuck early this year. The latest Consumer Price Index, released last week, showed that monthly prices declined in June. On an annual basis, prices were up 3%, down from May\u2019s 3.3% rate. The latest inflation readings, coupled with signs of a slowing economy as reflected in the latest spending figures, help build a case for Fed officials to begin paring back interest rates. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cheered the latest inflation figures Monday, saying during a moderated discussion in Washington: \u201cWe\u2019ve had three better readings, and if you average them, that\u2019s a pretty good pace.\u201d He added that recent economic data \u201cadd some confidence\u201d that inflation is getting under control. Wall Street traders are currently betting that the Fed will roll out its first rate cut at the September 17-18 meeting, but there are still several crucial pieces of economic data due before central bank officials next meet to discuss monetary policy.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/economy/retail-sales-june/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_business_demolition-ranch-shirt-trump-shooter", "text": "Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20-year-old who\u00a0opened fire on former President Donald Trump\u00a0during a campaign rally Saturday\u00a0in Pennsylvania, was pictured twice wearing a t-shirt that said \u201cDemolition Ranch\u201d on it. A law enforcement official told CNN that one of the times was when Crooks was at an ammo store and the other was during the assassination attempt. Demolition Ranch is a popular YouTube channel for gun enthusiasts with more than 11 million subscribers. Its founder, Texas-based Matt Carriker, distanced the brand from the shooter in an almost six-minute-long video posted Monday on the channel. \u201cWe were shocked and confused to find this out: The shooter who tried to assassinate Trump was wearing merch from my channel, wearing a Demolition Ranch t-shirt. And that sucked to see that. Yeah, that was rough,\u201d he said. The video racked up more than 520,000 views within two hours of publishing. Demolition Ranch usually posts a variety of videos relating to guns with titles such as \u201cEating A Meal Cooked ONLY With A GUN!!!\u201d and \u201cHow Lethal is The TINIEST Gun I Own???\u201d \u201cNo matter what side you\u2019re on politically, none of us want violence. This channel was never meant to incite violence or hate,\u201d Carriker said in the video. The shirts are printed in Carriker\u2019s hometown and sold and shipped all over the world, he said in the video. Carriker said Demolition Ranch cannot vet everyone who buys its products. T-shirts are sold online for about $30, and the online store also sells hoodies, hats, stickers and other accessories. \u201cTo see my name next to the shooter\u2019s name sucks. And I wish, I wish we could keep that from happening,\u201d Carriker said. Crooks\u2019 attack killed one and critically injured two others. Crooks had been perched on a nearby building rooftop outside the rally\u2019s security perimeter, and was shot and killed by Secret Service agents, according to law enforcement officials. On Friday before the attack, he went to a shooting range where he was a member, and practiced firing, a law enforcement official told CNN. The next morning, Crooks went to a hardware store, where he bought a five-foot ladder, and also went to a gun store, where he purchased 50 rounds of ammunition, the official said. He lived in the Pittsburgh suburb of Bethel Park and graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022, according to a local media\u00a0report\u00a0and a video of the school\u2019s graduation ceremony.

{"id": "2024_07_11_business_citigroup-jane-fraser-wall-street", "text": "Three years ago, as the long-struggling Citigroup was in a tailspin over a billion-dollar fat-finger error, the bank announced its next CEO, Jane Fraser. At the time, given Citi\u2019s chronic problems, it might have looked like a classic Glass Cliff hire \u2014 the well-worn corporate strategy of putting a woman in charge just as the business is foundering. Fraser, the first woman ever to run a Wall Street bank, inherited a behemoth that had become a\u00a0laughingstock\u00a0among its peers, hobbled by its unwieldy bureaucracy, a bloated staff and slim profit margins. The fat-finger error \u2014 in which a Citi employee accidentally wired hundreds of millions more than they should have to creditors of Revlon \u2014 was the epitome of the kind of control problems that regulators had been warning the bank about for years. But lately, to the surprise of Citi\u2019s critics, things are looking up. Since September, when Fraser laid out her vision for a more streamlined Citigroup, the bank\u2019s stock has shot up more than 50%. For the first time in nearly two decades, Wall Street appears to be feeling something almost like optimism about America\u2019s third-largest bank. Its stock has outperformed rivals JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America so far this year, and it is expected to report 5% earnings growth for the second quarter this Friday. The bank\u2019s finances are greatly improved, but even the most bullish Citi analysts say Fraser has a long way to go to get the bank\u2019s financial house in order. \u201cThe year 2024 is Jane\u00a0Fraser\u2019s\u00a0midterm exam,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Mike Mayo, senior banking analyst at Wells Fargo. If the subject is architecture, she gets an A-plus for her plan. But, he said,\u00a0\u201cshe gets a grade of B to C for the execution, and she gets a grade of D for the financial results.\u201d Mayo has a long and rocky history with Citi,\u00a0a bank that\u00a0he has relentlessly criticized for its management missteps and aggressive accounting practices. But speaking of Fraser\u2019s tenure, Mayo sounded unusually sanguine about her progress in simplifying Citi\u2019s notoriously labyrinthine corporate structure. He even expects the stock price to double in the next three years. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same arrogant Citigroup of the past half-century,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThey finished a watershed org simplification in seven months \u2026 and this involved 200,000 employees.\u201d On an earnings call this spring, Fraser herself touted the reorg as \u201cthe most consequential set of changes\u201d to Citi\u2019s internal structure, which has already made the bank nimbler and more transparent. Still, Mayo said the bank offers the \u201cworst-in-class efficiency, returns and stock market valuation.\u201d \u201cI think she will pull it off. But I\u2019m also cognizant that as good of an architect as she is, it\u2019s yet to be determined if she can build it,\u201d Mayo said. Of course, Fraser, who took over in March 2021, is still being haunted by the sins of Citi\u2019s past. On Wednesday, the bank was hit with a\u00a0$136 million fine\u00a0from federal regulators, who said the bank has made \u201cinsufficient progress\u201d in fixing problems with data management and risk controls.

{"id": "2024_06_12_success_saving-under-high-interest-rates", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is an updated version of an article that originally ran on May 1. As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged for its seventh meeting in a row on Wednesday. People carrying variable-rate debt like credit cards and those seeking a loan won\u2019t be happy given that the Fed\u2019s rate, which directly and indirectly affects consumers\u2019 borrowing costs, remains at a 23-year high. Those rates will likely stay high for a while. At this point, only one cut is seen as likely before the end of the year, according to US central bankers\u2019 latest summary of economic projections. But whenever the cuts start, they may be small. \u201cAbsent a complete about-face from the economy, interest rates aren\u2019t likely to come down soon enough, or fast enough, to provide meaningful relief to borrowers. Utilize zero-percent credit card balance transfer offers, shop around for lower fixed-rate personal loans and home equity loans, and channel as much income as possible toward paying down this debt as quickly as possible,\u201d said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com\u2019s chief financial analyst. But the Fed\u2019s decision leaves savers, once again, in the catbird seat when it comes to making money on their money. \u201cSavers are enjoying the best returns on savings accounts and CDs in more than 15 years, with the most competitive offers outpacing inflation. In addition, these conditions are poised to persist for the foreseeable future,\u201d McBride said. Online high-yield savings accounts The best bang for your savings can still be had in online high-yield savings accounts at FDIC-insured banks, which yield way more than today\u2019s 0.58% overall average savings rate. As of June 11, the average online savings account rate was 4.40%, according to DepositAccounts.com. And many online high-yield accounts continue to offer rates of 5% or more. Say you have $10,000 in savings. If you leave it parked in a regular savings account at 0.5%, you\u2019ll get $50 in interest for a year. If you put it instead in a 5% high-yield account, you\u2019ll get $500. A high-yield savings account is the best place to park money you\u2019ll need to cover emergencies as well as anticipated large expenses that you have to pay in the next three months to a year. As with any savings account, banks can lower the rate they offer \u2014 also known as the APY \u2014 at any time. And you can be sure they will do just that when the Fed looks like it will finally start cutting rates, McBride said. But, he added, since rates are likely to be cut in small increments, online high-yield savings accounts may continue to offer inflation-beating returns for some time. \u201cThey will still offer the best way to preserve your [money\u2019s] buying power,\u201d McBride said. Money market accounts and money market funds Money market deposit accounts and money market mutual funds are generating yields competitive with the best high-yield savings accounts. But there are important differences. Money market deposit accounts are bank products. So, assuming your bank is FDIC insured, your account is too. (Or, if your account is at a federally backed credit union, your money will be\u00a0insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.) As with high-yield accounts, you may get the best deals at an online bank. But money market accounts may have a higher minimum deposit requirement than a high-yield account. Money market funds, by contrast, are an investment product \u2014 they generate return by investing in short-term, low-risk debt instruments and are currently yielding an average of 5.12%, according to the Crane 100 Money Fund Index. Such funds are a good place to park cash you have in your brokerage account that you may want to use at some point to buy equities or bonds, McBride said. Money market funds are not FDIC-insured, but any brokerage you use should be insured by the\u00a0Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which\u00a0covers your funds up to a limit if your brokerage ever goes under. Certificates of deposit CDs are still a great place to park any money you can leave untouched for a fixed\u00a0period of time \u2014 anywhere from a few months to five years or longer. As of June 11, the average rate was 4.971% on an online one-year CD, and 3.815% on a five-year CD, according to DepositAccounts.com. While your brick-and-mortar bank may offer a CD at a good rate, you may get a better one shopping around. The easiest way to do that without having to set up an additional account at another bank is to shop for CDs through your online brokerage, which is likely to offer a wide array of CDs from many different banks. At Schwab.com, for instance, CDs on offer ranging in duration from three months all the way up to 10 years offered average annual returns over 5%, with most ranging between 5.30% and 5.45%. The highest annual average was 5.56% for a three-month CD. If you have to withdraw money before the end of a CD\u2019s term, you can always get all of your principal back but may forfeit some of the interest earned as an early withdrawal penalty. Treasury bills and notes Beyond deposit accounts, investing in short-term Treasury bills and intermediate-term Treasury notes has been another way to earn a competitive return with virtually no risk since Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Treasury bills come in six different maturities: 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 13 weeks, 17 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks. Treasury notes mature in two, three, five, seven or 10 years. \u201cAs long as the Fed holds its rate in the 5.25% to 5.5% range, we expect most Treasury bill yields to hover around 5.25% as well,\u201d said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. But, Martin added, \u201cWhile the timing of rate cuts has been pushed back, we still expect them to arrive later this year, and investors in short-term investments would likely face reinvestment risk.\u201d That\u2019s why he suggests investors consider buying some intermediate-term investments now before rates are cut if they want to lock in a higher yield for some of their money, such as Treasury notes maturing in the next four to 10 years. On Wednesday, yields on Treasury bills were north of 5% and yields on Treasury notes were north of 4%, according to Schwab.com. When deciding whether it makes sense to invest in a CD or a Treasury for the same duration, you might opt for the Treasury if you live in a high-tax state, McBride suggested, since interest on Treasuries is\u00a0exempt from state and local taxes. In all instances, the easiest way to purchase Treasuries and other bonds is to do so through your brokerage account.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/success/saving-under-high-interest-rates/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_media_masha-gessen-russia-sentencing-ukraine-intl", "text": "Russian-American journalist Masha Gessen was sentenced to eight years in prison by a Moscow court Monday for criticizing the Russian military, becoming the latest target of a crackdown on critics of the Kremlin. Gessen was convicted in absentia on charges of disseminating \u201cfalse information\u201d about the Russian armed forces, according to the Moscow court statement. The Russian-born journalist and writer is an opinion columnist for\u00a0The New York Times and\u00a0the author of numerous books about Russia, including the award\u2013winning\u00a0\u201cThe Future Is History: How Totalitarianism Reclaimed Russia.\u201d Gessen, who lives in the United States, has been heavily critical of Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine and, over many years, has condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s crackdown on human and LGBTQ+ rights. In a letter posted to\u00a0Facebook\u00a0Monday, Gessen called the charges \u201cillegal and unfounded.\u201d Gessen, who uses \u201cthey/them\u201d pronouns, said that \u201cas far as I understand from the indictment,\u201d the charge is related to an interview they conducted with anti-war Russian blogger Yuri Dud, which was published on YouTube. \u201cIn the interview, I discuss the actions of the Russian Armed Forces in the spring of 2022 in Bucha, Irpin, and other settlements in Ukraine. My statements are based on data collected during my journalistic work,\u201d Gessen said, highlighting a series of interviews they conducted in Bucha, Irpin, Kyiv, and Kryvyi Rih in 2022, as well as their previous journalistic work in Chechnya. \u201cBased on this work, I believe that Russian military personnel committed a number of war crimes in Bucha, Irpin, and other settlements of Ukraine, namely: murder of civilians, illegal detentions, torture, and looting.\u201d \u201cMany years of experience in other conflict zones allow me to say that these actions are not exceptional but, on the contrary, quite typical for Russian military personnel,\u201d Gessen added. \u201cThis is exactly what was discussed in the interview with Yuri Dud.\u201d The YouTube interview has been viewed more than\u00a06.6 million times\u00a0since its release in September 2022. The International Criminal Court (ICC), as well as a number of Western states and international institutions, have accused Russia of war crimes during its ongoing war in Ukraine. In March, the ICC charged two high-ranking Russian officials with directing attacks at civilians, causing excessive harm to civilians, and the crime against humanity of inhumane acts. While the Russian military has conducted its invasion, the Kremlin has sought to stifle criticism of its strategy at home. A number of prominent anti-war figures have been sentenced and convicted since February 2022, under vague new laws that punish what the Kremlin deems to be fake news about its military. \u201cCriminal prosecution is an attempt to punish me for the conscientious and consistent fulfillment of my professional duties,\u201d Gessen said. \u201cI am outside the Russian Federation, so the so-called court can \u2018consider\u2019 my case, \u2018arrest,\u2019 and \u2018sentence\u2019 me only in absentia. However, I regard the criminal prosecution and putting me on the wanted list as an attempt to intimidate me and prevent me from carrying out my professional activities.\u201d The trial of American journalist\u00a0Evan Gershkovich is meanwhile set to resume Thursday, having been brought forward at the request of the defense, Russia\u2019s Sverdlovsk regional court has said. Gershkovich is the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in\u00a0Russia\u00a0since the Cold War. His trial began last month, with the journalist appearing in the courtroom\u2019s glass cage, his head recently shaved. He was arrested while on a reporting trip for the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) in the city of Yekaterinburg in March 2023 and later accused of spying for the CIA. Gershkovich, the US government, and the WSJ have vehemently denied the charges against him. Within two weeks of his arrest, the US State Department designated him as wrongfully detained and called for his immediate release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/media/masha-gessen-russia-sentencing-ukraine-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_04_24_tech_nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc", "text": "Texting on the Moon? Streaming on Mars? It may not be as far away as you think. That\u2019s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets. A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year \u2014 the exact date has yet to be confirmed \u2014 carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon\u2019s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth. \u201cThe first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,\u201d Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation. The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia\u2019s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice. One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice. Images of ice \u2014 transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network \u2014 would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon. For NASA\u2019s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable. Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund \u2014 especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated. \u201cBeing able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis \u2014 as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,\u201d said Engelund. \u201cEventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.\u201d It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth\u2019s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing \ufeffspace colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth. NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy. Bell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the \u201cframework for the lunar economy.\u201d \u201cA future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,\u201d Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN. \u201cThis includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.\u201d There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too. If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth \u2014 such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms. \u201cEspecially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,\u201d Klein said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/tech/nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

NBC announced on Wednesday it will use AI software to recreate Michaels\u2019 voice to deliver daily recaps of the Summer Games for subscribers of its Peacock streaming platform, a milestone for the use of AI by a major media company. The use of an AI voice for the Olympics comes as the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, sound and text.

{"id": "2024_06_17_success_how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges", "text": "Long before you take your high schooler on college campus tours, consider this: Shopping for college shouldn\u2019t be any different than shopping for a home.\u00a0When you want to buy a home, you come up with a range of how much you can afford and get pre-qualified for a mortgage. Then you look in neighborhoods that offer homes that meet your family\u2019s needs and fall within your price range. \u201cAdopt a mindset that we\u2019re buying college like we\u2019re buying a house,\u201d said Beth Walker, author of \u201cBuying College Better\u201d and \u201cNever Pay Retail for College.\u201d As a financial adviser and certified\u00a0college planning specialist, Walker tries to help families avoid a situation that many find themselves in at the 11th hour: Their child applies \u2014 and gets into \u2014 schools they cannot afford because the schools won\u2019t give them enough aid. And then they just \u2026 try to make it work, no matter how much debt is involved for the parents or the student. Instead, she advises families to start as early as 9th or 10th grade in figuring out what is affordable for them as a family \u2014 so parents don\u2019t sacrifice their own financial welfare and the future college student doesn\u2019t drown in debt upon graduation. And second, she recommends assessing how a child\u2019s talents and interests pare with majors and careers they might want to pursue. Doing both those things can help you target the right colleges to apply to. Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners, defines the perfect college as one \u201cwhere a student can go be happy, safe and successful, graduate in four years or less with a marketable degree and little or no debt.\u201d In helping families align parents\u2019 affordability constraints with their student\u2019s academic and social needs, he cautions them not to automatically assume the Ivys or other high-prestige schools will be best simply because of their status. And he stresses what success in life looks like after college and notes that an Ivy League degree isn\u2019t the only path to achieving it, especially if your child won\u2019t get much aid to attend. In fact, said Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, a lot of brand-name schools don\u2019t even offer merit-based aid, only need-based. So if you\u2019re not rich, but you make too much to qualify for need-based aid, you could find yourself having to cover the entire cost of tuition, room and board every year, which is pushing $90,000 at some US colleges. Set up financial guardrails well before the college search Fothergill created a free calculator called CostHero that lets parents assess what financial resources they will have available to pay for a child\u2019s college education. It then provides a range of affordability: At the low end is the number representing what they can pay if they don\u2019t take on debt. And at the high end is the number they can pay if they also take out an unsubsidized federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). \u201cIf you\u2019re not in a position to write a check for $90,000 a year, put up guardrails for yourself so you don\u2019t blow up your retirement,\u201d he said. The calculator inputs let you set the amount of resources you\u2019re willing to use to pay for college from your income and savings, your child\u2019s earnings from summer jobs, any family gifts, and any federal Stafford loans your child may take. It also factors in if you qualify for the federal American Opportunity Tax Credit. That credit, for qualified educational expenses, will reduce your tax bill or increase any refund you have coming. The calculator also gives you a debt-to-income score like the kind a mortgage lender might use to assess whether you\u2019re a good credit risk. Ideally, he said, you don\u2019t want your housing costs to exceed 36% of your gross income and your total debt \u2014 including debt from housing, cars, credit cards and any parental education loans \u2014 to exceed 43%. If your DTI ratio is close to or higher than 43% that is a sign you could get yourself into trouble if you end up having any financial problems while your child is in college, Fothergill said. \u201cIf folks have a way to determine the range of affordability prior to the onset of the college search, the outcomes are a lot better.\u00a0 For example, if one knows that the range of affordability is between $30,000 [a year] with no parent debt and $50,000 with parent debt, then any college that comes in with a net cost in that range is, by definition, affordable,\u201d Fothergill said. Net cost refers to the true cost of attendance after figuring out how much aid your child may get (e.g., grants and scholarships). Figure out where your student may qualify for the most aid Generally speaking, the biggest tuition discounts go to the most academically accomplished students in an incoming class. \u201cThe student needs to be in the top 25% of those admitted,\u201d Walker said. Getting into that top 25% cohort is based on SAT or ACT scores, and having a high, unweighted GPA based on a rigorous high school curriculum. The curriculum\u2019s academic rigor can be further bolstered by taking AP courses. Since your child is more likely to make the top quartile at some schools than others, Fothergill and Walker both recommend your child focus on applying only to those schools in which they stand the best chances of being in that top group to maximize their chances for merit-based aid. Otherwise, you\u2018ll spend money to apply to guidance-counselor-recommended \u201csafety\u201d schools or \u201creach\u201d schools with no sense if those places are affordable to you should your child get in. Using reported data from admissions officers about their key criteria in admitting an incoming class and based on what more than 1,000 schools report about the qualifications they used to grant aid, Fothergill created another tool called ListHero. It gives students a score that helps gauge\u00a0how competitive their profile is\u00a0at a given school, relative to others admitted, and by extension their eligibility for tuition discounts. Right now the tool is only available to college planning professionals for a fee. But Fothergill plans to create a free mini-version for consumers to use. For parents doing their own research on test scores, GPA requirements, costs and aid, he recommends checking the Department of Education College Scorecard, the site CollegeData.com and the College Board. Other ways to reduce college costs before applying While your children are in high school they can take other steps to reduce the total cost of their education. One way is by doing well on the PSAT to qualify to compete for a National Merit Scholarship. Another is to take AP courses. If their high school doesn\u2019t offer them, there is a program called Freshman Year for Free offered by the Modern States Education Alliance. It provides free AP placement courses and pays the fee for students to take the AP tests or college-level preparation (CLEP) tests administered through the College Board. Getting the minimum AP scores a college requires to earn a college credit will lower how much you ultimately have to spend on tuition. A third option is to see if your state has a program that offers a year of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to a state university from which your child could earn their degree. Or, if you plan to go to any other college, make sure the school will accept the credits from a community college course you plan to take. No matter what steps you take, starting the research and budgeting process early can save everyone a lot of stress, debt and potential heartache in the end. Said Walker: \u201cWe have to be a lot more intentional about this purchase.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/success/how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything.

According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}

The Dow rose climbed 211 points, or 0.5%, closing at a fresh record high. That comes after the blue-chip index hit a fresh all-time high on Friday and edged back above 40,000 following encouraging inflation data. The S&P 500 gained 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.4%. Bettors raised their wagers that Trump will win the November election against President Joe Biden: A contract betting that Trump will win went for 68 cents on Monday, implying a 67% chance of the former president winning the election, according to election prediction market platform PredictIt. That\u2019s up from 60 cents on Friday. The price of a contract for Biden\u2019s victory cost 26 cents on Monday. The US dollar rose 0.1% on Monday as of 4 pm ET. The price of bitcoin climbed 4%.

Trump on Monday named US Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate. A Trump win in November likely means the\u00a0preservation or expansion of tax cuts\u00a0and increased tariffs. During last month\u2019s presidential debate hosted by CNN, the former president reiterated his desire to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, which would likely increase inflation and cast doubt on interest rate cuts. Morgan Stanley research estimates that an expansion of the 2017 tax cuts would boost deficits sharply. While economic growth sounds positive for the US, some investors worry that it could reaccelerate inflation. The Federal Reserve has hiked interest rates to a painful 23-year high to tame wayward inflation, driving up borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to student loans to auto payments. While the central bank has signaled one rate cut for 2024, rates have yet to budge, as policymakers look for more signs that inflation is cooling. Economic expansion runs the risk of derailing the central bank\u2019s hard-fought progress. \u201cA second\u00a0Trump\u00a0presidency would mean expansionary economic stimulus in general, lower income taxes, less regulation, and increased tariffs,\u201d wrote Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert Financial, in a Monday note. \u201cWith painful inflation still high but possibly on its way out, the economy is in a tender state in which too much growth too fast could lead to the re-igniting of 2022-like price growth spikes.\u201d As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might change slightly.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/markets/us-markets-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_economy_weo-imf-interest-rates-inflation", "text": "The International Monetary Fund has warned that stubborn inflation could keep interest rates higher for longer than expected, increasing fiscal and financial risks around the world. Persistently high prices for services \u2014 which include haircuts, hotels and restaurants \u2014 as well as escalating trade tensions are propping up inflation and raising the prospect that interest rates will stay high for a while yet, the IMF cautioned Tuesday in its latest World Economic Outlook. The warning highlights that the global economy is not yet in the clear when it comes to inflation, which explains the caution on the part of central banks in cutting interest rates. High borrowing costs, in turn, are prolonging the squeeze on household and business finances. Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said central bank officials in the United States needed \u201cgreater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably\u201d toward their 2% target before going ahead with the first interest rate cut. The Bank of England, meanwhile, held off on cutting rates last month even though UK inflation slowed to the central bank\u2019s 2% target in May. However, services inflation came in higher than expected. The Bank of England emphasized that \u201cmonetary policy needs to be restrictive for an extended period of time until the risk of inflation becoming embedded above the 2% target dissipates.\u201d In its report Tuesday, the IMF said it still expected major central banks to reduce borrowing costs in the second half of the year. It anticipates one cut by the Fed before the end of the year, chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told journalists. The IMF thinks global inflation will slow to 5.9% this year, from 6.7% last year, in line with its forecast in April. The agency blamed sticky services price inflation \u2014 partly driven by higher wages \u2014 for \u201cholding up progress\u201d on reducing overall inflation. \u201cEnergy and food price inflation are now almost back to pre-pandemic levels in many countries, while overall inflation is not,\u201d Gourinchas said. \u201cRising services prices and wages may keep overall inflation higher than desired,\u201d posing a \u201csignificant risk\u201d to economic growth, he added. Tariffs will hurt living standards The IMF also noted that rising trade tensions \u201ccould further raise near-term risks to inflation by increasing the cost of imported goods.\u201d The US and the European Union have in recent months hiked tariffs on electric cars made in China, driven by concerns that local jobs and strategic industries could be wiped out by cheap Chinese imports. The US has also increased tariffs on a raft of other products from the world\u2019s no. 2 economy, including steel, batteries, semiconductors and critical minerals. Gourinchas said the \u201csurge in unilateral measures,\u201d including tariffs, was a \u201ckey concern\u201d for the IMF. \u201cIf anything, it will distort trade and resource allocation, spur retaliation, weaken growth, diminish living standards and make it harder to coordinate policies that address global challenges, such as the climate transition,\u201d he added. The IMF sees the global economy expanding 3.2% this year, as it forecast in April. But the agency downgraded its forecast for US growth to 2.6% \u2014 0.1 percentage point lower than projected in April. The economy encompassing the 20 countries that use the euro is seen expanding by a \u201cmodest\u201d 0.9%, 0.1 percentage point higher than predicted in April. The IMF also made upward revisions to its 2024 growth forecasts for India and China, which it now expects to expand by 7% and 5% respectively \u2014 up from forecasts of 6.8% and 4.6% in April. The projected growth in the two countries would account for half of global expansion. \u201cAsia\u2019s emerging market economies remain the main engine for the global economy,\u201d Gourinchas said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/economy/weo-imf-interest-rates-inflation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_tech_google-wiz-acquisition", "text": "Google owner Alphabet is in advanced discussions to buy fast-growing cybersecurity startup Wiz for roughly $23 billion, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN. A takeover of Wiz, which makes cybersecurity software for cloud computing, would represent a major bet by Google on cybersecurity, marking the tech giant\u2019s biggest-ever acquisition. Discussions between Google and Wiz began after the startup raised $1 billion from venture capital investors earlier this year, the source said. Terms of a potential deal have not been finalized and talks could still collapse, according to the source. News of the Google-Wiz talks was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Neither Google nor Wiz returned CNN\u2019s requests for comment. The deal would easily surpass Google\u2019s purchase of Motorola for $12.5 billion about a decade ago, the biggest takeover in company history. Google offloaded Motorola just two years later for a massive loss. A $23 billion price tag on Wiz is nearly double the $12 billion valuation of the startup from its most recent round of funding. In March 2022, Alphabet bought cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion as part of its efforts to help companies better address cyber threats and bolster its cloud computing business. Google Cloud is central to the company\u2019s efforts to diversity revenue beyond its core search advertising business. Although its cloud sales have grown, it has struggled to compete with similar services from Microsoft\u00a0and Amazon. Buying Wiz would be a \u201cshot across the bow\u201d at Microsoft and Amazon, showing that Google is making a \u201cmajor bet on the cyber security space to complement its flagship offering in the cloud,\u201d Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at\u00a0Wedbush, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Cloud security has become especially important in recent years as companies have spent heavily to move data to cloud platforms. Just last week, AT&T revealed that nearly all of its wireless customers\u2019 call and text records were exposed in a massive breach caused by an \u201cillegal download\u201d on a third-party cloud platform. The Google-Wiz deal talks come despite intense antitrust scrutiny under the Biden administration of tech giants. However, that antitrust scrutiny could be dialed back somewhat if Trump once again takes hold of the White House, Ives said, making the Federal Trade Commission \u201cmuch weaker\u201d and sparking an \u201caccelerated merger and acquisition environment to take place for Big Tech.\u201d If the acquisition gets finalized and closes, it would mark a massive exit for Wiz and its founders \u2014 Assaf Rappaport, Ami Luttwak, Yinon Costica and Roy Reznik. The four executives met years ago when they were drafted into Unit 8200, the cyber intelligence division of the Israel Defense Forces. Since starting up in March 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, New York City-based Wiz has enjoyed explosive growth. Today, the company says 40% of Fortune 100 companies are its clients. Notable customers include BMW, Slack and Salesforce, and it works with major cloud companies including Amazon, Microsoft and Google.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/tech/google-wiz-acquisition/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/17/2024", "section": "business"}}
