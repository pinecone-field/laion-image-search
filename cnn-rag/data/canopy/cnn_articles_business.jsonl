{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

Berkshire revealed it acquired nearly 26 million shares of Chubb in a Wednesday Securities and Exchange Commission filing of the company\u2019s first quarter investments. That translates to a value of approximately $6.7 billion. Buffett\u2019s company had shielded the position from public knowledge as it was building the stake, requesting \u201cconfidential treatment\u201d from the SEC in previous filings. Chubb, an insurance business that operates in 54 countries, made headlines in March after the company underwrote President Donald Trump\u2019s nearly $92 million appeal bond in E. Jean Carroll\u2019s defamation lawsuit. Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s CEO famous for his investing prowess, has amassed a sizable following of investors who mimic his portfolio moves. Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Chubb is no exception. Chubb\u2019s stock jumped by more than 8% in after-hours trading on Wednesday. Buffett\u2019s bet on Chubb is familiar territory: insurance companies Geico, National Indemnity and General Re are all subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway. The investment in Chubb underscores Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s investment strategy over the past several months. It has seemingly doubled down on financial companies like Ally Financial, American Express and Bank of America while trimming its investments in consumer products. In February, Berkshire disclosed that it sold off 10 million shares of Apple in the first three months of the year, though Apple remains Berkshire\u2019s largest investment.

{"id": "2024_05_17_business_american-airlines-flight-attendants-wages", "text": "America\u2019s cost of living crisis has stung new flight attendants, many of whom haven\u2019t had an opportunity to renegotiate their contracts since the inflation spiral began several years ago. An employment verification letter American Airlines gives to some newly hired flight attendants documenting their salary has been circulating on Reddit, drawing attention to their low wages. The letter states that a new American Airlines flight attendant will have a \u201cprojected annual salary [of] $27,315 per year before incentives and taxes\u201d and concludes, \u201cAny courtesy you can provide would be appreciated.\u201d The union representing American Airlines workers, the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), verified the authenticity of the letter, which is given to potential landlords or for other services where attendants need to verify their employment and income. The union represents 28,000 American Airlines flight attendants, and it is working on their first new contract in five years \u2013 a deal that stretches back before the pandemic and the inflation crisis. American Airlines did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Even as price increases are slowing down, the letter shows how, for some Americans, a little inflation relief isn\u2019t nearly enough. The low wages for starting flight attendants \u2013 a job once seen as glitzy \u2013 underscores how many people are still struggling, despite what on paper looks like a strong economy and job market. This salary is above the federal poverty line of $15,060 for a single-person household. But that\u2019s a national level and doesn\u2019t take into account regional price differences, including in major metro areas where the cost of living can be significantly higher. In some states, such as Massachusetts, new flight attendants would qualify for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, commonly referred to as food stamps. For a single-person household, Massachusetts residents earning less than $30,120 a year are eligible for SNAP benefits. The union says that flight attendants\u2019 low salaries compared to top airline executives is a prime example of \u201ccorporate greed.\u201d New flight attendants at American Airlines start at $27,000 per year. Robert\u00a0Isom, the CEO of American Airlines,\u00a0earned $31.4 million last year \u2014 1,162 times\u00a0more than a new attendant. \u201cWe have flight attendants who are sleeping in their cars,\u201d APFA communications director Paul Hartshorn told CNN. American Airlines flight attendants have not gotten a raise since 2019, and the union is escalating its push for a new contract to raise wages. Flight attendants for United Airlines, Alaska Airlines and other carriers are also pushing for new contracts to raise wages. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the mean annual wage for flight attendants in 2023 was $71,000. While being a flight attendant is a full-time job, many flight attendants only get about 75 hours of hourly pay a month. For many flight attendants, hourly pay basically begins when the plane\u2019s door closes. They do not get paid for the hours they need to be at the airport or on the plane during boarding and deplaning. APFA is proposing a 33% pay increase to top out at $91 an hour during the first year of a new contract and increases of 5%, 4% and 4% for the remaining years of a four-year agreement. The union is also calling for full retroactive pay raises based on how much attendants flew during five years of negotiations. Under federal law, flight attendants cannot go on strike without permission from the government. The law,\u00a0which is known as the Railway Labor Act, requires union members at airlines, among other certain industries, to remain on the job until after federal mediators declare an impasse in talks. But the union is calling on President Joe Biden and congressional leaders to urge the National Mediation Board to allow the union to pursue a potential strike. The National Mediation Board is a federal agency that oversees labor-management relations in the US railroad and airline industries. \u201cAmerican Airlines is not going to come to the table with an economic proposal that meets our needs unless they have the threat of a strike,\u201d Hartshorn said. \u201cManagement needs the threat of a strike to move in the direction we need them to.\u201d Flight attendants at Southwest Airlines last month ratified a new contract that includes pay raises totaling more than 33% over four years. \u201cWe expect to be compensated along the lines of Southwest,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/business/american-airlines-flight-attendants-wages/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_markets_dow-closes-above-40-000", "text": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 40,000 mark Friday for the first time in its 139-year history. The blue-chip index initially crossed the key threshold early Thursday but ended that day lower. Wall Street has been boosted in recent days by renewed hopes of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve that would loosen monetary conditions for consumers and businesses. A report this week from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that inflation has started to ease, potentially paving the way for the central bank to start implementing the rate cut that investors have been expecting since the start of the year. \u201c40,000\u00a0is a great milestone, but end of the day there isn\u2019t much difference between 39,999 and 40k,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, in a note Friday. \u201cStill, this is a great reminder of how far we\u2019ve come. Think about how many people were talking about recessions and bear markets all of last year. Now we are once again back to new highs.\u201d \u201cInvestors who were patient and ignored all the scary headlines were once again rewarded, just as they have been throughout history,\u201d he wrote. All major indexes closed the week higher, but markets were mixed on Friday. The Dow rose 134 points, or 0.3%, to close at a record high of 40,003.59. This is the Dow\u2019s fifth consecutive winning week. The S&P 500 gained 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.1% lower. Crossing 40,000 Crossing the 40,000 level\u00a0doesn\u2019t hold much practical value for investors,\u00a0but it does catch the attention of the public and, some argue, it could help propel that optimistic sentiment beyond Wall Street. \u201cThe Dow 40,000 milestone also shows how resilient the US economy has been, at a time where there was a plethora of calls for a recession,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial, in a recent note to CNN. \u201cThe overarching importance of crossing these big round numbers is that it brings Wall Street news to Main Street, at least for a day. It also serves as an affirmation that corporate earnings are growing, and that investor confidence remains robust,\u201d he said. To many Americans, \u201cthe Dow\u201d simply means the stock market. The index\u2019s small cache of stocks \u2014 ranging from Microsoft to McDonald\u2019s to Chevron \u2014 represents some of the largest companies in the nation and are widely held among retail and institutional investors alike. A look back Here are some important stops along the Dow\u2019s road to 40,000: Dow is formed:\u00a0The first daily close, on May 26, 1896, was 40.94. The Dow did not get off to a good start, plunging 30% to an all-time low of 28.48 by August that year. Dow 100:\u00a0The Dow first closed in triple digits in January 1906. That marked an impressive rally for the average, which had hit an all-time low when Teddy Roosevelt was president. The Federal Reserve would not be created for seven more years. Crash of 1929:\u00a0The Dow fell 38 points on Oct. 28 and 31 more points the next day. That might not sound bad today, but it represented back-to-back declines of 13% and 12% of the Dow\u2019s value. They are still two of the worst one-day percentage declines in the index\u2019s history. Dow 1,000:\u00a0Nov. 14, 1972. Richard Nixon had just won reelection by taking 49 states. The Dow\u2019s components, which had been unchanged for 13 years, included Woolworth, Eastman Kodak and International Nickel. Crash of 1987:\u00a0On Oct. 19, the Dow plunged 508 points, a 23% drop that is still the largest one-day percentage decline in history. A week later it took an 8% plunge. But the damage was short-lived: Within a year, the Dow was back to pre-crash levels. Dow 10,000:\u00a0March 29, 1999. The \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d of the tech bubble was in full swing as the Dow gained 1,000 points in less than a year to hit this benchmark. It gained 1,000 more points in just the next month. A year later, the dot-com stock bubble burst, sending the Dow down nearly 30% by September 2001. Meltdown of 2008-2009:\u00a0The financial crisis caused the Dow to lose about half its value in less than a year, bottoming out to close at 6,547 on March 9, 2009. The worst day was Sept. 29, 2008, when the Dow lost what was then a record 778 points after Congress rejected a $700 billion bank bailout. The bailout was later approved. Dow 15,000:\u00a0May 7, 2013. As the economy continued to recover from the Great Recession, the Dow had one of the current bull market\u2019s strongest periods. It crossed the 15,000 mark and finished the year up 26.5%, marking the best full-year performance of the current bull market. The Dow nearly matched that in 2017, rising 25%. Dow 20,000:\u00a0January 25, 2017. The stock market had enjoyed a nice run starting on the day after the 2016 election, with the Dow gaining nearly 10% as investors looked forward to lower taxes and less regulation under the Trump administration. Dow 25,000:\u00a0Jan. 4, 2018. The passage of the Trump tax cuts, especially the lowering of the corporate tax rate in December 2017, helped feed the quick move between 20,000 and 25,000. Dow 30,000:\u00a0Nov. 24, 2020: Covid sent the stock market plunging in the spring of 2020. But new hopes of a vaccine and the results of the presidential election ended an era of uncertainty on Wall Street, sending the stock market rolling once again.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/markets/dow-closes-above-40-000/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

But you know it\u2019s up, and up is better than down. \u201cMention \u2018the Dow\u2019 and, to most people, that means the stock market,\u201d said market strategist Art Hogan. \u201cThe Dow Jones industrial average is an instant way of telling the world which way the market is moving, even if the average isn\u2019t an accurate measure of the thousands of stocks listed on the nation\u2019s exchanges.\u201d While most professional investors look at the S&P 500 \u2014 a much broader measure of what\u2019s happening on Wall Street \u2014 everyday Americans look to the Dow. The number of Google searches for \u201cDow Jones\u201d is always higher than the searches for \u201cS&P 500,\u201d\u00a0said Nick Colas, co-founder of market research firm DataTrek. \u201cIf you\u2019re not an investor, you know that a rising stock market means the economy is decent, and you probably have less of a chance of being laid off,\u201d Colas said. There\u2019s nothing magical about the Dow. It\u2019s just an index that tracks the stock market activity of 30 large US companies, from Amazon to McDonald\u2019s to the Walt Disney Company. But it is very old, and that\u2019s partly why it sticks around. \u201cThe Dow is, no doubt, an anachronistic index,\u201d says Daniel Alpert, managing partner of\u00a0Westwood Capital. \u201cIts primary benefit is that it goes back forever.\u201d Deep roots If you wanted to peek at what stocks were doing in the days leading up to the October 1929 crash, the Dow is the only index that has that information preserved in amber. You can trace the Dow back to the 1890s, whereas the S&P 500 wasn\u2019t created until 1957, well after the economic upheaval of World War II. The Dow serves as a running history of the US economy, like those charts that show the evolution of humans from Neanderthal to homo sapien. You can track the rise and fall of heavy industry and the emergence of Silicon Valley through changes in the Dow\u2019s composition, which was once dominated by the likes of Standard Oil and US Steel. These days, UnitedHealth, Microsoft and Goldman Sachs are the Dow heavyweights. Weird weighting Serious traders sometimes look down their nose at the Dow because of the way it ranks companies by share price, rather than by market capitalization, like the S&P 500 does. Market capitalization measures the total value of a company on the stock market. In the Dow, a smaller company with less relevance to the economy can outweigh a bigger company. In its current iteration, for example, the Dow deems Goldman Sachs \u2014 a Wall Street bank with almost no consumer-facing business, valued at about $125 billion \u2014 more important than Apple, a nearly $3 trillion tech behemoth with a billion customers. The way the points work: You take the price of one share of each of the 30 companies, add those up and divide by the \u201cDow divisor,\u201d a constant figure that helps account for fluctuations in the market. Explaining the weird logic of the Dow, Colas told me: \u201cIf somebody asks you how your kids are, what you do is you add up their ages. I\u2019ve got a 10, 5 and 3 year old \u2014 I\u2019m an 18 \u2026 A higher number doesn\u2019t really tell you anything, but it\u2019s like, OK, my kids are getting older.\u201d Despite its flaws, the Dow is a strong brand that\u2019s been embedded in the American psyche. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly imperfect index,\u201d Alpert says. \u201cBut it\u2019s the word that, in the shortest possible number of letters, describes Wall Street.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/business/dow-40000-history-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

The companies are the latest additions to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act Entity List that restricts the import of goods tied to what the US government has characterized as an ongoing genocide of minorities in China\u2019s Xinjiang region. US officials believe Chinese authorities have established labor camps for Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in China\u2019s western Xinjiang region. Beijing denies any abuses. Many of the cotton companies listed are based outside of Xinjiang but source their cotton from the region, the US Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. The designations help \u201cresponsible companies conduct due diligence so that, together, we can keep the products of forced labor out of our country,\u201d Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary of Homeland Security, said in the statement. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington criticized the move. \u201cThe so-called \u2018Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act\u2019 is just an instrument of a few US politicians to disrupt stability in Xinjiang and contain China\u2019s development,\u201d the spokesperson said. Washington has restricted imports from 65 entities since the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act Entity List law was passed in 2021, according to the department. \u201cWe enthusiastically endorse DHS\u2019s action today to nearly double the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act\u2019s \u2018Entity List\u2019 \u2014 while recognizing that the current list remains only a fraction of the businesses complicit in forced labor,\u201d Representative Chris Smith and Senator Jeff Merkley, chairs of the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China, said in a statement.

A retirement savings crisis may be looming in the United States but it doesn\u2019t appear to be forcing people to consider working full-time into their old age. By the end of the decade, about 21% of the population will be 65 or older, up from 15% in 2016, according to forecasts by the Census Bureau. Most non-retired adults have some type of retirement savings, but only 36% think their savings are on track. New research from economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York finds that this retirement savings deficit hasn\u2019t made a dent in when Americans plan to exit, or partially exit, the workforce. In fact, researchers found that since the pandemic, workers have reported much lower expectations of working full-time beyond ages 62 and 67 (the latter is the retirement age for full Social Security benefits). Surprisingly, they found that the decline is particularly notable for lower-income and female workers. What\u2019s happening: The pandemic ushered in the great resignation. Almost 50 million people quit their job in the two years following the worst of Covid-19, citing pressures such as burnout, general job dissatisfaction or child care or elder care needs. Amid a tight labor market, many were also able to find a better job, with better pay. The trend was so prevalent that Beyonc\u00e9 even released a song about it. But even though the pandemic is over, and the US economy has recovered quickly from the 2020 recession, the labor force is still experiencing unprecedented changes, report New York Fed economists Felix Aidala, Gizem Kosar and Wilbert van der Klaauw. Looking at the Survey of Consumer Expectations\u2019 (SCE) triannual Labor Market Survey, the economists found that beginning in March 2020, retirement-age full-time employment expectations began to plunge and have persistently declined since. The survey hit an all-time low in March 2024, when just 45.8% of respondents said that they planned to work full-time beyond the age of 62. Those expectations averaged 54.6% in the six years before the pandemic. \u201cThe decline is broad-based across age, education, and income groups, with workers under age 45, without a college degree, and with annual household incomes below $60,000 showing slightly larger declines than their peers,\u201d wrote the researchers. What it means: While the great resignation has ended and wage growth is easing, the New York Fed\u2019s survey responses still \u201creveal a persistent decline in expectations of working full-time beyond ages 62 and 67,\u201d said the economists. They\u2019re not sure what\u2019s behind the phenomenon and they said they were surprised by the results given increases in life expectancy. There could be a litany of explanations, many due to post-pandemic cultural shifts about the value of work and an increase in savings during the pandemic. Either way, it could be significant for the economy. \u201cThe pandemic-induced change in retirement expectations may continue to affect the labor market in years to come,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt also can have important macroeconomic implications when consumers act on their expectations in making consumption and saving decisions.\u201d It could also have serious implications for the timing of claims for Social Security benefits. Social Security payments still provide\u00a0about 90% of income\u00a0for 12% of older men and 15% of older women, according to Social Security Agency surveys. But without intervention, the Social Security trust fund\u00a0will be depleted\u00a0by the mid-2030s, meaning that only a portion of retirees\u2019 expected benefits will be paid out. Lawmakers have faced a decades-long political stalemate on how to fix it. Yes, but: This is a survey of expectations, researchers at the New York Fed are quick to point out. Just because Americans say they plan to shift to part-time work or retire early, it doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ll be able to. Debt \u2014 and delinquencies \u2014 are on the rise for Americans The\u00a0economy has been resilient, the\u00a0job market healthy\u00a0and\u00a0consumers keep spending, but more Americans are becoming financially overextended \u2014 especially on their credit cards, reports my colleague Alicia Wallace. New data released Tuesday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed that as household debt balances grew during the first quarter, delinquencies also marched higher. Notably, the percentage of credit card balances in serious delinquency (90 days or more late) climbed to its highest level since 2012. \u201cIn the first quarter of 2024, credit card and auto loan transition rates into serious delinquency continued to rise across all age groups,\u201d Joelle Scally, regional economic principal within the Household and Public Policy Research Division at the New York Fed, said in a statement. \u201cAn increasing number of borrowers missed credit card payments, revealing worsening financial distress among some households.\u201d Aggregate delinquency rates increased during the first quarter to 3.2% of outstanding debt in some stage of delinquency, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2020, according to the New York Fed\u2019s latest Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit. The transitions into delinquency \u2014 especially serious delinquency \u2014 increased across all debt types, according to the report. Walmart is cutting hundreds of corporate jobs Walmart said Tuesday it is eliminating several hundred corporate jobs and will relocate most of its remaining remote office staff to its Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters, reports CNN\u2019s Parija Kavilanz. Walmart confirmed the move in a memo sent by Donna Morris, its chief people officer, to employees on Tuesday and obtained by CNN. Morris, in the memo, said the decision to relocate employees and ask other remote staff to come back into the office was made to facilitate better collaboration, innovation \u201cand move even faster.\u201d \u201cWe also believe it helps strengthen our culture as well as grow and develop our associates,\u201d she said in the memo. The relocation will impact the majority of workers in Walmart\u2019s Dallas, Atlanta and Toronto offices. While most relocations will be to its Bentonville headquarters, some workers will be relocated to Walmart offices in the San Francisco Bay Area or to Hoboken, New Jersey, and the New York area. \u201cIn addition, some parts of our business have made changes that will result in a reduction of several hundred campus roles,\u201d Morris said in the memo. \u201cWhile the overall numbers are small in percentage, we are focused on supporting each of our associates affected by these changes.\u201d Walmart\u00a0is expected to report its latest quarterly earnings on Thursday. The latest round of layoffs at the world\u2019s largest retailer comes close on the heels of Walmart\u2019s announcement\u00a0last month\u00a0that it was exiting its virtual healthcare services and was shuttering all 51 of its healthcare centers in six states.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

A spokesperson for London-based Arup told CNN on Friday that it notified Hong Kong police in January about the fraud incident, and confirmed that fake voices and images were used. \u201cUnfortunately, we can\u2019t go into details at this stage as the incident is still the subject of an ongoing investigation. However, we can confirm that fake voices and images were used,\u201d the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \u201cOur financial stability and business operations were not affected and none of our internal systems were compromised,\u201d the person added. Hong Kong police said in February that during the elaborate scam the employee, a finance worker, was duped into attending a video call with people he believed were the chief financial officer and other members of staff, but all of whom turned out to be deepfake re-creations. The authorities did not name the company or parties involved at the time. According to police, the worker had initially suspected he had received a phishing email from the company\u2019s UK office, as it specified the need for a secret transaction to be carried out. However, the worker put aside his doubts after the video call because other people in attendance had looked and sounded just like colleagues he recognized. He subsequently agreed to send a total of 200 million Hong Kong dollars \u2014 about $25.6 million. The amount was sent across 15 transactions, Hong Kong public broadcaster RTHK reported, citing police. \u201cDeepfake\u201d normally refers to fake videos that have been created using artificial intelligence (AI) and look extremely realistic. Earlier this year, pornographic AI-generated images of pop star\u00a0Taylor Swift\u00a0spread across social media, underscoring the damaging potential posed by AI technology. Attacks \u2018rising sharply\u2019 As a top engineering consulting firm, Arup has 18,500 employees across 34 offices around the world. It was responsible for landmarks such as the Bird\u2019s Nest stadium, site of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. \u201cLike many other businesses around the globe, our operations are subject to regular attacks, including invoice fraud, phishing scams, WhatsApp voice spoofing, and deepfakes. What we have seen is that the number and sophistication of these attacks has been rising sharply in recent months,\u201d Rob Greig, Arup\u2019s global chief information officer, said in the emailed statement. Authorities around the world are growing increasingly concerned about the sophistication of deepfake technology and the nefarious uses it can be put to. In an internal memo seen by CNN, Arup\u2019s East Asia regional chairman, Michael Kwok, said the \u201cfrequency and sophistication of these attacks are rapidly increasing globally, and we all have a duty to stay informed and alert about how to spot different techniques used by scammers.\u201d Kwok returned to the role earlier this month, replacing Andy Lee, who announced his departure from Arup on his LinkedIn page about a week ago after 26 years at the company.

{"id": "2024_05_17_investing_boeing-shareholders-vote-to-approve-usd33-million-ceo-pay-package", "text": "Shareholders of embattled airplane maker Boeing approved a pay package of nearly $33 million for outgoing CEO Dave Calhoun at the company\u2019s annual general meeting on Friday. That\u2019s the highest package ever paid to the company\u2019s CEO and a 45% increase from the $22.6 million he received for 2022. The vast majority of the bump comes from a giant stock bonus granted on top of his more-than-a-million-dollar salary. Calhoun, who has led Boeing since 2020, announced in March that\u00a0he will leave the company by the end of the year. The shareholder vote on Friday was made to approve Calhoun\u2019s 2023 pay package. Calhoun has said he declined to accept an additional annual incentive bonus of $2,800,000 for the year \u2013 a request the board said he made after the Alaska Airlines incident. Upon his retirement, Calhoun is set to take home another going-away present: a $45 million mix of stock awards and options that vest over time. The approval comes as the plane maker is facing additional scrutiny for a series of safety incidents,\u00a0including a mid-air blowout of part of a fuselage in January, which prompted a number of investigations into the company\u2019s practices, an executive shakeup and promises that the company will turn itself around. Boeing has been struggling financially for five years, since fatal crashes of its 737 Max in late 2018 and early 2019 resulted in a 20-month grounding of its best-selling plane. It was also hit by the pandemic, which caused a near-halt in air travel for months and deep losses at most airlines that buy its planes. \u201cOur compensation program is designed to align leadership pay with the long term performance of our business,\u201d said Steve Mollenkopf, Boeing\u2019s new chairman, when asked how the company can justify such a high compensation package given recent safety grievances. \u201cIt\u2019s really driven by meeting our commitments to the highest safety and quality standards.\u201d Since the start of the grounding in 2019 the company has reported adjusted losses totaling more than $31 billion, and losses are projected to continue going forward. \u201cThe board is confident that the current compensation structure continues to directly align with performance and balances both the meaningful progress made to restore operational and financial strength along with the fact that certain performance criteria has not been met,\u201d he said. The compensation committee \u201ctook swift action to make significant design changes to our compensation plan in 2024\u201d after the Alaska Airlines incident in January, Mollenkopf said. The annual incentive metric now gives greater weight to operational metrics, like safety and quality. Shares of Boeing (BA) were down 0.1% in afternoon trading.

{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity?

{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

The British bank said in a report Wednesday that it expects nearly 1.2 million Swifties to attend the superstar\u2019s shows in the UK this summer, with the typical fan expected to spend \u00a3642 ($810) on travel, accommodation and other expenses \u2014 injecting a total of \u00a3755 million ($953 million) into the economy. It is just the latest example of \u201cSwiftonomics\u201d \u2014 the musician\u2019s ability to influence the economies of the cities and countries that she visits on her mammoth global tour, which kicked off in March last year in the United States. Fans are likely to fork out \u00a3121 ($153) for accommodation, \u00a3111 ($140) for travel and \u00a359 ($74) in restaurants around the venues, according to Barclays, which based its estimates on customer transaction data and proprietary consumer research. Swift will perform 15 shows across four UK cities in England, Wales and Scotland in June and August. The concerts sold out within minutes of tickets going on sale, with fans spending \u00a3206 ($260) on average on a single ticket, Barclays said. Including the ticket price, UK concertgoers will spend, on average, \u00a3848 ($1,068) each, which is more than 12 times the average cost of a night out in the UK, according to Barclays\u2019 research. While the price tag may seem hefty, it\u2019s much less than many Americans will pay to see the \u201cEras Tour\u201d back home. And it is well worth it for Swifties, says Dr Peter Brooks, chief behavioral scientist at Barclays. \u201cWhen it comes to cultural icons like Taylor Swift \u2014 like we saw with Elvis and Beatlemania in the 50s and 60s \u2014 supporters have such a strong connection to the artist and to the rest of the fandom that the desire to spend becomes even more powerful,\u201d Brooks wrote in the report. \u201cFor \u2018Eras Tour\u2019 ticketholders, every pound they spend is an investment in the memories they\u2019ll create,\u201d he added. Many Swifties are prepared to go to even greater lengths to see their idol live. Almost a fifth of Swift\u2019s fans in the UK who responded to a survey commissioned by Barclays last month said they planned to travel to mainland Europe to see the singer perform. That\u2019s \u201cpossibly due to ticket availability, cheaper travel and accommodation costs, or simply so that (fans) can combine the concert with (a) holiday or city break,\u201d the bank wrote in its report. The European leg of the \u201cEras Tour\u201d includes concerts in Sweden, Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Poland and Austria this year. Some of Swift\u2019s American fans are also choosing to travel overseas to see her perform. Even with flights and accommodation expenses factored in, the overall cost of attending one of Swift\u2019s shows in Europe is often lower than in the United States, where ticket prices are much higher.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/business/taylor-swift-uk-tour-one-billion-boost-economy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_tech_voice-actors-ai-lawsuit-lovo", "text": "Voice actor Paul Skye Lehrman took a job in 2020 for which he believed he was providing a set of one-off voice samples. Years later, he says he heard his voice narrating a YouTube video and then on a podcast \u2014 even though he had never recorded either of them. Now, Lehrman, along with fellow voice actor Linnea Sage, is suing AI firm Lovo for allegedly commissioning them for voice projects under false pretenses in order to create and sell AI-generated versions of their voices. The Berkeley, California based tech company advertises AI-generated voice technology to be used in marketing, education and product demos. Lehrman and Sage are suing Lovo and seeking class action status to include other people \u201cwhose voices and/or identities were stolen and used,\u201d according to the complaint filed Thursday in the Southern District Court of New York. The complaint was first reported by the New York Times. The voice actors\u2019 lawsuit is just the latest in a recent string of legal actions brought against various tech companies by creatives, writers and artists who say their work was used without their permission to train AI systems that could ultimately compete with them. Such lawsuits have added to a growing wave of concerns over how the training of AI models, which requires huge swaths of data, could run afoul of copyright and intellectual property laws. \u201cImplicit in LOVO\u2019s offerings to its customers is that each voice-over actor has agreed to LOVO\u2019s terms and conditions for customers to be able to access that actor\u2019s voice,\u201d the complaint states. But for Lehrman and Sage and any others \u201cwho have not agreed to LOVO\u2019s terms, the continued unauthorized use of Plaintiffs\u2019 voices is theft of service and misappropriation.\u201d Lovo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. In May 2020, Lehrman says he received a request for voice-over narrative services on the gig work website Fiverr from an account called \u201cUser25199087.\u201d When he asked what the voice sample was for, he was told it would be used \u201cfor academic research purposes only\u201d and that \u201cthe scripts would not be used for anything else,\u201d according to the complaint. He was paid $1,200 for the job, the complaint states. Two years later, Lehrman came across a YouTube video that sounded as if it had his voice narrating it, although he\u2019d never been involved in its creation, the complaint states. Then in June 2023, Lehrman claims he heard his voice being used on a podcast about the dangers of AI technologies. Similarly, Sage was offered a job on Fiverr in 2019 producing \u201ctest scripts for radio ads\u201d that she was told would \u201cnot be disclosed externally,\u201d according to the complaint. She was paid $400. Sage says she later also discovered her voice in a YouTube video: a recording of a Lovo investor presentation demonstrating its technology. Lehrman and Sage allege that the people who contacted them on Fiverr were Lovo employees who misrepresented what their voice samples would be used for and later sold or raised money on the back of the AI-version of their voices. \u201cTo be clear, the product that customers purchase from LOVO is stolen property. They are voices stolen by LOVO and marketed by LOVO under false pretenses,\u201d the complaint states. The actors are seeking more than $5 million in damages, as well as a court order blocking Lovo from continuing the alleged use of their voices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/tech/voice-actors-ai-lawsuit-lovo/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

The request comes five months after Neuralink implanted a brain chip into its first human trial participant, 30-year-old Noland Arbaugh, and just a week after the company admitted that his implant had experienced an unexpected problem. Neuralink said that the threads connecting the chip to Arbaugh\u2019s brain had retracted, causing performance issues, although the company said it made adjustments to improve its function. Still, Arbaugh says the implant \u2014 which allows him to control a computer cursor with his brain \u2014 has changed his life. Arbaugh has been a quadriplegic since 2016 following a diving accident. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anything to wake up for in the morning, and this has changed that for me,\u201d Arbaugh told Good Morning America in an interview that aired on Friday. \u201cI was just very happy that I would be a part of something that I believe is so monumental. This is the next step forward of helping people with paralysis.\u201d Now, Neuralink is seeking more people like Arbaugh to test out its brain chip. \u201cIf you have quadriplegia and want to explore new ways of controlling your computer, we invite you to participate in our clinical trial,\u201d the company said on X. Ultimately, Neuralink\u2019s ambition\u00a0is to use\u00a0implants to connect human brains to computers to help, for example, paralyzed people to control smartphones or computers or blind people to regain sight. Like existing brain-machine interfaces, the company\u2019s implant would collect electrical signals sent out by the brain and interpret them as actions. The current trial participants will be part of what Neuralink is calling its PRIME Study, short for Precise\u00a0Robotically\u00a0Implanted Brain-Computer Interface. The intent is to study the safety of its implant and surgical robot and to test the functionality of its device, the company said in a 2023\u00a0blog post. The company says it is enrolling trial patients who have \u201climited or no ability to use both hands due to cervical spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\u201d Trial patients have chips surgically placed in the part of the brain that controls the intention to move. The chip then records and sends brain signals to an app, with the initial goal being \u201cto grant people the ability to control a computer cursor or keyboard using their thoughts alone,\u201d Neuralink previously explained. About a month after the operation, Musk said Arbaugh could control a computer mouse with his brain. Neuralink later posted a video showing Arbaugh using only his brain to play chess on a computer. But after his device developed an unexpected issue stunting its data processing speeds and performance, Arbaugh told Good Morning America that he \u201ccried afterwards.\u201d \u201cIt was very, very hard to give up all of the amazing things that I was able to do,\u201d he said. However, Neuralink says the issue was part of its learning process. \u201cThe reason we do clinical trials and early feasibility trials is to uncover these sorts of issues as early as possible before they get marketed,\u201d\u00a0DJ Seo, who co-founded Neuralink with\u00a0Musk, told Good Morning America. \u201cWe rolled up our sleeves and found various different ways for Noland to be able to recover his performance, which we have successfully been able to do.\u201d Consumers will not have widespread access to the technology anytime soon. Before Neuralink\u2019s brain implants hit the broader market, they\u2019ll need broader regulatory approval. \u2013CNN\u2019s Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report.

Jan Leike, who resigned from his role leading the company\u2019s \u201csuperalignment\u201d team this week, said in a thread on X Friday that he disagreed with OpenAI leadership\u2019s \u201ccore priorities\u201d and had \u201creached a breaking point.\u201d \u201cAlignment\u201d or \u201csuperalignment\u201d are terms used in the artificial intelligence space to refer to work on training AI systems to operate within human needs and priorities. Leike joined OpenAI in 2021, and last summer the company announced that he would co-lead the Superalignment team focused on \u201cscientific and technical breakthroughs to steer and control AI systems much smarter than us.\u201d However, Leike said Friday that in recent months, the team has been under resourced and \u201csailing against the wind.\u201d \u201cSometimes we were struggling for compute and it was getting harder and harder to get this crucial research done,\u201d he said on X, adding that Thursday was his last day at the startup. \u201cBuilding smarter-than-human machines is an inherently dangerous endeavor \u2026 But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.\u201d Leike\u2019s exit, which he announced Wednesday, comes amid a broader leadership shuffle at OpenAI. His resignation followed an announcement by OpenAI Co-Founder and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever, who also helped lead the superalignment team, on Tuesday that he would leave the company. Sutskever said he was leaving to work on a \u201cproject that is very personally meaningful to me.\u201d But his exit was notable given the central role he played in the dramatic firing \u2014 and return \u2014 of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last year, when he voted to remove Altman as chief executive and chairman of the board. CNN contributor Kara Swisher\u00a0previously reported that Sutskever had been concerned that Altman was pushing AI technology \u201ctoo far, too fast.\u201d But days after Altman\u2019s ouster, Sutskever had a change of heart: He signed an employee letter calling for the entire board to resign and for Altman to return. Still, questions about how \u2014 and how quickly \u2014 to develop and publicly release AI technology may have continued to cause tension within the company in the months after Altman regained control of the firm. The executive exits come after OpenAI announced this week that it would make its most powerful AI model yet, GPT-4o, available for free to the public through ChatGPT. The technology will make ChatGPT more like a digital personal assistant, capable of real-time spoken conversations. \u201cI believe much more of our bandwidth should be spent getting ready for the next generations of models, on security, monitoring, preparedness, safety, adversarial robustness, (super)alignment, confidentiality, societal impact, and related topics,\u201d Leike wrote in his X thread on Friday. \u201cThese problems are quite hard to get right, and I am concerned we aren\u2019t on a trajectory to get there.\u201d Asked for comment on Leike\u2019s claims, OpenAI directed CNN to an X post from Altman saying the company is committed to safety. \u201ci\u2019m super appreciative of @janleike\u2019s contributions to openai\u2019s alignment research and safety culture, and very sad to see him leave,\u201d Altman said. \u201che\u2019s right we have a lot more to do; we are committed to doing it. i\u2019ll have a longer post in the next couple of days.\u201d \u2013CNN\u2019s Samantha Delouya contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_17_business_critical-minerals-shortage-clean-energy", "text": "The world is facing a shortage of the minerals needed to make the electric vehicles, wind turbines, solar panels, and other clean energy technologies essential to ending its reliance on fossil fuels. The Paris-based International Energy Agency said in a report published Friday that steep drops in the prices of lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite last year were \u201cgood news for consumers\u201d but discouraged investment in the mining of those critical minerals. The world is on track meet only 70% of global copper demand and 50% of lithium demand by 2035, the agency added. \u201cThe world\u2019s appetite for technologies such as solar panels, electric cars and batteries is growing fast \u2014 but we cannot satisfy it without reliable and expanding supplies of critical minerals,\u201d Fatih Birol, the IEA\u2019s executive director, said in a statement. Investment in critical minerals mining grew 10% last year, a rate the agency says is \u201chealthy, but slower than in 2022.\u201d The IEA forecast that investors would need to pour $800 billion into mining projects between now and 2040 to stand a chance of limiting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Prices for some critical minerals have returned to their lower pre-pandemic levels, the IEA noted, with those needed to make batteries falling particularly sharply. The price declines were caused by a \u201cstrong increase\u201d in supply that outpaced growth in demand over the past two years, the IEA said. However, \u201ctoday\u2019s well-supplied market may not be a good guide for the future, as demand for critical minerals continues to rise,\u201d it added. Demand for graphite, for example, is projected to quadruple by 2040 from the current level if the world takes steps to avoid warming above 1.5 degrees. The price of lithium cratered 75% in 2023, while prices for cobalt, nickel and graphite plunged between 30% and 45%. Those falls helped drive down the price of batteries by 14%, according to the IEA. Concentration risks Concentration of critical minerals production in a small number of countries increases the risk of shortages, the agency warned. It expects that, between now and 2030, as much as 75% of growth in the supply of lithium, nickel, cobalt, and rare earth elements will come from just a handful of countries. For the types of graphite used in batteries, nearly 95% of supply growth will likely come from China, the IEA said. \u201cThese high levels of supply concentration represent a risk for the speed of energy transitions, as it makes supply chains and routes more vulnerable to disruption, whether from extreme weather, trade disputes or geopolitics,\u201d the agency said. \u201cHigh market concentration means there is a risk of significant shortfalls in supply if, for any reason, supply from the largest producing country is interrupted.\u201d Scientists consider warming of 1.5 degrees a\u00a0threshold\u00a0beyond which extreme heat, floods, droughts, wildfires, and food and water shortages would have catastrophic consequences.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/business/critical-minerals-shortage-clean-energy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_business_gen-z-credit-card-users", "text": "Ariel Barnes plunged into a credit card debt spiral in college, and a decade later she\u2019s yet to escape. Barnes has maxed out seven credit cards and is struggling to make minimum payments on $30,000 of credit card debt. \u201cThe interest is so high that it\u2019s hard to get out of it,\u201d Barnes, who is 28 years old and lives in Jackson, Mississippi, told CNN in a phone interview on Thursday. Barnes is hardly alone. Roughly one in seven (15.3%) Gen Z credit card borrowers have maxed out their credit cards, according to\u00a0new research\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. (The NY Fed defined Gen Z as borrowers born between 1995 and 2011, though\u00a0others mark the cut off\u00a0as 1996 or 1997). By comparison, just 4.8% of Baby Boomer borrowers and 9.6% of Gen Xers have maxed out their credit cards, which can be a sign of a severely tight cash-flow problem. The findings underscore starkly different conditions masked by national economic statistics. Barnes blames bad financial decisions when she was in college for her current situation, which has forced her to live at home and delay major life events. \u201cI want children. The clock is ticking. But I can\u2019t afford to have any children,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had to go to therapy because it is a lot mentally.\u201d More and more Americans of all ages are falling behind on their bills \u2014 especially credit card bills. The NY Fed found that for all debt outside of student loans, delinquency rates have been steadily rising since tumbling to historic lows during the Covid-19 pandemic. Credit card delinquencies have surpassed pre-pandemic levels and continue to rise. Severe credit card delinquencies, those 90 days overdue, have now climbed to 10.7% \u2014 the highest since 2012. The findings show how pockets of financial stress continue to emerge in the US economy following three years of high inflation. \u201cIt is worrisome that so many Gen Zers are falling behind,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate.com. \u201dWe\u2019re seeing more people financing daily essentials such as groceries and gas, and this can be a tough cycle to break.\u201d \u2018Cause for concern\u2019 Even as stocks on Wall Street hit historic highs and unemployment remains unusually low, millions of Americans are struggling with the cost of living. \u201cThe rise in severe delinquencies \u2014 those over 90 days overdue \u2014 is a cause for concern,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY. The NY Fed found there is a direct link between maxing out credit cards and falling behind on payments. Very few Americans who have used 20% or less of their credit card limit have fallen behind on their bills, according to the research. However, the transition rate into delinquency for those who have used more than 60% of their credit card limit has now surpassed pre-Covid levels and continues to rise, the NY Fed said. A third of maxed-out borrowers are delinquent The researchers said this trend is \u201cespecially remarkable\u201d for those who have maxed out their cards, defined as using 90% to 100% of their limit. A third of maxed-out borrowers have gone delinquent in the last year, compared with less than a quarter before the pandemic, the NY Fed said. \u201cWhile most commentators discuss a soft landing for\u00a0the\u00a0economy or\u00a0the\u00a0consumer,\u201d Daco said, \u201cthe latest evidence on credit conditions points to multiple economies, multiple consumers, affected to different degrees by the higher cost and higher interest rate environment.\u201d Maxing out credit cards can hurt borrowers\u2019 credit scores. Under FICO Score\u2019s calculation, the ratio of balance-to-credit limit is the second most important category for determining credit scores. \u201cFICO will be closely monitoring this trend in the coming quarters to better understand whether this is simply a reversion to pre-pandemic consumer behaviors,\u201d Tommy Lee, senior director at FICO, told CNN in an email. The NY Fed explained that part of the reason Gen Z borrowers are maxed out is because they have much lower credit limits. Many younger Americans haven\u2019t had the time to build credit histories and credit scores that would let them borrow more. For instance, the median Gen Z borrower\u2019s credit limit is just $4,500, compared with $16,300 for Millennials and $21,800 for Gen X, the NY Fed said. The NY Fed declined to share historical data on maxed out credit cards by generation. During a call with reporters, NY Fed researchers explained that it\u2019s a \u201ctypical age pattern\u201d where younger borrowers have used up more of their credit card limit. Lee, the FICO executive, said history shows that as consumers age and their credit experience increases, so do their credit limits. Americans in low-income areas are more likely to be maxed out Of course, it\u2019s not just younger users maxing out their credit cards. The NY Fed found that borrowers who live in low-income areas are also more likely to be maxed out. About 12% of borrowers living in neighborhoods with the bottom 25% of incomes have maxed out their cards, the report found. That\u2019s more than twice the 5.5% of borrowers living in the highest income neighborhoods who are maxed out. There\u2019s never a good time to carry a credit card balance, but right now is arguably the worst time. The average credit card interest rate stands at 20.66%, according to Bankrate. That\u2019s just shy of the record high of 20.75% set last month. Daco said officials at the Federal Reserve must take into account the credit card stress some Americans are feeling as they decide when to lower interest rates. The Fed faces a delicate balance. Cutting rates prematurely could make inflation worse. But waiting too long could pile even more pressure on borrowers, especially if the jobs market slows and more people struggle to find work. \u201cThe risk of over-tightening could lead to unintended consequences that further strain household finances,\u201d Daco said. Ways to get out of debt Experts say there are possible solutions for people who feel trapped by credit card debt. Rossman, the Bankrate analyst, said options include: \u201cI know it\u2019s easier said than done,\u201d Rossman said, \u201cbut it\u2019s so important to make credit card debt payoff a priority.\u201d CNN\u2019s Alicia Wallace contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/business/gen-z-credit-card-users/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. It\u2019s not just meme stocks that saw a resurgence this week. Beaten-down clean energy stocks have rallied this week. The iShares Global Clean Energy exchange-traded fund, which tracks sectors from renewable electricity to semiconductors to solar energy, has gained roughly 3%. Plug Power shares have climbed 33%, Enphase Energy shares have gained 8% and NextEra Energy shares have added 4%. Behind the rally? President Joe Biden is raising tariffs on $18 billion in Chinese imports across sectors including steel and aluminum, electric vehicles, solar cells and medical products. The new rates range from 100% on electric vehicles to 50% on solar components to 25% for the other sectors, reports CNN\u2019s Kayla Tausche. \u201cChina can\u2019t be the only country that produces clean technology for the world we need,\u201d a senior Biden administration official said. \u201cWe need diversified, not concentrated, production of our most critical goods and technologies. \u2026 That\u2019s the kind of dynamic we think will produce resilient supply chains and clean technology.\u201d Clean energy stocks were battered last year by supply chain snarls and sky-high interest rates, which drove up borrowing costs for growing companies trying to load up on capital. Hopes that an influx of US government spending on climate solutions would help revive the sector didn\u2019t pan out, either. Higher rates also tend to make it more difficult for consumers to transition to using clean energy, since sources like a residential solar system can cost thousands of dollars and require a loan. While some investors hoped that the Federal Reserve would begin cutting rates this year, the central bank has continued to hold rates at a 23-year high. Some investors warn that though the tariffs could continue boosting clean energy stocks, the recent rally isn\u2019t driven by just improving fundamentals. The surge is also in part due to traders\u2019 willingness to take on more risk in their portfolios as stocks continue notching record highs, they say. \u201cThe investment thesis post-tariffs in the sector is better than it was before. But that doesn\u2019t mean that all these companies are out of the woods,\u201d\u00a0Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told CNN. Wall Street\u2019s large risk appetite was in full force this week. Shares of meme stocks such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment have swung wildly after the Roaring Kitty X account run by Keith Gill, a trader who helped spawn the 2021 meme stock frenzy, posted for the first time in three years. Meme stocks are shares of companies that tend to see wide swings based on their popularity on social media rather than their fundamentals. Dow briefly tops 40,000 for first time but ends the day lower The Dow Jones Industrial Average broke past the 40,000 threshold Thursday for the first time ever, fueled by an encouraging inflation report, reports my colleague Nicole Goodkind. The blue-chip index briefly crossed the key threshold in morning trading before falling back below the line in the afternoon to close at 39,869, down 38 points, or 0.1%. All three major indexes closed lower on Thursday. The S&P 500 ended the day down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.3% lower. Markets had rallied to new record highs Wednesday after the latest Consumer Price Index showed a cooldown for the first time in months, stoking hopes that the Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates as soon as September. On a monthly basis, the inflation report showed that prices rose 0.3%, a slower pace than in the two months prior, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists were expecting a 0.4% monthly increase, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Another key data point added to the enthusiasm: April retail sales came in significantly weaker than expected, indicating that consumers are pulling back on the spending that drives the economy. Spending missed the 0.4% increase that economists had projected. \u201cThis is the first good CPI report in four months and the market likes it,\u201d said Gary Pzegeo, head of fixed income at CIBC Private Wealth US. \u201cTaken [together with retail sales] this supports a Fed rate cut in the fall. Markets are discounting a cut in September and have moved to price in a second cut by December.\u201d Read more here. Damaging hacks expose the weak underbelly of America\u2019s health care system A pair of recent ransomware attacks crippled computer systems at two major American health care firms, disrupting patient care and exposing fundamental weaknesses in the US health care system\u2019s defenses against hackers, reports my colleague Sean Lyngaas. In both cases, federal officials and private cyber experts scrambled to try to limit the damage and get computers back online. But the cascading effects from the hacks, with ambulances diverted from hospitals and pharmacies unable to process insurance, has underscored for some US lawmakers, senior Biden administration officials and policy experts that the health care system is ill-prepared for the ripple effects of a cyberattack and needs new security regulations. Health care lags other industries, such as big financial institutions and energy providers, when it comes to IT security, according to some experts. \u201cIndustry has successfully demanded voluntary cybersecurity for years \u2014 and this is what we get,\u201d Joshua Corman, a cybersecurity expert who has focused on the health sector for years, told CNN.

However, history and research have shown that the economic effects often fail to live up to the hype. On Tuesday, the Biden administration announced the latest iteration of American import taxes: a wave of new and heightened tariffs on Chinese exports across a slew of industries deemed strategic to national security. Economists expect that the newly announced $18 billion in tariffs likely will have a minimal near-term impact on GDP, inflation and monetary policy \u2014 some equating it to a mere \u201crounding error.\u201d However, on a broader level, the picture could be more complex. \u201cThe tariffs announced on China by the Biden administration foreshadow what is going to be a long, cold winter of economic conflict between the US and China,\u201d economist Joe Brusuelas at RSM US told CNN. The latest tariffs build upon former President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping $300 billion program in 2018 and 2019, which levied tariffs heavily against China and a variety of other trading partners and is still in effect. Trump has made campaign trail promises for even steeper tariffs if he were elected \u2014 not just for China but an across-the-board 10% tariff on all imports, which economists have said would not only result in significant job losses in the US but also stoke inflation. Economic growth, inflation and the Fed The latest tariffs, which would roll out some time between\u00a0now\u00a0and 2026, come amid a solid job market, robust economic growth and strong consumer spending \u2014 but also a continuing battle against decades-high\u00a0inflation\u00a0that is keeping interest\u00a0rates\u00a0higher. Biden\u2019s tariff plan likely won\u2019t move the needle for monetary policy, said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. \u201cThe additional tariffs are essentially a rounding error for inflation and GDP, carrying no implications for monetary policy,\u201d Sweet wrote in a note issued Monday, when reports first indicated that changes to the US tariff policy were forthcoming. \u201cThe Fed will not make a mountain out of a mole hill, so the tariffs will not provide additional ammunition to justify keeping interest rates high for longer.\u201d On Tuesday, after learning the fuller scope of the Biden administration\u2019s tariffs, Sweet told CNN those expectations shouldn\u2019t change significantly. Domestic manufacturing In 2002, when President George W. Bush placed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum products, studies show that while it only cost the economy $30 million, it resulted in higher prices for American steel-consuming industries and led to a steep loss of jobs throughout the steel industry, especially among smaller firms that didn\u2019t have the market power to influence prices. Seven years later, when President Barack Obama increased tariffs on tires imported from China, the initiative was credited with saving about 1,200 jobs in the US tire manufacturing industry, but came at a $1.1 billion cost to Americans in the form of higher prices, the Peterson Institute for International Economics found. The 2018 tariffs imposed by Trump did not result in an immediate boost to manufacturing employment but instead led to a net loss of jobs and rising prices for consumers due to higher input costs and retaliatory tariffs, Federal Reserve economists noted in a 2019 paper. Costs to consumers Tariffs typically make more political sense than economic sense, Sweet noted. \u201cMost economists view tariffs as a bad idea because they prevent a country from reaping the benefits of specialization, disrupt the movement of goods and services, and lead to a misallocation of resources,\u201d Sweet wrote. \u201cConsumers and producers often pay higher prices when tariffs are implemented.\u201d That\u2019s because tariffs tax imports when they come ashore, adding costs for US distributors, retailers and, ultimately, consumers. The US International Trade Commission said in a\u00a02023 study\u00a0that US importers \u201cbore nearly the full cost\u201d of the Trump tariffs. Worse, some businesses appeared to take advantage of the trade war by bumping up prices even higher. Goldman Sachs found that tariffs allowed US producers and non-Chinese exporters to the US market to \u201copportunistically raise their prices as well.\u201d The New York Fed found that the 2018 tariffs cost US households $419 per year because of higher tax burdens and market efficiency losses. Researchers estimated that would double as the tariffs went into effect in 2019. As more time has passed, the positive economic effects have become even less clear cut. The net economic effect of the import tariffs, retaliatory tariffs and agricultural subsidies \u201cwas at best a wash, and it may have been mildly negative,\u201d to US jobs and businesses, economists wrote in a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper published in January 2024. The trade war did appear to have political benefits in strengthening support for the Republican party in the US heartland and communities most affected by the tariffs, researchers noted in the NBER working paper. \u201cResidents of tariff-protected locations became less likely to identify as Democrats and more likely to vote for President Trump,\u201d they wrote. \u201cVoters thus appear to have responded favorably to the extension of tariff protections to local industries despite their economic cost.\u201d The flow of imports The Covid-19 pandemic\u2019s discombobulating effects on supply chains distort the full picture of how the 2018-2019 tariffs affected US manufacturing and trade. US importers had started to substitute away from Chinese goods, but once the pandemic struck and US consumer demand increased, domestic inventory levels drew down quickly and China imports ramped back up, Wells Fargo economists wrote in an April note. However, by the end of 2023, imports from China were down 3% relative to 2019 while there was a 50% growth in imports from South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam, Nicole Cervi, an economist at Wells Fargo, told CNN in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely some data to suggest that we\u2019ve seen stronger imports from countries outside of China, and some of it may be that Chinese businesses are perhaps relocating some of their operations to these other countries that are not being affected by the Section 301 tariffs,\u201d Cervi said. Recent ocean and air freight data gives further rise to suspicions that China may be trying to circumvent US tariffs via Mexico, said Peter Sand, chief analyst with Xeneta, an ocean and air freight analytics and logistics company. Container shipping imports from China to Mexico rocketed higher by 60% in January and 34% for the first quarter, Xeneta data shows. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot,\u201d Sand told CNN in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s staggering.\u201d What was once an immature trade lane is now one of the busiest in the world, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that imports to this extent are not only for domestic purposes in Mexico,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/economy/inflation-new-china-tariffs-biden-example/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_tech_ai-high-school", "text": "At Princeton High School, students are trying to combat the rapid decline of indigenous languages with some unlikely help: a furry, wide-eyed stuffed animal named Che\u2019w. But Che\u2019w isn\u2019t a standard plush toy. He\u2019s a wildly intelligent generative AI robot that speaks Mam, a Mayan language spoken in the western highlands of Guatemala and Mexico and by a small population of the school\u2019s students.\u00a0The language is currently at risk of extinction, according to UNESCO; the students hope Che\u2019w can help change that. At a time when some high schools are restricting the use of AI in the classroom, others, like Princeton High School, are leaning into it. In the short 18 months since the launch of viral chatbot ChatGPT, generative AI has emerged as a revolutionary technology in the field of artificial intelligence. Its capabilities have impressed both users and experts with its ability to perform a range of tasks, from generating creative content, essays and games to conducting mathematical equations, summarizing complicated concepts and more. All that is already reshaping various parts of our lives, including education. But the technology has leaped ahead far faster, in many cases, than schools\u2019 understanding of how to use it. And with new products out this week from Google\u2019s XYZ initiative and OpenAI\u2019s new GPT-4o, many teachers and districts realize they cannot avoid the subject. Dr. Joy Barnes-Johnson, the science administrator for PHS, said the school is \u201ctrying to embrace AI\u201d as much as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s a tool, just like a pencil is technology that helps communication.\u201d She said the school will host an AI summit this summer with its teachers and administrators to have a conversation about how generative AI should or shouldn\u2019t be used in the classroom. \u201cIn the beginning of the school year, we talked about how AI is the world we\u2019re in now and we have a responsibility to prepare kids for the world they will inherit,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea is that it will help people connect and learn, so we [as teachers] have to not be afraid of it.\u201d Proceeding with caution When ChatGPT launched in November 2022, teachers worried that the tool, which can generate convincing responses and essays in response to user prompts, could make it easier for students to cheat on assignments. Some also worried ChatGPT and similar tools could be used to spread inaccurate information. Not long after its launch, New York City public schools became one of the first school districts to ban students and teachers from using ChatGPT on the district\u2019s networks and devices. Other schools reacted similarly in the weeks and months that followed, including the Los Angeles Unified School District and Seattle Public Schools, which blocked access to ChatGPT on their networks. Some of these districts have evolved their policies over time. The LAUSD, for example, has since launched a chatbot named \u201cEd\u201d to act as a student advisor, with the ability to inform parents about information ranging from children\u2019s test results to their school attendance. Many schools also continue to grapple with how to best approach the technology inside the classroom. \u201cThere is acceptance by educators, but we\u2019re still seeing a lot of caution,\u201d said Noel Candelaria, the secretary-treasurer of the National Education Association who is leading the charge around the union\u2019s AI policy. \u201cThe challenge is there isn\u2019t a lot of guidance on the district level, so the concern educators have is that it\u2019s being something done to them, instead of with them.\u201d He added: \u201cThere are also major concerns around data confidentiality and where data is being pulled from.\u201d Candelaria told CNN that educators feel strongly that they want their voice to influence how it can be applied to schools. The NEA is developing a task force with educators across the country to address many of these issues. Beyond generative AI Some high schools around the country are\u00a0trying to teach students how to use other forms of artificial intelligence for a greater good. At one prestigious public school in New York City, Stuyvesant High School, students created an app for the blind that uses artificial intelligence and tactile feedback to help people detect threats and navigate obstacles.  Similarly, at STEM School Highlands Ranch in Colorado, a team of students developed an AI-powered\u00a0wildlife detection system called Project Deer to help cut down on car crashes. Although researchers have tried to combat such accidents before, studies have shown wildlife don\u2019t consistently react to any one stimulus. So the students instead derived an AI-based predictive solution to alert the driver to an imminent threat on the road. Using four $5 infrared detection sensors placed on vehicles, the students developed a system for\u00a0AI to scan the surroundings and emit a high-pitched sound when an animal\u2019s body heat is detected, a signal that may help to scare the animal away. The school, which was the\u00a0Colorado State Winner in Samsung\u2019s annual Solve for Tomorrow competition, said it is partnering with the University of Colorado in Boulder this summer to help boost its success rate. The Solve for Tomorrow contest featured more than 1,000 schools submitting STEM-based solutions to real-world problems. Samsung told CNN there was a \u201cdefinite uptick in\u201d submitted AI-powered innovations this year compared to previous years. Computer science teacher Tylor Chacon told CNN the group\u2019s big vision is to one day have the technology regulated or adopted by the state for greater use. School administration has told teachers to help create rubrics or lesson plans, Chacon told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019ve been encouraged to embrace it and look into ways we can use it to maximize our own job effectiveness and ease the burden on us,\u201d he said. It\u2019s an increasingly common trend among teachers to use AI tools to create assignments, quizzes, polls, videos and interactives for classroom use. Some are even turning to AI tools and platforms \u2014 such as ChatGPT, Writable, Grammarly and EssayGrader \u2014 to assist with grading papers or writing feedback, a practice that is also raising ethical considerations. Saving a language, learning the future Still, as schools continue to weigh the benefits or disadvantages to teaching and using artificial intelligence, some teachers and administrators feel strongly that it\u2019s the future. At Princeton High, a group of about 14 students met during school hours for months to build out Che\u2019w\u2019s conversational capabilities, drawn from artificial intelligence neural networks that are trained to recognize patterns, solve problems and understand words, sentences and phrases from spoken and written language. Che\u2019w, which translates to \u201cstar\u201d in Mam, was trained to understand the language by the students so it can serve as a personal tutor. The robot is also trained to speak Spanish and English. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t lose patience or get sick of talking to them,\u201d said Mark Eastburn, Princeton High School\u2019s science, research and engineering teacher. \u201cIt\u2019s taking [AI] off the screen and putting it onto a physical structure that looks like a friend that can help you do whatever you need to do.\u201d In April, the students were one of the top three National Winners at the Samsung Solve For Tomorrow\u2019s competition. AI is now a part of students\u2019 lives, Eastburn said. \u201cAnd it will be there when they\u2019re in college and also in their careers,\u201d he added, \u201cso they might as well learn and use it in appropriate ways in high school, if not even earlier.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/tech/ai-high-school/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_media_trump-hush-money-trial-reporters-spotlight", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. The\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0hush money trial is dragging reporters into uncomfortable territory and laying bare the complicated relationships journalists often have with sources. Michael Cohen, who continued to testify Thursday, invoked from the stand the names of several high-profile media figures, putting their relationships with the former Trump fixer in the spotlight. Cohen named\u00a0The New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman\u00a0and\u00a0MSNBC\u2019s Katy Tur\u00a0as reporters which he had established relationships with. He alleged without evidence that\u00a0ABC News\u2019 John Santucci\u00a0had tried to pay for the rights to\u00a0Stormy Daniels\u2019 story. And he spoke about having recorded dozens of phone calls with media figures, including former\u00a0CNN\u00a0boss\u00a0Jeff Zucker. To be clear, a reporter having working relationships with sources is not unethical \u2014 it\u2019s often a hallmark of being a strong journalist and it does not translate into taking orders or publishing unvetted information. Reputable news outlets like ABC News do not pay for interviews, but trying to secure a sit-down with a high-profile subject is anything but uncommon. And speaking on the phone with a source while the person on the other end of the line secretly records says a lot more about that individual than the journalist. For now, much of what has been described by Cohen in court appears to be routine, run-of-the-mill behavior that occurs each and every day in journalism. But the general public does not work in a newsroom, and regular interactions with sources can be framed in such a way that removes key context and portrays a routine reporting process as nefarious. That context is crucial. For example, Haberman has indisputably been one of the most authoritative reporters on Trump. For years, her byline has dogged the Queens-born developer-turned-politician, exposing corruption, revealing embarrassing secrets, and shedding light on his authoritarian impulses. In return, Trump has ranted and raged at her endlessly. The notion that Haberman is a commissioned stenographer for Trump is preposterous. But for Haberman \u2014\u00a0or any reporter\u00a0\u2014 to get information from Trump-world requires cultivating thorny relationships with sources, many of whom are slimy figures. It is neither unusual nor unethical for journalists to be cordial to the sources whom they get information from. That does not mean they print whatever these sources send them or function as their mouthpieces. It simply means that they have established a relationship that is conducive to the flow and exchange of information. And when the journalist deems that information to be newsworthy, they might then be able to publish it for the world to see. It\u2019s also worth noting that many of the top journalists covering Trump world have complex histories with the key figures in the case. A witness like Cohen or an attorney like\u00a0Todd Blanche\u00a0might be motivated to cast various journalists in unflattering light. In many ways, the Trump hush money trial has become something of a Rorschach test. People see what they want to see, ignoring evidence before their eyes that runs counter to their chosen narrative. And for the faction of the public that believes some members of the press are too cozy with Trump world, seeing Cohen discuss his relationships with the news media has only reinforced their views. That reporters are playing a starring role in the trial is also a function of the Trump years. The former president, seeking to use the news media as a foil, cast the journalists covering him as characters in his unrelenting show. Through vile attacks, he moved the reporters from behind the scenes onto the front lines. And so now, amid his criminal trial, it is fitting that members of the press are once again finding themselves in the awkward position of being part of the very story they are covering.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/media/trump-hush-money-trial-reporters-spotlight/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_tech_google-ai-gmail-photos-developers-conference", "text": "A day after OpenAI impressed with a startlingly improved ChatGPT AI model, Google showed off an equally stunning vision for how AI will improve the products that billions of people use every day. The updates, announced at its annual Google I/O developer conference, come as the company is trying to push beyond its core advertising business with new devices and AI-powered tools. Artificial intelligence was so top of mind during the event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said at the end of the presentation the term \u201cAI\u201d was said 120 times \u2013 as counted by none other than its AI platform Gemini. During the keynote, Google showed how it wants its AI products to become a bigger part of users\u2019 lives, such as by sharing information, interacting with others, finding objects around the house, making schedules, shopping and using an Android device. Google essentially wants its AI to be part of everything you do. Pichai kicked off the event by highlighting various new features powered by its latest AI model Gemini 1.5 Pro. One new feature, called Ask Photos, allows users to search photos for deeper insights, such as asking when your daughter learned to swim or recall what your license plate number is, by looking through saved pictures. He also showed how users can ask Gemini 1.5 Pro to summarize all recent emails from your child\u2019s school by analyzing attachments, and summarizing key points and spitting out action items. Meanwhile, Google executives took turns demonstrating other capabilities, such as how the latest model could \u201cread\u201d a textbook and turn it into a kind of AI lecture featuring natural-sounding teachers that answer questions. Just one day before, OpenAI \u2014 one of the tech industry\u2019s leaders in artificial intelligence \u2014 unveiled a new AI model that it says will make chatbot ChatGPT smarter and easier to use. GPT-4o aims to turn ChatGPT into a digital personal assistant that can engage in real-time, spoken conversations and interact using text and \u201cvision.\u201d It can view screenshots, photos, documents or charts uploaded by users and have a conversation about them. Google also showed off Gemini\u2019s latest abilities to take different kinds of input \u2014 \u201cmultimodal\u201d capabilities to take in text, voice or images \u2014 as a direct response to ChatGPT\u2019s efforts. A Google executive also demoed a virtual \u201cteammate\u201d that can help stay on top of to-do lists, organize data and manage workflow. The company also highlighted search improvements by allowing users to ask more natural or more focused questions, and providing various versions of the responses, such as in-depth or summarized results. It can also make targeted suggestions, such as recommending kid friendly restaurants in certain locations, or note what might be wrong with a gadget, such as a camera, by taking a video of the issue via Google Lens. The goal is to take the legwork out of searching on Google, the company said. The company also briefly teased Project Astra, developed by Google\u2019s DeepMind AI lab, which will allow AI assistants to help users\u2019 everyday lives by using phone cameras to interpret information about the real world, such as identifying objects and even finding misplaced items. It also hinted at how it would work on augmented reality glasses. Google said that later this year it will integrate more AI functions into phones. For example, users will be able to drag and drop images created by AI into Google Messages and Gmail and ask questions about YouTube videos and PDFs on an Android device. And in a move that will likely appeal to many, a new built-in tool for Android will help detect suspicious activity in the middle of a call, such as a scammer trying to imitate a user\u2019s bank. According to analyst Jacob Bourne, from market research firm Emarketer, it\u2019s no surprise AI took center stage at this year\u2019s Google developer conference. \u201cBy showcasing its latest models and how they\u2019ll power existing products with strong consumer reach, Google is demonstrating how it can effectively differentiate itself from rivals,\u201d he said. He believes the reception of the new tools will be an indicator of how well Google can adapt its search product to meet the demands of the generative AI era. \u201cTo maintain its competitive edge and satisfy investors, Google will need to focus on translating its AI innovations into profitable products and services at scale,\u201d he said. As the company grows its AI footprint, it said it will introduce more protections to cut down on potential misuse. Google is expanding its existing SynthID feature to detect AI-generated content. Last year, the tool added watermarks to AI-generated images and audio. Google said it is also partnering with experts and institutions to test and improve the capabilities in its new models. Although the company has doubled down on artificial intelligence in the past year, it also met significant roadblocks. Last year, shortly after introducing its generative AI tool \u2014 then called Bard and since renamed Gemini \u2014 Google\u2019s share price dropped after a demo video of the tool showed it producing a factually inaccurate response to a question about the James Webb Space Telescope. More recently, the company hit pause in February on Gemini\u2019s ability to generate images of people after it was blasted on social media for producing historically inaccurate images that largely showed people of color in place of White people. Gemini, like other AI tools such as ChatGPT, is trained on vast troves of online data. Experts have long warned about the shortcomings around AI tools, such as the potential for inaccuracies, biases and the spreading of misinformation. Still, many companies are forging ahead on AI tools or partnerships. Apple may be interested in licensing and building Google\u2019s Gemini AI engine, which includes chatbots and other AI tools, into upcoming iPhones and its iOS 18 features, Bloomberg reported in March. The company is also reportedly talking to ChatGPT creator OpenAI.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/tech/google-ai-gmail-photos-developers-conference/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_business_boeing-justice-department-criminal-prosecution", "text": "The US Justice Department on Tuesday notified Boeing that it breached terms of\u00a0its\u00a02021 agreement in which the company avoided criminal charges for two fatal 737 Max crashes. After a series of safety missteps earlier this year, including a door plug that blew off an Alaska Airlines flight shortly after takeoff in January, the Department of Justice said Boeing is now subject to criminal prosecution. \u201cFor failing to fulfill completely the terms of and obligations under the [deferred prosecution agreement], Boeing is subject to prosecution by the United States for any federal criminal violation of which the United States has knowledge,\u201d the Justice Department said in a letter to US District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor in Fort Worth, Texas, who oversaw the prior agreement. The Biden administration said in its letter that it has not yet determined how it will proceed, however, and Boeing will have an opportunity to respond to its breach of the agreement \u2013 and steps it has taken to remediate the situation \u2013 by June 13. It will let the court know by July 7 how it will proceed with the case. Boeing, in a statement, said it has upheld its end of the bargain. \u201cWe believe that we have honored the terms of that agreement, and look forward to the opportunity to respond to the Department on this issue,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cAs we do so, we will engage with the Department with the utmost transparency, as we have throughout the entire term of the agreement.\u201d The notification comes as the Justice Department conducts a new investigation into Boeing\u2019s operations in the wake the door plug incident. The earlier deal had resolved a fraud investigation related to the company\u2019s development of its 737 Max aircraft. Under its deferred prosecution agreement from January 2021, Boeing paid $2.5 billion in penalties and promised to improve its safety and compliance protocols. Families of victims of the October 2018 Lion Air 737 Max crash and the March 2019 Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crash had long denounced the delayed prosecution agreement, arguing it denied them justice for the deaths of their loved ones. Families of victims and lawyers representing them met with the Justice Department late last month to persuade the Biden administration to end the agreement in light of multiple safety lapses at Boeing this year and in past years after the 2021 agreement was reached. Following the April 2024 meeting, attorney Paul Cassell, who represents the victims\u2019 families, said at a press conference that the deferred prosecution agreement was \u201crigged\u201d and brokered without families\u2019 say. Cassell pledged to hold Boeing accountable for its \u201cfraud and misconduct.\u201d On Tuesday, Cassell said, \u201cThis is a positive first step, and for the families, a long time coming. But we need to see further action from DOJ to hold Boeing accountable, and plan to use our meeting on May 31 to explain in more detail what we believe would be a satisfactory remedy to Boeing\u2019s ongoing criminal conduct.\u201d The Justice Department in its letter said it notified the families that Boeing breached its agreement, and it will continue to confer with families of the crash victims as well as other airline customers about next steps. The Department of Justice plans to meet with the families next on May 31. In Thursday\u2019s letter to the federal judge overseeing the prior agreement, the Justice Department said it had notified the company that \u201cthe government has determined that Boeing breached its obligations\u201d in multiple parts of the 2021 deal \u201cby failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the U.S. fraud laws throughout its operations.\u201d Boeing safety issues following its agreement Despite pledging to clean up its act, Boeing had a seemingly endless run of quality and safety lapses in the years since its deferred prosecution agreement. On September 20, 2021, just months after its agreement, Boeing disclosed it found\u00a0empty tequila bottles\u00a0inside one of the two 747 jets being refurbished for use as the next generation of Air Force One. In April 2023, Boeing announced its supplier used a \u201cnon-standard manufacturing process,\u201d delaying deliveries of the 737 Max. In February 2024, a month after the door plug incident, a preliminary National Transportation Safety Board investigation found that the plane left a Boeing factory missing the four bolts needed to secure the door plug. Later that month, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a report sharply\u00a0critical of the culture\u00a0at Boeing, citing \u201cgaps in Boeing\u2019s safety journey,\u201d and gave Boeing 90 days\u00a0to come up with a plan to fix its problems. Subsequent FAA reports found multiple problems\u00a0with Boeing\u2019s production practices following a six-week audit. In March, the FAA identified more\u00a0potential safety issues\u00a0with the engines of the 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner. Last month, the FAA announced an investigation into\u00a0a whistleblower\u2019s complaint\u00a0that the company took shortcuts when manufacturing its 777 and 787 Dreamliner jets and that those risks could become catastrophic as the airplanes age. The company disputed the complaint.

The A.I. doomsday clock appears ready to strike midnight for publishers. Google\u00a0on Tuesday announced that it will infuse its ubiquitous search engine with its powerful artificial intelligence model,\u00a0Gemini, drawing on the rapidly advancing technology to directly answer user queries at the top of results pages. \u201cGoogle will do the Googling for you,\u201d the company explained. In other words, users will soon no longer have to click on the links displayed in search results to find the information they are seeking. On its surface that might sound convenient, but for news publishers \u2014 many of whom are already struggling with steep traffic declines \u2014 the revamped search experience will likely cause an even\u00a0further\u00a0decrease in audience, potentially starving them of readers and revenue. Why spend time clicking on a link when Google has already scoured the internet and harvested the relevant information with its A.I.? \u201cGoogle will take care of the legwork,\u201d executives said. But a lot of that legwork, of course, comes in the form of human-written articles and expertise published across the internet on blogs and media outlets, all built on a foundation of advertising support. Google\u2019s message was heard loud and clear. Within hours of the Mountain View announcement, the news industry began sounding the alarm. \u201cThis will be catastrophic to our traffic, as marketed by Google to further satisfy user queries, leaving even less incentive to click through so that we can monetize our content,\u201d\u00a0Danielle Coffey, the chief executive of the\u00a0News/Media Alliance, bluntly told CNN. Coffey, whose organization represents more than 2,000 news publishers and has taken an aggressive posture toward A.I. developers\u2019 use of journalism, added: \u201cThe little traffic we get today will be further diminished, and with a dominant search engine that\u2019s cementing its market power, we once again have to adhere to their terms. This time with a product that directly competes with our content, using our content to fuel it. This is a perverse twist on \u2018innovation.\u2019\u201d The announcement from Google, which newsrooms had expected and expressed worry over in both public and private forums in recent months, is poised to further batter an industry that has been dealt a series of brutal blows \u2014\u00a0much of it at the hands of Big Tech\u00a0\u2014 over the last several years. It also comes as\u00a0OpenAI\u00a0reportedly readies to launch its own A.I.-powered search engine. Since\u00a0ChatGPT\u00a0crashed onto the scene more than a year ago, showcasing the potential power of A.I. for the public and setting off an arms race with Google,\u00a0Meta\u00a0and others, publishers have worried greatly about the impact the technology will ultimately have on their businesses. But they have had little time to plan their responses to the transformative technology, given the breakneck pace in which it has developed. Some newsrooms have chosen to cautiously lock arms with the technology giants, striking deals with OpenAI to license their deep archives of content. Others have taken a much different path, with\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0most notably filing a scorched Earth lawsuit against the ChatGPT creator. While publishers once worked hand-in hand with Big Tech companies (remember those days?), their relationships have soured tremendously in recent years.\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg\u00a0most publicly turned his back on the news industry, deprioritizing news articles on his platforms and shutting off other initiatives his company once championed. Google has maintained a better relationship with publishers but also faced sharp criticism. Most recently, it\u00a0drew scorn\u00a0after temporarily blocking some California news outlets from search results in response to a bill that would force it to pay publishers. On Tuesday, likely predicting the panic that its announcement would stir, Google argued that the A.I. changes would actually benefit news companies. Google told CNN it is showing more links with its AI Overviews feature and that by improving the search product, it will allow the company to send more traffic to web publishers. \u201cWe see that the links included in AI Overviews get more clicks than if the page had appeared as a traditional web listing for that query,\u201d Google said in its announcement. \u201cAs we expand this experience, we\u2019ll continue to focus on sending valuable traffic to publishers and creators.\u201d But given Silicon Valley\u2019s track record with publishers, it\u2019s unlikely that the statement will give them much relief. And already there is skepticism over Google\u2019s claims. \u201cOur initial analysis suggests it will significantly reduce search traffic to content creators\u2019 websites, directly impacting their ad revenue and, by extension, their livelihoods,\u201d\u00a0Marc McCollum, chief innovation officer at\u00a0Raptive, which provides services to thousands of only creators and businesses,\u00a0said in a statement. \u201cThis change could put the future of the open internet in danger.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/media/google-gemini-ai-search-news-outlet-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_media_espn-jeff-darlington-scottie-scheffler-arrest", "text": "ESPN journalist Jeff Darlington witnessed the arrest of World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler Friday morning before the second round of the PGA Championship in Louisville, Kentucky, thrusting the reporter into the middle of one of the strangest sports stories in recent memory. Darlington and Scheffler had arrived at the course around the same time in preparation for the tournament. After reportedly attempting to drive around the scene of a fatal crash, Scheffler\u00a0was arrested and charged with a felony and other counts. He was later released and has since teed off in the tournament. Darlington was not only a witness to the incident, he also attempted to intervene. He was only several feet away from Scheffler when the golfer was arrested, and Darlington tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to explain to the police that Scheffler was a participant in the tournament. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be part of this story, we ended up being at least on the periphery,\u201d said ESPN commentator Dave Fleming on air after the incident. ESPN told CNN that the network is not commenting on this story. How the story unfolded Darlington broke the news of Scheffler\u2019s arrest in a series of posts on X and explained the incident in greater detail on ESPN\u2019s SportsCenter less than an hour later. He said the incident occurred around 6 a.m. after a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d in which Scheffler tried to circumvent police presence at the scene of an unrelated car accident that occurred outside of golf club. \u201cThe police officer attempted to attach himself to Scheffler\u2019s car, and Scheffler then stopped his vehicle at the entrance to Valhalla,\u201d Darlington wrote on X. \u201cThe police officer then began to scream at Scheffler to get out of the car. When Scheffler exited the vehicle, the officer shoved Scheffler against the car and immediately placed him in handcuffs.\u201d \u201cAt which point (Scheffler) - seeing me behind him - said \u2018can you help?\u2019 The police officers instructed me to step back,\u201d Darlington told audiences on air shortly after.

He\u2019s been released from jail, according to the Louisville Metro Department of Corrections. Attorney Steve Romines, who represents Scheffler,\u00a0told CNN affiliate WLKY that the golfer bypassed police because of a misunderstanding. \u201cThey were directing traffic, he held his media credential out and was going in like they\u2019d been instructed to,\u201d Romines said.

{"id": "2024_05_17_economy_china-rescue-measures-housing-market-intl-hnk", "text": "China has unveiled wide-ranging measures to rescue its property sector, including asking local governments across the country to buy unsold homes from beleagured developers and easing rules on purchases. Even though China\u2019s economy expanded faster than expected at the start of this year, growth is being weighed down by the all-important real estate sector, which once accounted for as much as 30% of economic activity. He Lifeng, vice premier and the Communist Party\u2019s top economic official, said Friday that municipal governments should buy unsold homes and convert them into affordable social housing, in a plan that has been trailed as a major solution for the country\u2019s crisis-ridden property sector. In a coordinated move, the People\u2019s China of China (PBOC) announced that it will set up a nationwide program to provide 300 billion yuan ($41.5 billion) in loans to fund state purchases of unsold homes. Tao Ling, deputy governor of the central bank, said at a press conference in Beijing that it will encourage commercials banks to support local state-owned enterprises to buy unsold homes and turn them into social housing. The 300 billion yuan provided by the central bank could eventually underpin 500 billion yuan ($69 billion) worth of credit to support such purchases, she estimated. Expectations that Beijing was preparing a plan to have local governments across the country buy millions of unsold homes have successfully buoyed China stocks. Investors have been steadily pouring money back into Chinese shares since last month. China Real Estate Business, a newspaper run by the country\u2019s housing ministry, described the measures as \u201cheavyweight policies\u201d that marked a \u201csignificant historic moment\u201d for the real estate sector.  Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Group, said the move to buy unsold homes was \u201cpositive\u201d for the industry, but that the plan was missing key details such as how much would be funded. \u201cLooking ahead, the key is\u00a0when and at what scale the central government can provide a funding source,\u201d he wrote in a Friday research note. China\u2019s local governments have already racked up $15 trillion in debt, much of it hidden, having borrowed heavily in recent years to cover the cost of pandemic-related spending and infrastructure projects.  Decline in sales, investment Over the past two years, the Chinese authorities have introduced many measures to revive the depressed real estate sector \u2014 to little avail. Analysts have long been calling on them to do much more. Friday\u2019s sweeping rescue measures come as new data suggested the property downturn worsened in April. Government data published Friday showed that property investment declined 9.8% in the first four months of 2024, accelerating from the 9.5% fall recorded in the first quarter. New property sales plunged 28.3% in the January-to-April period, compared with a 27.6% drop in January-March. New home prices\u00a0fell\u00a0for a 10th consecutive month by 0.6% month-on-month in April, the fastest decline since November 2014, according to Reuters. \u201cAll this bad news seems to have finally triggered a sense of urgency that\u2019s strong enough to force material action,\u201d analysts from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale wrote in a note on Friday. The analysts were referring to the government\u2019s announcement, PBOC cuts to mortgage rates and the first batch in the sale of one trillion yuan ($138 billion) of ultra-long Treasury bonds on Friday. On Friday, He also urged local governments to buy back or directly purchase land that has been sold to developers but not yet used. The move would help ease financial difficulties of property companies. In China, land is mostly owned by the state. The government can sell the rights to use the land to property developers, which is a significant source of fiscal revenue. The PBOC also made major additional moves to rescue the housing market. It effectively allowed banks to set their own mortgage rates, removing a nationwide minimum; cut the minimum down-payment ratio for first-time buyers to 15% and 25% for second-home buyers; and lowered the interest rates for housing provident fund loans by 0.25 percentage points, according to three separate statements by the central bank.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/economy/china-rescue-measures-housing-market-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_13_investing_gamestop-roaring-kitty", "text": "The surprise social media return of the trader who helped ignite the meme stock frenzy in 2021 sent GameStop shares skyrocketing Monday. The surge had nothing to do with the troubled company\u2019s fundamentals \u2014 and everything to do with a cartoon of a gamer that the trader, nicknamed Roaring Kitty, shared on X. GameStop shares surged 74% on Monday after the account run by Keith Gill shared a meme on X, marking its first post in three years. The shares skyrocketed by more than 110% earlier and were halted for volatility several times on Monday morning. Short sellers have seen $1 billion in mark-to-market losses betting against GameStop on Monday, according to data company S3 Partners. Short-sellers aim to turn profits on a stock by borrowing shares, selling them and returning them after purchasing them at a lower price. Shares of AMC Entertainment, another meme stock, popped 78%. Reddit shares climbed roughly 9%. Shares of trading platform Robinhood Markets, which suspended purchases\u00a0of\u00a0GameStop,\u00a0AMC and other meme stocks during the frenzy in 2021, rose 4%. The image Gill posted depicts a man leaning forward in a chair with a video game console in hand. GameStop had posted the same cartoon in February, but with a blue arrow and chair. In Gill\u2019s cartoon, they are red. The meme is interpreted to convey, \u201cwhen things get serious,\u201d according to Know Your Meme. Gill did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. GameStop shares tripped multiple circuit breakers \u2014 a temporary and mandated halt in trading to let investors cool off for a bit. Robinhood denied claims on social media on Monday that it had once again halted GameStop stock purchases on its platform. \u201cThis is incorrect. Robinhood has not shut down the purchase of Gamestop shares,\u201d Robinhood spokesperson Anupriya Ghate said in a statement to CNN. \u201cGME is seeing elevated volatility and movement, which triggers market-wide exchange trading limits and halts. These are market-wide and not specific to Robinhood.\u201d Who is Roaring Kitty? Gill, who goes by \u201cDeepf\u2014-ingvalue\u201d on Reddit, was one of the leading forces on the WallStreetBets subreddit that drove eye-popping returns in GameStop\u2019s stock. The traders bid up shares of the retailer, targeting short sellers. The retail investors sent other stocks soaring in 2021, including AMC Entertainment and Bed Bath & Beyond. They are now collectively known as meme stocks, or shares of companies with a cult following that see wide swings based on their popularity among trader communities on social media rather than their fundamentals. Gill described himself as a casual daytime trader in testimony during a 2021 Congressional hearing on the GameStop mania. He has said he did not set out to help stoke the GameStop frenzy and instead believed that the stock was an attractive opportunity for investors. \u201cThe idea that I used social media to promote GameStop stock to unwitting investors is preposterous,\u201d Gill said in written testimony.\u00a0\u201cI was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only. \u2026 Whether other individual investors bought the stock was irrelevant to my thesis.\u201d Gill also said that he first purchased GameStop stock, and later call options, in the summer of 2019, when the stock was trading around $5 apiece. He added to his position through the rest of the year and 2020, and testified that he believed \u201cthe market remains oblivious to GameStop\u2019s unique opportunity.\u201d But even he didn\u2019t believe it would hit a high of $483 a share in 2021. \u201cAt the time I thought it was possible but a very low probability,\u201d Gill testified. Gill was a main character in the 2023 movie \u201cDumb Money\u201d (played by actor Paul Dano), which portrays the events leading up to and during the GameStop short squeeze.

{"id": "2024_05_17_business_uaw-mercedes-benz-rejected", "text": "Autoworkers at a Mercedes Benz plant in Alabama voted against joining the United Auto Workers union Friday, potentially stalling hopes of a rapidly growing organizing wave for autoworkers in the southern United States. The result was a close outcome. Out of the valid votes counted, 56% of workers voted \u201cno,\u201d while 44% voted \u201cyes\u201d for unionization, according to Mercedes-Benz. The National Labor Relations Board said Friday there were more than 5,000 eligible voters. The UAW was hoping to carry its strong momentum with the Alabama vote, as its decision to use a\u00a0\u201cstand up strike\u201d strategy,\u00a0hitting the Big Three automakers all at once, brought unprecedented attention and record contracts for workers. And last month, it won a union election at a\u00a0Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, its first victory in three attempts to organize the factory. Under relatively new UAW president Shawn Fain, the UAW had shifted its strategy for a membership push in non-unionized factories, many of which are located in the American South. In a March interview with Car and Driver, Fain said the profit margins for the Japanese, Korean and German automakers\u00a0were \u201cobscenely more gross than they were at the Big Three, and yet their workers get less.\u201d \u201cI truly believe we\u2019re going to see a huge shift this year. I think we\u2019re gonna win in the South,\u201d\u00a0he said in the interview. In a press conference Friday, however, Fain said that losses are part of the process and that the union will \u201ccarry on and keep on fighting.\u201d \u201cNot the result we wanted today, but I\u2019m very proud of these workers. We keep our heads up and we march on,\u201d Fain said. In an emailed statement Friday, Fain said the Alabama workers \u201cwon serious gains in this campaign.\u201d Fain said they raised wages with the \u201cUAW bump,\u201d which is when non-union companies gave non-unionized employees raises to compete with union contracts. Mercedes-Benz also named a new Alabama CEO ahead of the election. Fain said Mercedes encouraged workers to give the new CEO a chance before elections. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what Volkswagen told its workers in 2019. And in 2024, Volkswagen workers realized it\u2019s not about a CEO. It\u2019s about a voice on the job, it\u2019s about getting our lives back, and getting our time back. The only path to do that is through a union contract,\u201d he wrote. In a statement, Mercedes-Benz US International said that \u201cour goal throughout this process was to ensure every eligible Team Member had the opportunity to participate in a fair election.\u201d \u201cAt MBUSI, our primary focus is always to provide a safe and supportive work environment for our Team Members, so they can build superior vehicles for the world. We look forward to continuing to work directly with our Team Members to ensure MBUSI is not only their employer of choice, but a place they would recommend to friends and family,\u201d the statement continued. Workers faced pressure Six southern governors from Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas issued\u00a0a joint statement in April discouraging the union campaign, warning it could put workers\u2019 jobs, as well as the auto industry in the South, in jeopardy. The statement came a day before workers at Volkswagen voted on joining the UAW. \u201cThe reality is companies have choices when it comes to where to invest and bring jobs and opportunity. We have worked tirelessly on behalf of our constituents to bring good-paying jobs to our states. These jobs have become part of the fabric of the automotive manufacturing industry,\u201d the statement\u00a0said. In a statement Friday, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said that \u201cautomotive manufacturing is one of Alabama\u2019s crown jewel industries\u201d and that the state is \u201ccommitted to keeping it that way.\u201d \u201cThe workers in Vance have spoken, and they have spoken clearly! Alabama is not Michigan, and we are not the Sweet Home to the UAW,\u201d Ivey said in the statement. Mercedes allegedly pushed back against unionization efforts in other ways, according to the UAW. The National Labor Relations Board said it is investigating six unfair labor practice allegations filed by the UAW against Mercedes-Benz since March. Those accusations from the UAW allege Mercedes disciplined employees for discussing unionization during work, prohibited distribution of union materials, surveilled employees, and forced employees to attend \u201ccaptive audience meetings,\u201d which is a mandatory meeting during work hours meant to discourage unionizing. Mercedes-Benz US International denied these claims, and said in a statement it \u201chas not interfered with or retaliated against any Team Member in their right to pursue union representation.\u201d It continued, \u201cWe do not believe these claims have merit and we look forward to presenting our case to the NLRB.\u201d Organizing the South The UAW\u00a0said it began an effort to organize workers at 13 non-union auto US factories in November 2023. The effort included three US-based electric vehicle makers \u2014 Tesla, Rivian and Lucid \u2014 as well as 10 foreign automakers that build cars in the US \u2014 BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Mercedes, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Volvo. The South has been an attractive region for foreign automakers to open plants because of generous tax breaks and cheaper, non-union labor that generally doesn\u2019t receive the wages or benefits won by unionized workers. But last month, hourly workers at Volkswagen\u2019s plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, overwhelmingly voted to join the UAW \u2014 73% of the 3,600 workers at the plant who cast ballots had voted to join the union. The Chattanooga victory didn\u2019t come easy for the UAW. Volkswagen didn\u2019t win until its third union drive, said Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at\u00a0Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations\u2019 Buffalo office. This was the Mercedes plant\u2019s first strong push, and labor experts say a loss at Mercedes isn\u2019t the end of the push to organize the South. \u201cIt\u2019s not a catastrophe if they don\u2019t win (the first time). Primarily because they\u2019re facing a very active Mercedes Benz trying to block them from organizing, you got governors in the South trying to block them from organizing, and they don\u2019t have the same track record or history or infrastructure in Alabama,\u201d Wheaton said to CNN earlier this week. In a press conference Friday, Fain said the difference between Mercedes and Volkswagen was that \u201cVolkswagen was more neutral.\u201d \u201cUntil we can have an absolute, neutral, free and fair election\u2026 This is the fight we have to take on,\u201d Fain said. There are about 150,000 workers at nonunion auto plants in the United States today. That\u2019s roughly the same amount of workers represented at the Big Three. Since 1990, the South\u2019s share of auto jobs has doubled from around 15% to 30% today, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Meanwhile, the Midwest\u2019s share has declined from 60% to 45%. \u201cIt\u2019s not horrible if they lose, because it gives the UAW\u00a0the chance to see where they\u2019re at. They can gauge how much support they have,\u201d Wheaton said. This story has been updated with additional developments and context. - CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore and Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_16_business_royal-mail-takeover-daniel-kretinsky", "text": "Royal Mail dates back to the Tudors. It has been operating a postal service in England since the reign of Henry VIII. Now this most British of institutions is on the brink of being sold to a Czech billionaire, Daniel K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd, raising fears about the fate of thousands of workers and a key national service. British logistics company International Distribution Services (IDS), which owns the loss-making postal service, said Wednesday that it was \u201cminded to recommend\u201d to its shareholders a \u00a33.70-per-share ($4.69) takeover offer from K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd\u2019s EP Group. EP Group has until May 29 to convert its \u00a33.5 billion ($4.4 billion) non-biding offer into a formal bid for IDS. The likely sale would come after a difficult few years for Royal Mail, which was privatized in 2013. It has suffered a sharp drop in demand for its services, and losses have ballooned. Appeals to the government to be released from its obligation to deliver letters six days a week have fallen on deaf ears. A spokesperson for the UK Department for Business and Trade told CNN that it had \u201cno current plans\u201d to change Royal Mail\u2019s legally binding service obligations. \u201cAny future changes to Royal Mail\u2019s operation will need to take into account the impacts on businesses and vulnerable consumers who rely on this vital service,\u201d the spokesperson said. So who is the white knight ready to take on a company that, during the last financial year, was losing \u00a38 million ($10 million) a week? The \u2018Czech Sphinx\u2019 K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd is a Czech national who has made his fortune through a sprawling empire of European energy companies, retailers and football clubs. He is worth an estimated $7.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The 49-year-old magnate began his career as a lawyer, before moving to a Czech investment bank, where he became a partner in 2003, according to EP Group\u2019s website. A few years later, K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd co-founded Energetick\u00fd a pr\u016fmyslov\u00fd holding, or EPH, which owns European gas- and coal-fired power plants, commodities trading firms and freight companies, its website shows. In 2016, the billionaire founded EP Group with business partner Patrik Tk\u00e1\u010d. Through its investment arm Vesa Equity Investment, K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd has acquired stakes in big-name brands such as Foot Locker (FL) in the United States, FNAC in France, and supermarket Sainsbury\u2019s in the United Kingdom. He has come to be known as a mysterious personality given his reluctance to speak publicly about his business dealings. So elusive, in fact, that the Polish version of Newsweek magazine dubbed him the \u201cCzech Sphinx\u201d in 2019. The Sphinx, a mythical creature originating in Greek mythology, requires travelers to solve a riddle before allowing them to pass. But some fans of British soccer will already know his name. Three years ago, the businessman bought a 27% stake in West Ham United Football Club through another of his investment firms. That makes K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd the club\u2019s second-biggest shareholder, according its website. \u2018As British as it gets\u2019 The potential buyout of Royal Mail has stirred anxieties about the consequences of the iconic British institution coming under foreign ownership. \u201cAs a rule, we welcome international investment in British companies,\u201d UK finance minister Jeremy Hunt told reporters Friday. \u201cBut we do always look at national security considerations and make sure that, in terms of our core infrastructure, there are no risks to those going forward, and any bid for Royal Mail would go through that normal process.\u201d Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, which represents about 110,000 Royal Mail workers, said the potential takeover by K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd\u2019s investment firm posed a \u201cthreat\u201d to the future of postal services in the UK. He asked that EP Group \u201cimmediately demonstrate\u201d a commitment to working with the CWU and rule out any potential break-up of Royal Mail or diminishment of its workers\u2019 pension pots. \u201cIt cannot be right that a key part of national infrastructure is allowed to be owned by individuals or companies who have no vision for the future and no clear plan to put the workforce at the heart of turning Royal Mail around,\u201d Ward said in a statement Wednesday. Jonathan Reynolds, business spokesperson for the UK\u2019s opposition Labour Party, urged EP Group in a letter to provide \u201ccast-iron guarantees\u201d that it would keep Royal Mail\u2019s headquarters in the UK, and would work closely with its labor union. \u201cRoyal Mail is as British as it gets, and Labour will take the necessary steps to safeguard its undeniable identity and place in public life,\u201d he wrote in the letter, which he posted on X. In a statement last month, EP Group said it was \u201ca committed long-term investor in the UK\u201d and believed that private investment in Royal Mail was \u201ccrucial\u201d as the service faced escalating competition with multinational companies in the UK postal market. \u201cRoyal Mail is an important national asset that would benefit from being able to take a longer-term view,\u201d the firm said. \u201c(EP Group) is prepared to support this iconic business as it transforms and rebuilds into a modern postal operator delivering high-quality service to its customers, stability to its workforce and sustainable financial performance.\u201d Ivana Kottasov\u00e1 contributed reporting.
