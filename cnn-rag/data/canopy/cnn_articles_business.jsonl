The company had worked with IBM to develop and test AI-driven, voice-automated ordering at some of its restaurants. The fast food giant says it\u2019s still working on AI-related solutions at a time when its rivals are making similar investments. It plans to shut off the technology in restaurants participating in the test \u201cno later than July 26, 2024,\u201d according to reporting from trade publication Restaurant Business. \u201cIBM remains a trusted partner and we will still utilize many of their products across our global System,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said in an email sent to franchisees and shared with CNN. But the company suggested it will look at AI partners other than IBM. McDonald\u2019s and IBM launched their partnership in 2021, announcing the development of Automated Order Taking (AOT) technology to create a more convenient and simplified ordering experience for its customers and restaurant teams as a part of its \u201cAccelerating the Arches\u201d growth plan. IBM said the AOT\u00a0technology that emerged from the partnership has \u201csome of the most comprehensive capabilities in the industry, fast and accurate\u201d in\u00a0demanding conditions. \u201cWhile McDonald\u2019s is revaluating and refining its plans for AOT, we look forward to continuing to work with them on a variety of other projects,\u201d IBM said in a statement. McDonald\u2019s says this is not the end of\u00a0its AI efforts. It plans to\u00a0\u201cevaluate long-term, scalable solutions\u201d for voice-ordering by the end of 2024. \u201cAI is clearly going to be a part of restaurant automation and efficiencies going forward, but the technology is still in its infancy,\u201d said David Henkes, senior principal and head of strategic partnerships at Technomic. \u201cThe McDonald\u2019s experience and commitment to AI shows the potential upside, but it also shows the limitations of the technology at the present time.\u201d McDonald\u2019s is not the only fast-food chain experimenting with AI. Other companies like White Castle tested out an automated drive-thru ordering system in 2021, and Wendy\u2019s expanded its partnership with Google Cloud to roll out its own AI ordering tool in May last year. Despite fast-food companies\u2019 enthusiasm to integrate AI-powered solutions into their daily operations, the technology has still hit snags. Some customers have complained about AI getting their orders wrong \u2014 a result of the technology\u2019s inability to recognize some accents and distinguish the customer\u2019s voice from background noise.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/tech/mcdonalds-ai-drive-thru-program/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}

But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_economy_graceland-title-theft", "text": "Last month, a much-beloved piece of American history was nearly stolen \u2013 but not in a museum heist or a home burglary. Instead, self-proclaimed scammers used a fraudulent real estate scheme. In late May, Graceland, Elvis Presley\u2019s iconic Memphis home-turned-tourist-attraction, was nearly auctioned off when a company called Naussany Investments and Private Lending fraudulently said it had a claim to the house. A Tennessee judge ultimately stopped the sale. Experts say rental properties, vacation homes and homes where the owners are deceased can be targets of home title theft. However, despite the high-profile Graceland attempt, these types of scams are still relatively rare. Last year, there were a total of 9,521 reported real estate scams, including title theft, according to the FBI\u2019s annual Internet Crime Report \u2014 a number that has stayed relatively stable over the past five years. But these crimes have become easier than ever to execute, according to experts. Here are some ways to protect yourself: What is home title fraud? Home title fraud occurs when scammers impersonate homeowners to refinance or sell a victim\u2019s property and pocket the money. This type of fraud can be devastating and costly to resolve. The scheme can take many forms, but the internet and new technology have made it easier for crooks to carry out, said David Fleck, a real estate fraud attorney in Los Angeles. \u201cThe way we transfer ownership of property in this country is by signing a deed of some sort in front of a notary who verifies our identity. Then, that document is recorded by the recorder\u2019s officer or the clerk\u2019s office. Their job is to keep the official copy of the document forever,\u201d he said. But new technology has provided an opening for would-be thieves. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy to get a high-quality fake ID online,\u201d Fleck said. \u201cIt\u2019s also very easy to get a fake notary stamp online and literally every computer has the technology on it to create believable forged documents.\u201d In the case of Graceland last month, the purported scammer presented documents claiming to show that Lisa Marie Presley, the recently deceased daughter of Elvis and Priscilla Presley, had borrowed $3.8 million from Naussany Investments and used Graceland as collateral. Actress Riley Keough, Elvis Presley\u2019s granddaughter and the current owner of the property, sued to protect the estate from going to auction, alleging fraud and claiming Naussany had no right to the property. Naussany\u2019s documents apparently contained a Florida notary\u2019s forged signature, according to court records.  In a statement, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said his office was looking into the attempted foreclosure auction of Graceland. In an email associated with Naussany Investments to CNN, a self-proclaimed scammer claimed responsibility for the attempted home title fraud. \u201cI didn\u2019t win this one. I\u2019ve stole (sic) many identities and received monies, we don\u2019t win all,\u201d the email read. In a separate email to the New York Times, the alleged scammer wrote that they are based in Nigeria and mostly targeted homes belonging to the dead and elderly, especially in states like Florida and California. They used sensitive documents like birth certificates to facilitate their schemes, according to the Times article. Jeremy Miller, director of product and development at\u00a0Allstate\u00a0Identity Protection, said scammers are generally attracted to properties like rental homes or vacation homes. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a lot of documentation flying back and forth, some red flags might be missed,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWhen there might not be anybody living there, or it\u2019s a transient population, it\u2019s a bit easier for them to attack something like that.\u201d There isn\u2019t an easy fix for this type of fraud. Fleck said the best recourse is to file a lawsuit so that a court can decide who actually owns the property, which can be costly and time-consuming. \u201cOnce a fake deed is recorded, the only option for the true owner is to file a special kind of lawsuit called a quiet title action to get the court to figure out who actually owns the property,\u201d he said, estimating that the process often takes more than six months. How to protect yourself Fortunately, there are ways to thwart home title fraudsters before they list your home for sale or take out a new mortgage in your name. There has been a proliferation of commercials for home-deed monitoring services: If something unlawful happens, these services say they will notify you right away \u2014 for a cost. What these advertisements don\u2019t say is that many US counties offer deed monitoring services free of charge. Before you consider paying for a service, check to see your county\u2019s offerings, Fleck advises. Some states, like Georgia, have an opt-in text alert program that will notify you if there are any changes to your home title. Some homeowners may already be protected. A standard American Land Title Association (ALTA) homeowner\u2019s policy of title insurance covers home title forgery and impersonation. However, ALTA\u2019s similarly named owners policy of title insurance does not provide such coverage. Overall, said Miller, home title fraud is a form of identity theft, and homeowners should try to look out for anything \u201cthat seems a little off.\u201d  Miller warned that if a crook with your identity goes unchecked, they may try to perpetrate other fraudulent schemes in addition to home title theft. There are ways to try to spot an identity thief, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: Closely read credit card and bank statements and monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity to detect any signs of identity theft. \u201cIf it seems strange and it\u2019s related to your finances, or if it\u2019s a letter you get in the mail or an email from a company you don\u2019t recognize, take that extra step to make sure there\u2019s nothing that might be smoke signaling a larger fire,\u201d Miller said. \u201cA lot of times, early detection can help reduce risk.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/economy/graceland-title-theft/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_business_boeing-ceo-calhoun-testimony", "text": "Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun plans to apologize for Boeing\u2019s recent safety failures in Senate testimony Tuesday and admit to problems with the company culture, but he\u2019ll push back on whistleblower claims that the company retaliated against those who brought safety issues to light. \u201cMuch has been said about Boeing\u2019s culture. We\u2019ve heard those concerns loud and clear,\u201d he will say in prepared remarks released by Boeing Monday afternoon. \u201cOur culture is far from perfect, but we are taking action and making progress. We understand the gravity, and we are committed to moving forward.\u201d The \u201cfar from perfect\u201d remark is a massive understatement. Boeing has been under intense scrutiny with numerous federal investigations and congressional hearings since a January 5 Alaska Air Boeing 737 Max flight had a door plug blow off, leaving a gaping hole in both the plane and Boeing\u2019s reputation. Boeing has been ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration to improve its safety issues before it can resume normal production, causing problems for airlines that can\u2019t get the planes they ordered. And that, in turn, has meant higher fares for passengers, who have had their faith the company\u2019s planes sorely tested. The hearing Tuesday by the Senate\u2019s permanent subcommittee on investigations is entitled \u201cBoeing\u2019s broken safety culture.\u201d It is just the latest congressional hearing this year about safety issues at Boeing but the first time Calhoun is testifying in his more than four years running the troubled company. He will be joined by Howard McKenzie, Boeing\u2019s chief engineer. At an April 17 hearing Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour testified that Boeing is putting out defective planes because he and others who complain faced pressure not to do so. \u201cI have serious concerns about the safety of the 787 and 777 aircraft, and I\u2019m willing to take on professional risk to talk about them,\u201d Salehpour said in his opening statement. He said when he raised concerns, \u201cI was ignored. I was told not to create delays. I was told, frankly, to shut up.\u201d Calhoun denies that is the case currently at Boeing in his prepared remarks. \u201cWe are committed to making sure every employee feels empowered to speak up if there is a problem,\u201d he\u2019ll say, according to the prepared remarks. \u201cWe also have strict policies in place to prohibit retaliation against employees who come forward. It is our job to listen, regardless of how we obtain feedback, and handle it with the seriousness it deserves.\u201d Will there be changes? Despite the attention the hearing is expected to garner, it\u2019s unlikely to produce significant change at the company, said Richard Aboulafia, managing partner for AeroDynamic Consultancy, an aerospace advisory firm. \u201cNothing has produced change (at Boeing) except frustration from a bunch of airline customers,\u201d said Aboulafia. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what will change as a consequence of this. He (Calhoun) needs to go. He has shown a strong desire to double down on what\u2019s bad.\u201d A preliminary investigation of the Alaska Air incident has found that the plane left a Boeing factory two months before the incident without the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place. And Boeing has yet to produce the paperwork to identify who in the factory installed the door plug without the bolts. It has been harshly criticized by members of Congress and safety regulators and will likely face more criticism Tuesday. Calhoun has already met with members of Congress since the Alaska Air incident, albeit behind closed doors. He has also made numerous public statements to Boeing employees and to investors since the Alaska Air incident. \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that,\u201d he told investors in January during a call after reporting its fifth straight annual loss. \u201cWhatever conclusions (from the investigations) are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better.\u201d Apologies to families, passengers Calhoun\u2019s prepared remarks begin with an apology to the family members of the victims of two fatal 737 Max crashes. Some of those family members plan to attend the hearing. Between them, 346 people were killed in the 2018 and 2019 crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, leading to to a 20-month grounding of the jet to fix a design flaw that caused the crashes. \u201cWe are deeply sorry for your losses,\u201d he\u2019ll say in his opening comments. \u201cNothing is more important than the safety of the people who step on board our airplanes. Every day we seek to honor the memory of those lost.\u201d He also plans to again apologize to the passengers and crew of the Alaska Air flight in January. \u201cWe deeply regret the impact that the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 accident had on Alaska Airlines\u2019 team and its passengers, and we are grateful to the pilots and crew for safely landing the plane,\u201d he\u2019ll say. \u201cWe are thankful that there were no fatalities.\u201d But experts say that it was sheer luck that no one was killed in the Alaska Air incident. This could very well be Calhoun\u2019s only time testifying on Capitol Hill. He has announced plans to retire before the end of this year. His successor has yet to be selected. Beyond Tuesday\u2019s hearing, and the numerous federal investigations it faces, the company could still face criminal liability from the original certification process of the 737 Max. In January of 2021 Boeing agreed to a probationary period, which deferred any prosecution on those charges and which would have exempted it from criminal liability in the crashes. But the January 5 incident aboard the Alaska Air flight happened just days before the end of the probationary period. In May the Justice Department notified Boeing that it was now subject to criminal prosecution. Boeing has denied the Alaska Air incident violated the deferred prosecution agreement and is challenging any potential criminal liability in court. The family members planning to attend Tuesday\u2019s hearing say they want to see Boeing prosecuted criminally.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/business/boeing-ceo-calhoun-testimony/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_media_jeff-bezos-will-lewis-washington-post", "text": "Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of The Washington Post, broke his silence Tuesday on the mounting turmoil within his newspaper, expressing support for maintaining high standards at the storied publication as questions swirl over the ethical integrity of its new publisher, Will Lewis. \u201cI know you\u2019ve already heard this from Will, but I wanted to also weigh in directly: the journalistic standards and ethics at The Post will not change,\u201d Bezos said in an email to top newsroom leaders, signaling support for Lewis, though not explicitly. Bezos added in the memo, which was obtained by CNN, that \u201cit can\u2019t be business as usual\u201d at The Post, which has been plagued by financial and audience woes. \u201cThe world is evolving rapidly and we do need to change as a business. With your support, we\u2019ll do that and lead this great institution into the future,\u201d Bezos wrote. \u201cBut, as the newsroom leaders who\u2019ve been shaping and guiding our coverage, you also know our standards at The Post have always been very high. That can\u2019t change \u2014 and it won\u2019t.\u201d \u201cYou have my full commitment on maintaining the quality, ethics, and standards we all believe in,\u201d Bezos added. The memo to The Post\u2019s top personnel comes after serious questions were raised about Lewis, who has been the subject of several explosive reports in recent days that raise questions over whether he is committed to the newspaper\u2019s rigorous journalistic standards. The New York Times\u00a0reported over the weekend\u00a0that, in his Fleet Street days, Lewis assigned an article that was based on stolen phone records. And The Post itself reported in a 3,000-word\u00a0front page story\u00a0Sunday that a \u201cthief\u201d who used deceptive tactics to obtain private material had ties with Lewis\u2019 hand-picked incoming top editor, Robert Winnett. The stories, which landed like a one-two punch in The Post\u2019s newsroom, followed reports that Lewis tried to suppress stories at The Post and NPR about his role cleaning up Rupert Murdoch\u2019s UK phone hacking scandal, when he served as a lieutenant to the right-wing media mogul. Instead of deescalating the situation, Lewis initially lashed out, going so far as to criticize his own media reporters and launch an on-the-record attack aimed at the well-respected NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik, who he referred to as an \u201cactivist, not a journalist.\u201d Lewis later sent a memo to staffers, striking a notably different, non-confrontational tone. But the note did not quell the growing anger within The Post. Inside The Post\u2019s newsroom, morale has plunged in recent months as alarmed staffers express frustration over Lewis\u2019 conduct and worries over the future direction of the newspaper under his leadership. Interviews with nearly a dozen Post staffers and others familiar with the internal dynamics of the newspaper this week revealed a workforce that has grown increasingly dismayed by the situation, with some searching for work elsewhere. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the professor and senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, told CNN on Monday that Bezos should dismiss Lewis. Sonnenfeld, who has advised US presidents and scores of corporate leaders, said that if he were advising Bezos, he would tell him Lewis has \u201clost legitimacy to lead\u201d and it\u2019s time to \u201cclean the house.\u201d \u201cThis is a tragic meltdown of the conscience of American journalism bringing shame to the Katharine Graham, Ben Bradlee, Marty Baron legacy of collaboration, courage, and integrity,\u201d Sonnenfeld said. \u201cBezos must recruit an accomplished, experienced editor whom journalists admire and trust.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/media/jeff-bezos-will-lewis-washington-post/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security", "text": "The Federal Trade Commission is investigating TikTok for its data and security practices, two sources told CNN on the condition of anonymity. The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}

The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before.

According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_investing_electric-car-maker-fisker-bankruptcy", "text": "Fisker, a US electric vehicle startup, said Tuesday it had filed for bankruptcy. The company had already warned it was in trouble. When it published quarterly earnings in February, it said it might not have enough money to survive another year. Fisker added then that it was in discussions with an existing investor about possibly putting more money into the company. On Tuesday, a Fisker spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cLike other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we have faced various market and macroeconomic headwinds that have impacted our ability to operate efficiently.\u201d While growth in global EV sales is slowing, Fisker has also grappled with its own problems. Its sole product is the Fisker Ocean electric SUV. Last year, around 10,000 of the SUVs were made but only about half had been delivered to customers, the company said in its earnings report in February. The Ocean was also the subject of a review that month by American YouTuber Marques Brownlee titled, \u201cThis is the Worst Car I\u2019ve Ever Reviewed.\u201d \u201cDo not buy this version of the Fisker Ocean,\u201d reads the video\u2019s description. The video, which sent Fisker\u2019s stock plunging after its release, has racked up 5.7 million views so far. In a recent\u00a0interview with Automotive News,\u00a0the company\u2019s founder and CEO Henrik Fisker admitted that the Ocean had quality problems. He blamed the issues on software from different suppliers that worked poorly together and said they were being addressed through updates. Besides its own troubles, Fisker has had to deal with a jump in competition from established automakers since the company was established in 2016. Now, besides Tesla, heavyweights like Hyundai, Kia, Ford and General Motors offer electric SUVs that are similar to the Ocean but without the risks of dealing with an unknown startup. And China\u2019s BYD has soared to challenge Tesla as the global market leader in EVs. Still, Fisker\u2019s bankruptcy is another sign of the broader headwinds and speed bumps facing the burgeoning EV industry. Worldwide sales of plug-in vehicles could rise 21% this year, according to recent forecasts by the International Energy Agency. While significant, that\u2019s a smaller rise than the 35% increase in 2023. In the United States and Europe, one barrier to faster adoption of electric cars is their higher average price compared with new conventional cars. Another is a lack of public charging infrastructure. Fisker filed for bankruptcy Monday, choosing the common Chapter 11 route, which allows companies to try to resolve their financial problems through reorganization. The startup said Tuesday that it was in \u201cadvanced discussions with financial stakeholders\u201d about the sale of its assets. Fisker had also previously said it was in rescue talks with a major established automaker but that those talks had fallen apart without a deal.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/investing/electric-car-maker-fisker-bankruptcy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_tech_apple-ai-data-openai-artificial-intelligence", "text": "Apple\u2019s splashy announcement at its Worldwide Developers Conference this week that it\u2019s adding artificial intelligence to its products, and partnering with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has raised many questions about how Apple\u2019s AI offerings will work. The confusion is understandable. Apple is simultaneously launching a proprietary suite of AI models while also integrating ChatGPT into its devices and software. So it\u2019s natural to wonder where one ends and the other begins and \u2014 perhaps more pressingly \u2014 what both companies will do with the personal information they receive from users. The stakes are particularly high for Apple, a company that has made security and privacy a hallmark of its brand. Here\u2019s what we know. The difference between Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT If Apple has its own AI, why does it need ChatGPT? The answer is that each is meant to do different things. Apple Intelligence \u2014 the collective brand name for all of Apple\u2019s own AI tools \u2014 is intended to be more of a personal assistant than anything else, with an emphasis on \u201cpersonal.\u201d It takes in specific information about your relationships and contacts, messages and emails you\u2019ve sent, events you\u2019ve been to, meetings on your calendar and other highly individualized bits of data about your life. And then it uses that data to, Apple hopes, make your life a little easier \u2014 helping you dig up a photo you took from that concert years ago, finding the right attachment to put on an email, or ranking your mobile notifications by priority and urgency. But while Apple Intelligence might know that you went on a hiking trip last year, it will lack what company executives called \u201cworld knowledge\u201d \u2014 more general information about history, current events and other things that are less directly linked to you. That\u2019s where ChatGPT comes in. Users will be able to have Siri forward questions and prompts to ChatGPT \u2014\u00a0on an opt-in basis \u2014 or have ChatGPT help you write documents within Apple apps. Apple said it plans to integrate with other third-party AI models eventually, too. The integration essentially removes a step to accessing ChatGPT and gives Apple users a more seamless onramp to that platform. What does this mean for my data? Since Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT will be used for largely different purposes, the amount and type of information users send to each AI may be different, too. Apple Intelligence will have access to a wide range of your personal data, from your written communications to photos and videos you\u2019ve taken to a record of your calendar events. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to prevent Apple Intelligence from accessing this information, short of not using its features; an Apple spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately respond to questions on that topic. ChatGPT won\u2019t necessarily or automatically have access to your highly personal details, although you might choose to share some of this data and more with OpenAI if you decide to use ChatGPT through Apple. In Monday\u2019s demo, Apple showed Siri asking the user for permission to send a prompt to ChatGPT before doing so. As part of its agreement with Apple, OpenAI made an important concession: OpenAI agreed not to store any prompts from Apple users or to collect their IP addresses \u2014 though all bets are off if you consciously decide to log in and connect an existing ChatGPT account. Some users might\u00a0choose to do\u00a0that\u00a0to take advantage of their ChatGPT history or the benefits associated with ChatGPT\u2019s paid account plans. Should you trust Apple with your data? Now that we\u2019ve established what OpenAI will and won\u2019t do with your data, what about Apple? While Apple users will have to send their personal information and AI queries to OpenAI if they want to use ChatGPT, Apple has said that most of the time Apple Intelligence won\u2019t be sending user data anywhere. As much as possible, Apple will try to process AI prompts directly on your device using smaller AI models. This is similar to how Apple already processes FaceID and other sensitive data \u2014 the idea being that processing data right on the device limits risky exposure. Your data can\u2019t be intercepted or hacked from a central server if it never actually goes anywhere. In the event your AI task needs more processing power, Apple Intelligence will send your query and data to a cloud computing platform controlled by Apple, where a more capable AI model will fulfill the request. This is where Apple claims it has achieved a major privacy breakthrough. The company\u2019s announcement received relatively little airtime during its jam-packed Monday keynote but the company is plainly proud of the advancement it\u2019s clearly been extensively planning. Apple said Monday it has developed a new way to do cloud computing that means Apple can run computations on sensitive data while ensuring that nobody, not even the company itself, can tell what data is being processed or what computation is being done. Known as Private Cloud Compute, Apple\u2019s new architecture borrows certain hardware and security concepts from the iPhone, including the secure enclave that already protects sensitive user data on Apple mobile devices. With Private Cloud Compute, \u201cyour data is never stored or made accessible to Apple,\u201d said Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s SVP of software engineering, during Monday\u2019s keynote. After fulfilling a user\u2019s AI request, Private Cloud Compute scrubs itself of any user data involved in the process, Apple said. Apple claims Private Cloud Compute\u00a0is \u201conly possible\u201d because of the tight control it has over its entire technology ecosystem \u2014 from the specialized, proprietary computer chips to the software tying everything together. If it\u2019s true that Apple can\u2019t see the personal data that its large AI models are crunching \u2014 a claim Apple invited researchers to test for themselves because the system\u2019s design is meant to be scrutinized \u2014 then that sets Apple\u2019s implementation apart from that of other companies. For example, when you use ChatGPT, OpenAI discloses that it uses your data to further train its AI models. With Private Cloud Compute, you theoretically won\u2019t have to take Apple\u2019s word that it doesn\u2019t use your data for AI training. What about Apple\u2019s training data? Apple\u2019s AI models didn\u2019t spring up out of nowhere. They had to be trained, too, just like models offered by other companies. And that raises questions about whose data Apple used, and how. In a technical document released this week, Apple said its models are trained \u201con licensed data, including data selected to enhance specific features.\u201d \u201cWe never use our users\u2019 private personal data or user interactions when training our foundation models,\u201d the company added, \u201cand we apply filters to remove personally identifiable information like social security and credit card numbers that are publicly available on the Internet.\u201d Apple did, however, admit to scraping the public internet for data that then went into training its proprietary models, making it somewhat similar to other AI companies, some of whom have faced copyright lawsuits and sparked a debate over whether AI startups have unfairly profited off the work of humans.

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can \u201clisten\u201d to people\u2019s questions and converse in real time. \u201cShellie\u201d can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while \u201cArif\u201d is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_economy_us-retail-sales-may", "text": "Sales at US retailers rose last month at an unexpectedly weak pace as Americans continue to deal with still-high inflation and elevated interest rates. Retail sales rose just 0.1% in May from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. That\u2019s better than April\u2019s downwardly revised 0.2% decline but below the 0.3% gain economists projected in a FactSet poll. The figures are adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation. Sales declined the most at gas stations, down 2.2% in May. Excluding that, sales were up by 0.3% last month. American shoppers also pulled back on purchases at furniture stores (-1.1%) and shops that sell building materials and garden equipment (-0.8%). Meanwhile, spending was the strongest at specialty stores that sell sporting goods, books, and musical instruments, which jumped by 2.8% last month. Monthly retail sales have increased four times over the past six months through May, but figures for April and March were revised lower, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Inflation is down from the 40-year highs of two years ago, but it remains elevated. Meanwhile, interest rates are at their highest in nearly a quarter century after the Federal Reserve launched an aggressive rate-hiking campaign in 2022 to rein in price hikes. Household savings accumulated during the Covid-19 pandemic are dwindling, and may have already been exhausted. A slowing economy help builds a case for the Fed to begin cutting interest rates \u2014 if it\u2019s accompanied by inflation also easing. \u201cSpending is cooling back towards a more sustainable pace,\u201d Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, told CNN\u2019s Matt Egan in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s important we don\u2019t confuse a slower pace of spending with the economy turning over, because that\u2019s clearly not happening.\u201d \u201cTo be honest with you, this is a big relief for policymakers at the Fed,\u201d he added. Shoppers are fatigued Evidence is starting to mount that US consumers are pulling back as they face tough economic hurdles. Retailers such as Walmart, Kohl\u2019s and Target have said that shoppers are feeling pinched and are starting to cut back. While lower-income Americans were already struggling, the pain has now spread to middle-income consumers. \u201cOur customers continue to be pressured by a number of economic factors, including high interest rates and inflation,\u201d Kohl\u2019s CEO Thomas Kingsbury said in an earnings call earlier this month. \u201cOur middle income customer continues to be impacted.\u201d There are signs that even wealthier shoppers are feeling strained. Walmart, America\u2019s largest retailer, said higher-income consumers have been flocking to its stores in search of bargains. High-end retailers have also sounded the alarm of a broad and ongoing slowdown in luxury spending. But at the same time, spending on travel and other in-person experiences such as concerts is expected to be robust this summer. The Commerce Department releases broader consumer spending figures for May, which include services, later this month. Tuesday\u2019s retail sales report only captures spending on goods and food services. What it means for the Fed Weaker-than-expected spending over the past few months helps set the stage for the Fed to begin lowering borrowing costs sometime this year. The figures provide some evidence that the US economy isn\u2019t overheating and is instead slowing. It hasn\u2019t just been spending figures that have come in soft recently. Economic data for April and May showed that inflation began to moderate again after stalling in the first three months of the year. The latest Consumer Price Index, released last week, showed that prices held flat in May on a monthly basis for the first time since July 2022. From a year earlier, consumer prices were up 3.3% in May, slowing from April\u2019s 3.4% rate. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said this week that the latest CPI was \u201cvery welcome\u201d and that the Fed\u2019s latest economic projections reflecting just one rate cut this year make sense. \u201cIn my view, this calls for a cautious approach,\u201d said Harker, who doesn\u2019t vote on policy moves this year, during an event Monday. \u201cIf we start to see several months of where we\u2019re seeing data move in the right direction, I could see taking action. But I\u2019m not there right now.\u201d The timing of the Fed\u2019s first rate cut this cycle will be primarily determined by what\u2019s going on with inflation, but officials say they look at what\u2019s happening economy wide. The first cut will be a consequential decision, because inflation could heat back up if central bank officials cut too soon \u2014 or the economy could slip into a recession if they cut too late.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/economy/us-retail-sales-may/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}

Nationwide Pet, the country\u2019s largest provider of pet insurance, says it is dropping about 100,000 policies between now and next summer to keep up with spiraling costs in vet care. The move comes as other types of insurance, from homeowners to vehicles, are increasingly becoming harder to obtain for many Americans. \u201cInflation in the cost of veterinary care and other factors have led to recent underwriting changes and the withdrawal of some products in some states \u2014 difficult actions that are necessary to ensure a financially sustainable future for our pet insurance line of business,\u201d Nationwide said in an announcement last week.

{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_cars_eu-ev-tariffs-china-effects-analysis-intl-hnk", "text": "After months of investigation, the European Union has announced additional tariffs on electric vehicles (EV) imported from China, because of what it sees as Beijing\u2019s unfair support for companies that undercut European carmakers. The decision deals a blow to the Chinese government, which had been lobbying hard against the taxes, and EV producers in the country. Most companies are facing hefty extra tariffs of between 17.4% and 38.1%, on top of the 10% duty already levied by the bloc. The impact on China\u2019s EV makers will vary depending on the level of tariff and each company\u2019s cost structure. Those hardest hit may be forced to raise prices or set up factories in Europe. And while Beijing is clearly unhappy,\u00a0analysts say it\u2019s unlikely to want to rush into a full-blown trade war with its\u00a0second biggest trading partner, not least because of economic pressures at home. For market leader BYD, which vies with Tesla as the world\u2019s top producer of battery electric vehicles, there\u2019s still space for it to grow in Europe, even with the additional duty, according to Gregor Sebastian, a senior analyst with the Rhodium Group. Facing the lowest additional levy of 17.4%, BYD could emerge as a relative \u201cwinner,\u201d he said. Duties at this level could even allow BYD to cut its already competitive prices to gain market share in Europe. \u201cBYD is already building a factory in Europe, is likely to still profitably export to the EU even with 17% duties, and can export plug-in hybrids without additional duties,\u201d Sebastian said. The new tariffs only target battery EVs. Rhodium said in April that BYD\u2019s European profits are 45% higher than in China, meaning that market will still remain highly attractive even after the new tariffs are imposed. China\u2019s top market Europe is key to Beijing\u2019s EV ambitions. It overtook Asia as China\u2019s largest EV export market in 2021. That helped propel China into pole position as the world\u2019s No 1 car exporter. \u201cOne critical issue for China is that the EU accounted for 38% of China\u2019s EV exports in 2023,\u201d Sebastian said. \u201cChina will not be able to reroute exports to other countries as potential alternatives like Brazil, Turkey and the US have also pulled up drawbridges.\u201d Last month, the United States quadrupled tariffs on EVs from China, from 25% to 100%, aiming to boost American jobs and manufacturing. \u201cThe EU is the only market left that is both wealthy and large enough to absorb a meaningful amount of China\u2019s excess production of EVs,\u201d said Etienne Soula, a research analyst with Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. The Chinese government has big dreams for the country\u2019s EV industry, part of a broader strategy to surpass America in the global tech race. It\u2019s also trying to counter a property-induced economic slowdown and promote a low-carbon economy. EVs, along with photovoltaics and lithium-ion batteries, are seen by the government as the \u201cnew three\u201d growth drivers that will play a pivotal role in shaping the country\u2019s economic landscape. In February, nine government agencies, including the Commerce Ministry and the central bank, vowed to provide support to accelerate Chinese EV makers\u2019 global push. Tesla prices to rise In contrast to BYD, state-owned carmaker SAIC is in a \u201cdisastrous\u201d situation facing 38.1% in additional tariffs, according to Sebastian. EV sales in the EU accounted for 15% of the company\u2019s total sales in 2023 and early 2024.\u00a0The Shanghai-based automaker, which was China\u2019s second largest seller of battery EVs, pug-in hybrids and fuel cell cars (NEVs) last year, will likely need to build a factory in Europe to bypass these duties. Geely, China\u2019s fourth largest NEV retailer and the owner of Volvo, faces 20% in additional duties, a penalty which is likely to be a \u201cmixed bag,\u201d Sebastian said. His analysis suggests Geely could still profitably export to the EU, but margins will narrow severely. For Tesla (TSLA), which uses China as its base for global exports including to Europe, the situation is also tricky. The European Commission said Wednesday that the EV giant may receive an individually calculated duty rate at a future stage following a request by the carmaker. In a message posted to its website in several European countries Thursday, Tesla said it expected to have to raise prices for its Model 3 from July 1 because of the new tariffs. Sebastian said additional duties above 21% would likely render Tesla\u2019s exports from China to the EU uncompetitive. Localization coming The EU\u2019s move is likely to hasten efforts by Chinese carmakers to set up factories in the region. The \u201cannouncement is more likely to accelerate the extent to which Chinese [EV companies] and suppliers manufacture their products within Europe, something that we have already started to see,\u201d said Andrew Bergbaum, global co-head of AlixPartners\u2019\u00a0automotive & industrial practice. BYD announced in December that it would build an EV factory in Hungary, becoming the first major Chinese automaker to build passenger cars in Europe. While the tariffs would not be good news for consumers and cities with zero emission needs, \u201cthe establishment of new European-manufactured electric vehicles by Chinese companies would certainly be welcomed,\u201d said Bergbaum. However, it also means there will be more competition in a sector that already has too much capacity, leading to large scale disruptions of existing manufacturing sites as they \u201crebalance their resources\u201d, he added. UBS analysts, meanwhile, predicted on Wednesday that the number of Chinese manufacturers making inroads in the EU would become \u201cmore concentrated.\u201d Smaller players may become discouraged and give up, even as Chinese industry leaders press ahead. But they also expected Chinese companies to accelerate the location of assembly plants in the EU, a move which would be welcomed by EU member states like Hungry, Italy, and Spain. Too much to lose Ahead of the announcement, Beijing had dropped hints that it could retaliate. Its ministries of commerce and foreign ministries each reiterated Wednesday that China would take \u201call necessary measures\u201d to defend its interests. Analysts, though, don\u2019t believe there is a high chance of serious escalation. \u201cThe situation is unlikely to develop into a full-blown trade war, both sides have too much to lose,\u201d Sebastian said. Soula said China could retaliate by imposing tariffs on some European goods such as luxury cars, premium brandies or airplane parts. But given the economic pressures that China is already under, it has \u201climited room\u201d for maneuver when responding to the EU. Also, \u201cthere is still the possibility of (EU) countries who are skeptical of this investigation coming together to diminish the final level of the tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this context, China may want to wait before going all out to avoid hardening attitudes in those member states.\u201d Currently provisional, the tariffs are due to be introduced on July 4 if discussions with Chinese authorities don\u2019t lead to a mutual agreement.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/cars/eu-ev-tariffs-china-effects-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}

Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_business_faa-boeing-oversight-too-hands-off", "text": "Federal Aviation Administration chief Mike Whitaker said his agency is partly responsible for the safety problems at Boeing, admitting that it had been \u201ctoo hands off\u201d in its oversight of the troubled aircraft manufacturer. In testimony Thursday before the Senate Commerce Committee, Whitaker said that his agency now had far more inspectors on the ground at Boeing factories and the factory of its primary supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. He said it will continue to push Boeing to improve its safety culture in the wake of the January 5 incident in which a door plug blew off during an Alaska Airlines flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the Boeing 737 Max. But he also said that the FAA was not blameless in that incident. \u201cLet me also acknowledge the FAA should have had much better visibility into what was happening at Boeing before January 5,\u201d he said in his opening remarks to the committee. \u201cThe FAA\u2019s approach was too hands off, too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections. We have changed that approach over the last several months. And those changes are permanent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have now moved to a more active, comprehensive oversight model - the audit plus inspection approach.\u201d Whitaker, who was confirmed to his job heading the nation\u2019s primary aviation regulator in October, said he will be visiting Boeing\u2019s South Carolina factory himself tomorrow, and its plant that makes the 737 Max in Renton, Washington in September. Whitaker said that the FAA previously had 24 inspectors at Boeing and Spirit and that the number was in the low 30s now. Its target is 55 inspectors, although he did not give a date for when that would be in place. And he said that number could change over time. \u201cWe can no longer afford to remain reactive,\u201d he said. A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board has found that bolts necessary to keep the door plug on the Alaska Air plane in place were missing from the plane at the time it left the Boeing factory in Washington roughly two months before the flight. Under questions at Thursday\u2019s hearing, Whitaker said the FAA did not have any inspectors in the factories at that time when the piece was put in. Instead the FAA staff was focused on paperwork audits instead of actual inspections. \u201cWe clearly did not have enough folks to see what was going on in that factory,\u201d he said. Safety experience\u2026 in the dairy industry But finding the inspectors could be a problem. Sen. Maria Cantwell, the Washington Democrat who is chair of the committee, questioned the backgrounds of some of the safety inspectors. \u201cI\u2019m definitely hearing \u2018We don\u2019t have enough aviation inspectors.\u2019 And \u2018We don\u2019t even have enough qualified instructors at schools,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cOne story I heard was that they said, \u2018Yes, I have safety experience. But it\u2019s in the dairy industry.\u2019 We need an aviation inspector on the floor who has aviation experience, not just safety experience.\u201d Whitaker responded that while the agency is having to provide some training for new hires, it is finding the experienced inspectors it needs for Boeing. \u201cWith respect to Boeing, we\u2019re putting our most experienced and best people on this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly the most important issue we\u2019re dealing with right now.\u201d But for years the FAA has relied on employees of Boeing and other manufacturers to inspect their own companies, then report to the FAA, under what is known as \u201cdelegation of authority.\u201d That structure is still in place, even with more FAA employees now on the floor at Boeing factories. That reliance on self-inspection and self-certification first started getting attention in 2019 after two fatal crashes of the 737 Max killed 346 people and led to a 20-month grounding of the plane. The fact that much of the certification of the Max, a relatively new aircraft, was done by Boeing employees, not FAA staff, raised questions in Congress and an outcry among families of some of the crash victims. In January, after the Alaska Air flight, Whitaker joined those who suggested the process needed to be changed. \u201cIt is time to re-examine the delegation of authority and assess any associated safety risks,\u201d said Whitaker a week after the incident. \u201cThe grounding of the 737-9 and the multiple production-related issues identified in recent years require us to look at every option to reduce risk.\u201d In February the FAA gave Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to improve safety. And in late May when the plan was submitted, the FAA announced it was leaving a limit on production levels in place until safety improves. \u201cThere must be a fundamental shift in the company\u2019s safety culture in order to holistically address its quality and safety challenges,\u201d Whitaker said on Thursday. \u201cThis is about systemic change, and there\u2019s a lot of work to be done.\u201d But he said there has been a shift in tone in discussions between the FAA and Boeing executives since the January incident. \u201cMy focus has been on making it clear this is a very long-term journey. You don\u2019t change the culture of an organization. We\u2019ve seen an increasing recognition that this is a long journey ahead.\u201d Boeing also said it has made significant changes since January. \u201cWe listened to our employees, engaged transparently with our regulator, welcomed the findings and recommendations from the FAA \u2026. and invited scrutiny from customers and independent experts,\u201d it said in a statement when asked for a comment on Thursday\u2019s hearing. \u201cWe will work under the FAA\u2019s oversight and uphold our responsibility to the flying public to continue delivering safe, high-quality airplanes.\u201d  This story has been updated with additional reporting and context.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/business/faa-boeing-oversight-too-hands-off/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}

Thursday\u2019s order by the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas sets the date for a high-profile showdown over Media Matters\u2019 research highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on the social media platform. In November, X\u00a0sued Media Matters, alleging that the group went out of its way to misrepresent the likelihood that users may encounter hate speech on the platform.

Media Matters President Angelo Carusone\u00a0has previously called X\u2019s suit \u201cfrivolous\u201d and an attempt to silence Musk\u2019s critics. The lawsuit claimed that Media Matters\u2019 testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the group\u2019s reports distorted the odds of a person seeing extremist material. Motions for summary judgment in the case are due in December, and a decision by the judge on those filings could decide the case prior to trial. Musk has suffered setbacks in similar cases. In March, a federal judge in California reprimanded X and tossed out a lawsuit it had filed against another watchdog group, the Center for Countering Digital Hate.

{"id": "2024_06_17_media_alex-jones-infowars-shut-down", "text": "Alex Jones\u2019\u00a0notorious\u00a0conspiracy\u00a0platform Infowars may have survived a\u00a0key decision from a federal judge last week, but the platform\u2019s future is far from secure. A bankruptcy judge in Houston on Friday allowed Jones to liquidate his personal assets to help pay the nearly $1.5 billion that he owes the families of the Sandy Hook massacre victims but dismissed the\u00a0separate\u00a0bankruptcy\u00a0case\u00a0of Infowars\u2019 parent company Free Speech Systems. The dismissal is not a reflection on Jones or whatever the judge might feel about Infowars. Rather, it was a question of economic reality \u2013 how the judge could help the families get the most value out of Jones and Infowars. \u201cThis case is one of the more difficult cases I\u2019ve had,\u201d Judge Christopher\u00a0Lopez said during a lengthy and at times emotional ruling. \u201cI was never asked today to make a decision to shut down a show or not. That was never going to happen today one way or another.\u201d What the judge decided Lopez approved Jones\u2019 request to liquidate his personal assets to help pay off his debts, but dismissed a request to \u201cconvert\u201d Free Speech Systems\u2019 bankruptcy to liquidation. Some of the Sandy Hook families had requested the judge move to liquidate Jones\u2019 Free Speech Systems company. They\u00a0argued it would not only dismantle a platform that had caused so much agony but would also ensure a fair way to dole out the proceeds of a sell-off. But\u00a0a\u00a0handful of\u00a0other families had argued against liquidation. The reasoning: Liquidation is a lengthy and costly process, and the families have yet to see a dime from the more than a billion dollars Jones owes them. Lopez noted that this may be one of the longest-running cases of its kind in the country. Because the company is not in liquidation, the families can immediately go after Free Speech System\u2019s assets in state courts, a much faster and less costly process (liquidation would have involved various bankruptcy professionals who take a lot of fees). \u201cI have to do what\u2019s in the best interest of credito\ufeffrs,\u201d Lopez said on Friday, adding, \u201cWhen you look at it, I think creditors are better served in pursuing their state court rights.\u201d Since Jones is the owner of Free Speech Systems, and Jones himself is in bankruptcy, the families can go after the company\u2019s assets. In a sadly ironic twist, the more money Jones makes by broadcasting his lies and conspiracy theories on Infowars, the more of the nearly $1.5 billion he owes to the families could actually be paid. What happens to Infowars For now, nothing changes for Jones\u2019 Infowars shows. The company can continue operating, and Jones is free to say what he wants \u2013 including commenting about Sandy Hook \u2013 as he wishes. But Jones\u2019 personal stake in the company is part of his own personal liquidation. Because of Jones\u2019 bankruptcy, Free Speech Systems is now in the hands of a court-appointed trustee. It\u2019s not clear what that trustee will do - either keep Free Speech Systems operating or sell it off. \u201cI do not now own Infowars,\u201d Jones said during an \u201cemergency\u201d show on Saturday. \u201cIt is now controlled by the court trustee. I am the CEO and the decision maker.\u201d Jay Westbrook,\u00a0a University of Texas bankruptcy law professor, said\u00a0the personal bankruptcy trustee will take over Jones\u2019s interest in Free Speech Systems. \u201c(The trustee) will work to maximize the value of Jones\u2019s shares for the benefit of his creditors, including the possibility of selling Jones\u2019s shares,\u201d Westbrook said. Jones said on Saturday he estimates the company has up to five more months before some sort of sale. \u201cIf we make it a few more months\u2026 if we make it that, we\u2019ll survive, under new management and ownership but I\u2019ll still be as host here, I\u2019ll still be in control of what I say or I won\u2019t be here,\u201d Jones said on Saturday. \u201cBut we just got more runway. It\u2019s like in a video game where you\u2019re down to one life, you get another life.\u201d What happens next Still uncertain is what sort of power the court-appointed trustee has over Free Speech Systems. Lopez will likely schedule a new hearing to determine the trustee\u2019s powers. But no matter what happens to the company, Jones still owes nearly $1.5 billion. If Free Speech Systems continues operating and making money for Jones, those funds will ultimately need to go to paying the families. \u201cOnce Jones\u2019s bankruptcy case ends, the families can start to use state court collection tools (garnishment, attachment, foreclosure) to get paid from income that Jones earns and any property he acquires since he filed for bankruptcy until their judgments are paid in full,\u201d Marie Reilly, professor of bankruptcy law at Penn State University, told CNN. While Jones now acknowledges the Sandy Hook massacre took place, he is free to continue espousing dangerous rhetoric and conspiracy theories on his platforms.In recent days, Jones has fantasized on his show about executing\u00a0Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,\u00a0and others who supposedly \u201clied to\u00a0Trump.\u201d But even if Infowars is shut down, Jones can continue posting on his X account after it was restored last year by Elon Musk or join other high-profile platforms. Earlier this month, Tucker Carlson, the far-right former Fox News host, announced Jones would join him for a stop on his upcoming national live speaking tour. Days later, Jones was quietly dropped from the tour without explanation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/media/alex-jones-infowars-shut-down/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_investing_london-overtakes-paris-stock-index", "text": "London\u2019s stock market has edged ahead of its rival in Paris as fears grow over the outcome of France\u2019s looming parliamentary elections. All stocks listed in France are now worth about $3.13 trillion in total, compared with $3.18 trillion for all shares listed in the United Kingdom,\u00a0Bloomberg reported Monday, based on the data it had compiled. On Tuesday, the CAC All-Share index in Paris was still marginally bigger than London\u2019s FTSE equivalent, but the latter only accounts for 98% of the market value of UK-listed shares. London\u2019s comeback as Europe\u2019s biggest equity market is \u201cmostly\u201d the result of French President Emmanuel Macron calling snap elections for June 9 after his party was trounced by the French far right in a vote for European Union lawmakers, according to Axel Rudolph, a senior market analyst at trading platform IG Group. \u201cFinancial markets don\u2019t like uncertainty, and the fact that you\u2019ve had such a shift to the right in the French European elections has led people to worry (about what comes next),\u201d he told CNN. Since June 9, the CAC 40 of leading French stocks has shed more than 5% of its value \u2014\u00a0equivalent to $160 billion \u2014\u00a0as investors ponder the prospect of the far-right National Rally playing a much bigger role in the parliament of Europe\u2019s second-largest economy. The first round of the French elections is scheduled for June 30, followed by a second round on July 7. An opinion poll by research firm OpinionWay released Friday showed that 32% of respondents intended to vote for the National Rally in the first round, 25% for a coalition of left-wing parties, and 19% for Macron\u2019s centrist party. French banking stocks have fared particularly badly since Macron called the elections. Shares in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale have tumbled\u00a0nearly 14%, while shares in BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole have fallen 10.6% and 11.2% respectively. Hubert\u00a0de Barochez, a senior market economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said investors might be concerned that a parliament run by the National Rally would penalize banks. \u201cGenerally, quite populist governments attack banks and their proceeds\u2026 (There) might be fears about additional taxes on banks,\u201d he told CNN. Another reason for the rout in French banking stocks is the fact that \u201cbanks own quite a lot of the country\u2019s public debt,\u201d he added. The prices of those government bonds have fallen since June 9, driving up their yields or interest rates demanded by investors as they see a higher risk in holding the debt. A parliament dominated by the far right could make it harder to reduce France\u2019s huge government debt pile, equal to 110.6% of gross domestic product at the end of last year, and could even add to it. A bitterly divided assembly would also struggle to cut the budget deficit \u2014 the gap between government spending and tax receipts \u2014 which\u00a0reached 5.5%\u00a0of GDP last year. In contrast with the political and financial turmoil in France, UK financial markets are \u201crelatively stable,\u201d said Rudolph at IG Group. The UK is gearing up for its own general election on July 4, which the opposition Labour Party is predicted to win by a wide margin. In addition, now that uncertainty surrounding Brexit has subsided and Britain has come out of a short recession, investors are snapping up stocks in UK companies, attracted by their low valuations compared with US stocks, Rudolph added. Similarly, Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, an investment platform, wrote in a note Tuesday: \u201cThere are increasing signs that the UK is gaining some favor among overseas investors, given its mix of stable, cash-generative companies which are cheap by comparison (with French stocks) by historic standards.\u201d On the other side of the English Channel, the National Rally has promised to raise public spending and slash VAT on electricity and fuel if it comes to power. Credit ratings agencies are already keeping a close eye on France, one of the EU\u2019s three most-indebted countries. Last month, S&P\u00a0downgraded\u00a0the country\u2019s long-term credit score and said it expected its budget deficit to narrow to 3.5% of GDP in 2027, well above the 2.9% targeted by the current\u00a0government. Mohit Kumar, chief economist for Europe at Jefferies, an investment bank, wrote in a note Tuesday: \u201cOur view on France remains that yes, we should be worried about the debt and deficit picture\u2026 We do not see French deficit coming below 3% over the next five-year horizon.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/investing/london-overtakes-paris-stock-index/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.

{"id": "2023_11_20_investing_microsoft-stock-record-high-altman-openai", "text": "Microsoft stock reached a record high on Monday after the company said that Sam Altman, former chief executive of OpenAI, will join the company to head its artificial intelligence innovation leg. Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing. Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive. Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year. The stock is one of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that have powered the lion\u2019s share of the market\u2019s returns this year, boosted by Wall Street\u2019s bet that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in tech. Dan Ives, tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, reiterated his $425 price target for Microsoft\u2019s stock following Altman\u2019s and Brockman\u2019s hires. \u201cWe view Microsoft now even in a stronger position from an AI perspective with Altman and Brockman\u201d at the company, Ives wrote in a note on Monday. Other members of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d saw a boost on Monday.

{"id": "2024_06_18_business_netflix-house-locations-experiential-venues", "text": "Netflix is opening massive entertainment venues in two cities that it says will allow fans to immerse themselves in the worlds of their favorite shows. The \u201cexperiential\u201d complexes, called Netflix Houses, will include elaborate events, themed gift shops and restaurants. In a repurposing of empty retail space, the houses will occupy former department store locations at Dallas Galleria and King of Prussia mall (near Philadelphia). Both will span more than 100,000 square feet and are set to open in 2025, according to the streaming giant. It\u2019s Netflix\u2019s TV tweak on a theme park. For fans of its \u201cSquid Game\u201d dark drama and related reality show, for example, Netflix promises to recreate the program\u2019s Glass Bridge challenge. Competitors walk or jump across clear panels that shatter \u2014 and drop them \u2014 if they stand on the wrong one. It\u2019s a risky move. Critics of the expansion note that attracting repeat business will be challenging. \u201cOne of the keys to success will be to keep the offer refreshed, so that it keeps people coming back to what\u2019s new,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData. Netflix has already had considerable success with elaborate touring productions and events tied to some of its higher-profile programming. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is currently hosting a tour of \u201cBridgerton\u201d High Tea; Toronto has a \u201cKnives Out\u201d dinner party; and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil offers an immersive \u201cStranger Things\u201d experience. Risks and rewards All this is not a new idea, though. \u201cDisney has monetized its content for years and has a very successful retail business through licensing, its own stores, and shop-in-shop concepts,\u201d said Saunders. For Netflix, it\u2019s just the latest move in a series of efforts to broaden its profile and income beyond standard streaming\u2014 even though the bulk of its profits have come from its core business. These new initiatives come at a time profits in the streaming industry are getting squeezed. So the company has cut back on creating original programming but has expanded its video game offerings, rolling out mobile-friendly games from the \u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d franchise. In a brand extension, It also partnered with Williams Sonoma on a line of \u201cBridgerton\u201d-themed dinnerware, paper goods, foods and linens. TikTok influencer, product reviewer and \u201cBridgerton\u201d fan Carrie Berk, who has twice attended \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Ball\u201d said she thinks Netflix\u2019s new venture will be met with success. (She was not compensated by Netflix or given tickets to the events.) \u201cI think that it\u2019s brilliant that Netflix is bringing that magic IRL!\u201d she said. (IRL stands for \u201cin real life.\u201d) For years, \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Ball\u201d has been staged in various cities two or three times daily. Fans could enjoy dances and watch performances by violin players and acrobats dressed in historically accurate garb under chandelier lighting. In keeping with the show\u2019s plot, the Queen named a \u201cDiamond of the Season\u201d at each performance. Social media influencers were invited to write a letter and make their case for why they should be chosen, illustrating Netflix\u2019s keen interest in the social media world. Now, \u201cNetflix House represents the next generation of our distinctive offerings,\u201d said Netflix Chief Marketing Officer Marian Lee, in a statement. \u201cThe venues will bring our beloved stories to life in new ever-changing, and unexpected ways.\u201d Berk agreed and told CNN of her experience, \u201cIt really made me feel like I stepped into the world of the show.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/business/netflix-house-locations-experiential-venues/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_media_washington-post-will-lewis-phone-hacking", "text": "A report from the New York Times on Saturday alleges\u00a0Will Lewis, the Washington Post\u2019s embattled new publisher and chief executive,\u00a0used fraudulent and unethical methods\u00a0to obtain information for articles while working at the London-based Sunday Times\u00a0in the early 2000s. Citing a former co-worker of Lewis\u2019, a private investigator and its own investigation of newspaper archives, the New York Times said Lewis used phone and company records that were\u00a0\u201cfraudulently obtained\u201d\u00a0through hacking and paying sources for information. Through the haze of accusations, it remains unclear whether these claims will prompt Lewis to step down from the helm of one of the most distinguished outlets in the country. Even so, experts see Lewis\u2019 grasp on the newsroom as one that is increasingly weakening. Margaret Sullivan, executive director of the Craig\u00a0Newmark Center for Journalism Ethics and Security at Columbia University\u2019s School of Journalism, told CNN on Sunday that Lewis\u2019 position is \u201cincreasingly untenable.\u201d These latest allegations of\u00a0questionable\u00a0journalistic ethics could also leave an enduring impression on a newsroom already reeling from the blindsiding ouster of its executive editor,\u00a0Sally Buzbee. The allegations may also end up reflecting on the paper\u2019s own reputation as a standard-bearer for American journalism. Late on Sunday, the Washington Post itself published a story about Robert Winnett, whom Lewis appointed to take the top job at the Post\u2019s core newsroom after the US presidential election in November. The Post article alleged that Winnett, a Lewis protege, was linked to a man who used dishonest means to obtain information that Winnett\u00a0then used in his journalism. In a statement, the Washington Post said: \u201cWe cover The Washington Post independently, rigorously and fairly. Given perceived and potential conflicts, we have asked former senior managing editor Cameron Barr, who stepped down from that position in 2023 and now has a contractual relationship as a senior associate editor, to oversee this coverage. The publisher has no involvement in or influence on our reporting.\u201d In a follow-up on Monday, the Post added that \u201cThe executive editor and relevant masthead editors review and provide input, with Cameron\u2019s concurrence, to ensure that our work meets our highest standards.\u201d Winnett did not immediately respond to a CNN query via LinkedIn. The Society of Professional Journalists, which represents about 7,000 members across the country and whose journalism standards\u00a0are recognized in\u00a0many newsrooms, warns journalists in its\u00a0Code of Ethics: \u201cDo not pay for access to news.\u201d While SPJ does not explicitly address hacking as a means of newsgathering, it does tell journalists to \u201cavoid undercover or other surreptitious methods of gathering information unless traditional, open methods will not yield information vital to the public\u201d but cautions that \u201cpursuit of the news is not a license for arrogance of\u00a0undue intrusiveness.\u201d The new accusations come as Lewis tries to fend off resurfacing allegations of his involvement in a UK phone hacking scandal coverup, in which he has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.\u00a0Lewis has\u00a0previously said\u00a0his role in the scandal consisted of rooting out problematic behavior. A spokesperson for the Washington Post told CNN Lewis declined to comment. A Washington Post source with knowledge of internal meetings at the paper last week told CNN that Lewis has told employees \u201chis role as publisher is to create the environment for great journalism and to encourage and support it, that he will never interfere in the journalism and that he is very clear about the lines that should not be crossed.\u201d The\u00a0decade-old scandal\u00a0engulfed right-wing media mogul Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News of the World tabloid and was revived in recent years in a\u00a0new lawsuit filed\u00a0by Prince Harry and Hollywood figures including Guy Ritchie and Hugh Grant. At the time of the News of the World controversy, Lewis was a senior executive at Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation. But a cascade of claims has followed Lewis in recent weeks, mostly involving\u00a0alleged attempts to suppress stories about his connection with the coverup. Earlier this month, the New York Times first reported that Lewis, who took the reins at the Washington Post on January 2, clashed with\u00a0Buzbee\u00a0over publishing an article in May that named him in connection to the scandal,\u00a0although a\u00a0spokesperson for Lewis has denied he pressured Buzbee\u00a0to quash the article, according to NPR.  Buzbee abruptly left the company earlier this month. Days later, an NPR reporter said Lewis offered him an interview in exchange for quashing a forthcoming article about the scandal. The Washington Post did not respond to CNN with regard to these allegations. A spokesperson for Lewis\u00a0told the New York Times earlier this month\u00a0when the story broke that \u201cwhen he was a private citizen ahead of joining The Washington Post, he had off the record conversations with an employee of NPR about a story the employee then published.\u201d The spokesperson added that any request for an interview after he joined the Washington Post was \u201cprocessed through the normal corporate communication channels.\u201d Buzbee\u2019s departure has seemingly frayed Lewis\u2019 command of his newsroom even further. A number of Post staffers who spoke to CNN have described plummeting morale. \u201cIt\u2019s as bad as I\u2019ve ever seen it, truly,\u201d one staffer said earlier this month, noting that the Washington Post has hit \u201crough patches\u201d before but that the stormy atmosphere hanging over the outlet is unprecedented. In an opinion piece for the Guardian on Wednesday, Sullivan wrote that firing Lewis and finding a new CEO is \u201cthe cleanest, best move\u201d Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos could make. Lewis\u2019 insistence on tamping down reporting about him \u201chas motivated several news organizations to look more deeply into his past; it\u2019s possible that some new revelation will make his Post leadership position even more untenable and will force Bezos\u2019 hand,\u201d she added. Sullivan also wrote in her op-ed that Lewis could try to repair the trust both within and outside the newsroom by acknowledging that he will not cross any ethical lines and reiterating his commitment to giving staffers \u201ctrue editorial independence.\u201d He could also work toward reinstating an independent public editor or ombudsman \u2014 a position the Washington Post nixed more than a decade ago \u2014 who would oversee the paper\u2019s implementation of journalistic ethics.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/media/washington-post-will-lewis-phone-hacking/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}

The S&P 500 index has climbed nearly 15% this year and clinched 30 record-high closes. Strong corporate earnings and the artificial intelligence helped drive stocks higher at the start of this year, despite a slew of hotter-than-expected inflation reports that fueled concerns the Federal Reserve would be slow to cut interest rates in 2024. Then, fresh data in May revealed last week that inflation is cooling again and getting closer to the Fed\u2019s 2% target. The central bank at its June policy meeting held rates steady and penciled in one cut for 2024. After waffling over whether the Fed would ease monetary policy at all in 2024, traders are now betting on two to three cuts, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The new backdrop of cooling inflation coupled with rate cuts on the horizon is prompting investors to up their bullish wagers. Goldman Sachs on Friday raised its year-end target for the benchmark index to 5,600 from 5,200, citing a strong outlook for corporate profits. That would be a 2.3% advance from Monday\u2019s close. Evercore ISI raised its price target to 6,000 for the S&P 500, a reversal from its previous, more gloomy 4,750 target. That higher level would be a 9.6% jump from Monday\u2019s close. \u201cThe backdrop of slowing inflation, a Fed intent on cutting rates and steady growth have supported Goldilocks,\u201d wrote Julian Emanuel, a senior managing director at Evercore ISI, in a Sunday note. \u201cThe rally has room.\u201d The market has also been distinguished by uncharacteristic calm. Stock sell-offs have been short and shallow. The S&P 500 has had its longest stretch of trading days without a 2% or more decline since February 2018, according to SoFi data as of June 12. While low volatility sounds like a positive, it\u2019s not without danger. It suggests that investors are taking on more risk in their portfolios due to an overly optimistic view and could be caught flat-footed if the tide turns. There\u2019s no shortage of risks that could unnerve markets in the coming months. Much of the S&P 500 index\u2019s returns are tied to the mega-cap tech Magnificent Seven stocks, leaving the market dependent on just a handful of names to continue its monster run. Stocks could also wobble leading up to the US presidential election in November. Some investors warn that despite encouraging economic data, a recession could still be in the cards for 2024 or next year. Despite its more bullish baseline target, Goldman Sachs warned that the S&P 500 index could end the year at 4,800, a 12.3% drop from current levels, if economic growth data turns sour and markets price in higher odds of a recession. The strange economics of pig meat: Ham prices are down, but bacon\u2019s up Shoppers in the meat aisle may have noticed something weird last month: Bacon prices are sizzling, but ham\u2019s not so hot, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner. Bacon is more expensive than it was a year ago, with prices up 6.9% from May 2023 to May of this year, according to inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Pork chops were up too, by 4.6%. But ham prices were lower, falling 5.4% overall and dropping 6.3% when you exclude canned varieties. What gives? Econ buffs may remember that prices are set according to supply and demand. You\u2019d expect any supply issues \u2014 like too many hogs, or too few \u2014 to cause prices of each of the items to move up or down, all in the same direction. The discrepancy, then, must be caused by differences on the demand side. And it is: Demand for domestic pork has grown in recent years outside of the US. But rising demand, plus the same or reduced supply, should push prices up, not down. So again, what gives? To understand you have to zoom out, looking at long-term retail pricing strategy and food price trends.

Then, he was told the purchase might get him prison time, reports my colleague Samantha Delouya. \u201cThat was really shocking to me. It\u2019s just purchasing property,\u201d Bian, who is originally from Nanjing, China, said. \u201cOnce I learned that, I didn\u2019t even bother to look anymore.\u201d Bian, a 31-year-old software engineer who has lived in the US for 12 years, is a recipient of an H-1B visa, which allows companies to employ foreign workers. For nearly a year, however, it has been a crime for him to purchase a home in Florida after the state\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, signed a law restricting Chinese nationals without US green cards from purchasing property in the state. Bian and other Florida residents told CNN that the rules have fostered uneasiness and confusion among ethnic Chinese people living in the state. Some say the law has damaged their businesses, while others say they are considering abandoning Florida altogether. And the law underscores the heightened tensions between the two biggest economies in the world in a US presidential election year. Bian said that lately, he had begun reconsidering his life in Florida. He isn\u2019t alone. Ever since Florida Senate Bill 264 went into effect on July 1, 2023, Chinese citizens without green cards face a felony charge and possible prison time if they purchase property in the state. Sellers and real estate agents can also be found liable under the law.

The recall follows a May 21 accident in Phoenix, Arizona, in which a Waymo driverless car hit a telephone pole that was installed in the roadway in an alley. The vehicle was pulling over to pick up a passenger when it struck the pole at low speed, according to Waymo. While the car was severely damaged, no one was hurt, according to documents Waymo filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The recall applies only to the fleet of modified Jaguar I-Pace SUVs Waymo owns and operates itself. The recall involves a software update on all 672 of the vehicles. The recall was first reported by The Verge. \u201cWe have already deployed mapping and software updates across our entire fleet, and this does not impact our current operations,\u201d a Waymo spokesperson said in an email. In documents filed with the National Highway Traffic Administration, Waymo described the issue is as an \u201c[i]nsufficient ability to avoid pole or pole-like permanent objects within the drivable surface [which] may result in an increased risk of a collision.\u201d This became an issue in circumstances where there wasn\u2019t a curb or clear road shoulder \u2013 such as in an alleyway where the road surface reaches from buildings on one side to buildings on the other \u2013 and there were poles installed within that roadway.

That doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t face challenges. The World Bank on Tuesday raised its 2024 outlook for global economic growth to hold steady at 2.6%, an increase from its previous projection of 2.4% growth. But the group warned that growth won\u2019t be felt evenly or match the clip seen before the Covid pandemic. \u201cFour years after the upheavals caused by the pandemic, conflicts, inflation, and monetary tightening, it appears that global economic growth is steadying,\u201d Indermit Gill, the World Bank\u2019s chief economist, said in a release accompanying the report. \u201cHowever, growth is at lower levels than before 2020. Prospects for the world\u2019s poorest economies are even more worrisome.\u201d Here are three risks the World Bank sees. High interest rates. The group expects global inflation to slow to 3.5% this year and 2.9% in 2025 but fall at a more sluggish pace than it expected six months ago. World interest rates will likely average 4% over 2025 and 2026, roughly double the average of the two decades preceding the pandemic, according to the World Bank. The European Central Bank and Bank of Canada have already cut their key interest rates in recent weeks. The US Federal Reserve has yet to follow, holding rates steady for a seventh consecutive time on Wednesday. The Fed also trimmed its projections for rate cuts this year from three to one. Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the progress made on tamping down prices but said that the central bank needs to see inflation closer to its 2% target before easing monetary policy. \u201cAn environment of \u2018higher-for-longer\u2019 rates would mean tighter global financial conditions and much weaker growth in developing economies,\u201d said Ayhan Kose, the World Bank\u2019s deputy chief economist, in a release. Geopolitical tensions. The World Bank said that spillover risk from the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel-Hamas war could curb global growth by pushing up oil prices and shipping costs. Oil prices have come down since initial spikes from both wars, with the price of international crude futures settling at $82.60 a barrel on Wednesday. Attacks on container vessels in the Red Sea on one of the world\u2019s most important trade routes have driven up costs and led to shipping delays. \u201cEscalating conflict could also dent global business and consumer sentiment, and increase risk aversion, weighing on demand and growth,\u201d the report said. Politics. Risks also stem from several possible changes to government leadership this year. Key elections have occurred or are set to take place in India, Mexico, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, among dozens of other countries. Trade tensions are already brewing between some of the world\u2019s biggest global economic engines. China said last month that it staunchly opposes new US tariffs on $18 billion worth of imports of Chinese electric vehicles and other products, warning that the trade barriers would affect the wider relationship between the two economic superpowers. Then, the European Commission on Wednesday said that the EU is hiking tariffs on EVs imported from China, drawing blowback from Beijing. \u201cHeightened trade policy-related uncertainty and the potential for more inward-looking policies could weigh on trade prospects and economic activity,\u201d the World Bank report said. Even with food prices flattening out, the cost of dining out is still going up Grocery prices stayed flat in May, after ticking down the month before. But menu prices, a source of frustration for budget-conscious consumers, are still going up \u2014 even as restaurants brag about their discounted meals, reports my colleague Danielle Wiener-Bronner. Menu prices rose 0.4% at sit-down restaurants from April to May, adjusted for seasonal swings, according to inflation data released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In that time prices ticked up 0.2% at limited service spots, which include fast casual and fast food joints. The difference between grocery increases and menu price inflation was more pronounced for the full year. Grocery prices rose 1% in the 12 months through May. In that period, menu prices at full-service, or sit-down, restaurants rose 3.5%. They jumped 4.5% at limited-service restaurants, which include fast food and fast casual joints. The increases, particularly in fast food prices, have caused customers to pull back on spending and complain online, eroding the sector\u2019s reputation for affordability. Restaurant chains raise menu prices every year, but since the pandemic hikes have been coming in fast and furious. Executives noted that for a while, the higher prices didn\u2019t scare people off. But customers finally snapped, leaving chains to reverse course and sometimes get defensive. McDonald\u2019s USA president Joe Erlinger recently said in an open letter that prices have risen about 21% over five years. That\u2019s a bit less than inflation overall \u2014 not 100% as, he said, people may think, thanks to an analysis from FinanceBuzz. It recently found that McDonald\u2019s prices have risen 100% since 2014. Still, he acknowledged that at some locations, Big Mac meals may be going for much higher. On TikTok, complaints of $3 McDonald\u2019s hash browns and $16 meals have gone viral. Read more here. Politicians keep courting the TikTok vote. Users aren\u2019t impressed TikTok may not be as hot a place for politics as many seem to think. The attention devoted to TikTok as a powerful force in US politics \u2014 for better or for worse \u2014 does not seem to match up with the experience of most TikTok users, according to new survey data released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. As the short-form video app has surged to 170 million US users, politicians have flocked to TikTok in hopes of wooing young voters. Former President Donald Trump joined TikTok last week, amassing 6 million followers in a matter of days. President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign launched on TikTok in February and has posted more than 200 videos \u2014 though the campaign\u2019s following is just a fraction of Trump\u2019s at 373,000. Other politicians, meanwhile, warn that TikTok\u2019s links to China through its parent company mean the Chinese government could theoretically try to influence US politics on a massive scale, if it ever accessed the personal data of TikTok users.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_business_titan-submersible-titanic-tourism", "text": "A year ago Tuesday, the world watched in horror as a multinational search began for a commercial sub and five passengers that, days later, would end in tragedy. The agonizing spectacle sent a chill through the small but growing community of deep-sea submersible enthusiasts. OceanGate, the controversial operator behind the ill-fated sub, folded shortly after officials revealed the vessel had imploded on its way down to the site of the Titanic. With OceanGate closed for business, the market for Titanic sub tourism appeared to slam shut. But rather than tanking the entire industry, the event created an opportunity for submersible operators to double-down on their messaging around safety, and cast OceanGate as a rogue startup. One leading sub operator, eager to demonstrate that the Titan sub failed to live up to the industry standards that can make trips to the ocean floor relatively safe, is already planning its own journey to the wreckage of the Titanic, where Titan was headed before it collapsed. \u201cIf there is any positive to draw from the situation, the legacy will be that there is further investment being made in deep ocean submersibles,\u201d said industry leader Triton Submarines, in a statement. In fact, just days after OceanGate disaster, the real-estate billionaire Larry Connor was on the phone with Triton\u2019s CEO, urging him to build a sub that would reassure the world that sub travel, even as deep as the Titanic\u2019s wreckage, could be done safely, according to the Wall Street Journal. \u201cI want to show people worldwide that while the ocean is extremely powerful, it can be wonderful and enjoyable and really kind of life-changing if you go about it the right way,\u201d Connor told the WSJ. Triton, through a spokesperson, told CNN that trip was in the early planning stages and that \u201cwe can\u2019t share a timeline yet.\u201d OceanGate\u2019s legacy OceanGate, which shut down operations last July, had been a rising but controversial player in the tight-knit world of manned submersibles. But in its pursuit of \u201cincreasing access to the deep ocean through innovation,\u201d OceanGate frequently skirted regulations and pushed back against industry standards. Notably, its founder Stockton Rush, who was one of the five people killed aboard Titan, insisted that his unconventional carbon fiber hull was safe even after experts warned him that it wasn\u2019t as safe as the more-expensive titanium used by rivals. \u201cAt some point, safety just is pure waste,\u201d Rush once\u00a0told journalist David Pogue. \u201cI mean, if you just want to be safe, don\u2019t get out of bed. Don\u2019t get in your car. Don\u2019t do anything.\u201d With a brand name uncomfortably similar to that of the ill-fated sub, Triton Submarines has spent the past year trying to distinguish itself from OceanGate. Two of its main points:\u00a0 1) OceanGate was a rogue operation that skirted regulations and ignored repeated warnings from the tight-knit community of deep sea explorers.\u00a0 2) OceanGate\u2019s sub designs were so experimental, no other commercial sub operation would ever replicate them. Triton \u2014 which counts billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio and filmmaker James Cameron among its investors \u2014 is quick to tout the credentials that OceanGate sidestepped, such as submitting its crafts to testing by third parties like the American Bureau of Shipping. \u201cThe deep ocean is no place for compromise,\u201d Triton said in its statement. \u201cIt should be very clear to everyone by now that the events in the North Atlantic, the manner in which the operation was run and the experimental nature of the craft, bears no relation whatsoever to a highly professional, safe and accomplished sector.\u201d The risk of death is the point\n                   The technology needed to reach the Earth\u2019s deepest nooks and crannies is still in its infancy. But if the broader adventure tourism industry offers any guidance, the specter of death will only fuel demand. Every year, about half the climbers who attempt to summit Mount Everest complete the journey, and at least a few of them die in the process. But, somewhat counterintuitively, the deadlier the season, the more interest tends to spike the following year. Permits for Everest increased significantly in the years after 1996, a season that ended the lives of 12 climbers and became the subject of international media attention. And last year was also an especially fatal season, with 17 climbers dying on the route. That led to a 100% increase in business for Furtenbach Adventures, an Austria-based expedition operator. \u201cThere was again the effect of Everest getting more attention after this deadly season,\u201d founder Lukas Furtenbach said in an interview. But he sees a change taking root from previous years when interest spiked. Lately, he says, \u201cit looks like there\u2019s more readiness\u00a0from the client to pay a premium for higher safety margins. \u2026 The the statistics show very clearly that the less you pay for your Everest expedition, the higher the risk to die.\u201d That trend toward extra precaution was echoed by Philippe Brown, founder of luxury adventure travel firm Brown and Hudson. In the immediate aftermath of the Titan\u2019s demise, before OceanGate folded for good, Brown said his firm still had a long waitlist for its Titanic tours, and that business had even ticked up. \u201cThe interest will always be there for boundary-pushing things,\u201d Brown said in an interview Monday. \u201cBut what has happened is that people are way more sensitized to risk, not just in this kind of thing, or summiting Everest, but across chart travel more generally.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/business/titan-submersible-titanic-tourism/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_business_boeing-whistleblower-calhoun-testimony", "text": "A current Boeing employee claims that the company tried to shield broken or out-of-specification 737 Max plane parts from regulators and lost track of them, according to a Senate subcommittee investigation made public Tuesday. Boeing tried to hide the nonconforming parts from Federal Aviation Administration regulators by moving them out of sight and falsifying records, claims Sam Mohawk, the new whistleblower who works for Boeing quality assurance unit in Renton, Washington. Boeing was unable to account for many of the parts that it moved around to skirt regulators, and they probably ended up getting installed in some planes, Mohawk said. Boeing said it received the report from Congressional investigators Monday evening. \u201cWe are reviewing the claims,\u201d said the company\u2019s statement. \u201cWe continuously encourage employees to report all concerns as our priority is to ensure the safety of our airplanes and the flying public.\u201d Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun will be confronted with the new claims in addition to other whistleblower charges about Boeing\u2019s safety lapses at his first-ever congressional hearing Tuesday. The outgoing Boeing CEO plans to apologize for Boeing\u2019s recent safety failures in his testimony. According to his prepared testimony shared with CNN, Calhoun will admit to problems with the company\u2019s culture, but he\u2019ll push back on claims that the company retaliated against those who brought safety issues to light. \u201cMuch has been said about Boeing\u2019s culture. We\u2019ve heard those concerns loud and clear,\u201d he will say in prepared remarks released by Boeing Monday afternoon. \u201cOur culture is far from perfect, but we are taking action and making progress. We understand the gravity, and we are committed to moving forward.\u201d The \u201cfar from perfect\u201d remark is a massive understatement. Boeing has been under intense scrutiny with numerous federal investigations and congressional hearings since a January 5 Alaska Air Boeing 737 Max flight had a door plug blow off, leaving a gaping hole in both the plane and Boeing\u2019s reputation. Beyond the bad publicity of the Senate hearing, Boeing has been ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration to improve its safety issues before it can resume normal production, causing problems for airlines that can\u2019t get the planes they ordered. And that, in turn, has meant higher fares for passengers, who have had their faith the company\u2019s planes sorely tested. Prioritizing profits over safety In prepared remarks released early Tuesday from Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat who chairs the committee, the senator accuses Calhoun of putting profits of airplane safety, of leading a company where those raising safety concerns regularly faced retaliation, despite the claims otherwise from management. \u201cThis is a culture that continues to prioritize profits, push limits, and disregard its workers,\u201d said the prepared opening remarks released by Blumenthal.\u00a0\u201cA culture where those who speak up are silenced and sidelined while blame is pushed down to the factory floor.\u00a0A culture that enables retaliation against those who do not submit to the bottom line.\u00a0A culture that desperately needs to be repaired.\u201d Blumenthal told CNN Tuesday that his committee has heard from a dozen whistleblowers at Boeing, including Mohawk. \u201cHis allegations are extraordinarily serious,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cHis account of the retaliation against him is particularly chilling the pressure that was exerted on him to stay silent. They have a program called Speak up well, he was told to shut up.\u201d Blumenthal said he and others had hoped that Calhoun would change the culture and practices at Boeing for the better when he was took over as CEO in January 2020, 10 months into a 20-month grounding of the 737 Max that followed two fatal crashes. \u201cBut then, this past January, the fa\u00e7ade quite literally blew off the hollow shell that had been Boeing\u2019s promises to the world,\u201d Blumenthal will say, according to his prepared testimony, a reference to the door plug blowout.\u00a0\u201cAnd once that chasm was exposed, we learned that there was virtually no bottom to the void that lay below.\u201d An extensive research document prepared by committee aides show the panel is armed with whistleblower accounts from inside Boeing.\u00a0Some of the whistleblowers in the document have shared their accounts publicly or with CNN. Among them is Mohawk\u2019s claim that in June 2023, when the FAA notified Boeing that it would inspect its Renton plant, the company told employees to move the majority of the 60 nonconforming parts to another location to hide them from inspectors. Many of them were moved back, but some were lost, Mohawk alleges. He also claims Boeing in August 2023 told employees to delete records about nonconforming parts, which led him to complain \u2013 but Boeing took no action. Aides wrote in a memo that the whistleblowers\u00a0\u201cpaint a troubling picture of a company that prioritizes speed of manufacturing and cutting costs over ensuring the quality and safety of aircraft.\u201d \u201cThese misplaced priorities appear to contribute to a safety culture that insufficiently values and addresses the root causes of employee concerns and insufficiently deters retaliation against employees that speak up,\u201d the memo reads. The hearing Tuesday by the Senate\u2019s permanent subcommittee on investigations is entitled \u201cBoeing\u2019s broken safety culture.\u201d It is just the latest congressional hearing this year about safety issues at Boeing but the first time Calhoun is testifying in his more than four years running the troubled company. He will be joined by Howard McKenzie, Boeing\u2019s chief engineer. At an April 17 hearing Boeing engineer Sam Salehpour testified that Boeing is putting out defective planes because he and others who complain faced pressure not to do so. \u201cI have serious concerns about the safety of the 787 and 777 aircraft, and I\u2019m willing to take on professional risk to talk about them,\u201d Salehpour said in his opening statement. He said when he raised concerns, \u201cI was ignored. I was told not to create delays. I was told, frankly, to shut up.\u201d Calhoun\u2019s prepared remarks deny the claims of the whistleblowers and Blumenthal about retaliation against those who raise safety concerns. \u201cWe are committed to making sure every employee feels empowered to speak up if there is a problem,\u201d he\u2019ll say, according to the prepared remarks. \u201cWe also have strict policies in place to prohibit retaliation against employees who come forward. It is our job to listen, regardless of how we obtain feedback, and handle it with the seriousness it deserves.\u201d Will there be changes? Despite the attention the hearing is expected to garner, it\u2019s unlikely to produce significant change at the company, said Richard Aboulafia, managing partner for AeroDynamic Consultancy, an aerospace advisory firm. \u201cNothing has produced change (at Boeing) except frustration from a bunch of airline customers,\u201d said Aboulafia. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what will change as a consequence of this. He (Calhoun) needs to go. He has shown a strong desire to double down on what\u2019s bad.\u201d A preliminary investigation of the Alaska Air incident has found that the plane left a Boeing factory two months before the incident without the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place. And Boeing has yet to produce the paperwork to identify who in the factory installed the door plug without the bolts. It has been harshly criticized by members of Congress and safety regulators and will likely face more criticism Tuesday. Calhoun has already met with members of Congress since the Alaska Air incident, albeit behind closed doors. He has also made numerous public statements to Boeing employees and to investors since the Alaska Air incident. \u201cWe caused the problem, and we understand that,\u201d he told investors in January during a call after reporting its fifth straight annual loss. \u201cWhatever conclusions (from the investigations) are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened. Whatever the specific cause of the accident might turn out to be, an event like this simply must not happen on an airplane that leaves one of our factories. We simply must be better.\u201d Apologies to families, passengers Calhoun\u2019s prepared remarks begin with an apology to the family members of the victims of two fatal 737 Max crashes. Some of those family members plan to attend the hearing. Between them, 346 people were killed in the 2018 and 2019 crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, leading to to a 20-month grounding of the jet to fix a design flaw that caused the crashes. \u201cWe are deeply sorry for your losses,\u201d he\u2019ll say in his opening comments. \u201cNothing is more important than the safety of the people who step on board our airplanes. Every day we seek to honor the memory of those lost.\u201d He also plans to again apologize to the passengers and crew of the Alaska Air flight in January. \u201cWe deeply regret the impact that the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 accident had on Alaska Airlines\u2019 team and its passengers, and we are grateful to the pilots and crew for safely landing the plane,\u201d he\u2019ll say. \u201cWe are thankful that there were no fatalities.\u201d But experts say that it was sheer luck that no one was killed in the Alaska Air incident. This could very well be Calhoun\u2019s only time testifying on Capitol Hill. He has announced plans to retire before the end of this year. His successor has yet to be selected. Beyond Tuesday\u2019s hearing, and the numerous federal investigations it faces, the company could still face criminal liability from the original certification process of the 737 Max. In January of 2021 Boeing agreed to a probationary period, which deferred any prosecution on those charges and which would have exempted it from criminal liability in the crashes. But the January 5 incident aboard the Alaska Air flight happened just days before the end of the probationary period. In May the Justice Department notified Boeing that it was now subject to criminal prosecution. Boeing has denied the Alaska Air incident violated the deferred prosecution agreement and is challenging any potential criminal liability in court. The family members planning to attend Tuesday\u2019s hearing say they want to see Boeing prosecuted criminally. Blumenthal told CNN Tuesday that he will reserve judgment on whether Boeing is guilty of criminal misconduct but that \u201cI think there is mounting evidence, perhaps overwhelming evidence now, that prosecution should be pursued.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/business/boeing-whistleblower-calhoun-testimony/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_business_ham-bacon-prices", "text": "Shoppers in the meat aisle may have noticed something weird last month: Bacon prices are sizzling, but ham\u2019s not so hot. Bacon is more expensive than it was a year ago, with prices up 6.9% from May 2023 to May of this year, according to inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Pork chops were up too, by 4.6%. But ham prices were lower, falling 5.4% overall and dropping 6.3% when you exclude canned varieties. What gives? Econ buffs may remember that prices are set according to supply and demand. You\u2019d expect any supply issues \u2014\u00a0like too many hogs, or too few \u2014\u00a0to cause prices of each of the items to move up or down, all in the same direction. The discrepancy, then, must be caused by differences on the demand side. And it is: Demand for domestic pork has grown in recent years outside of the US. But rising demand, plus the same or reduced supply, should push prices up, not down. So again, what gives? To understand you have to zoom out, looking at long-term retail pricing strategy and food price trends. It\u2019s all relative Glynn Tonsor, a professor in the department of agriculture economics at Kansas State University suggests that if you zoom out, pork prices are indeed going up across the board. From May 2019 to May 2024, according to government data shared by the Federal Reserve of St. Louis, prices of ham, pork chops and bacon all went up. But prices for ham actually went up\u00a0higher\u00a0than the prices of bacon and pork chops. That\u2019s because US ham exports have been booming, particularly to Mexico. \u201cIn the middle of that five-year period, we had that Mexican demand boost,\u201d Tonsor said. \u201cThe US market\u2019s competing with Mexico for the same ham,\u201d he added. \u201cSo the prices are going to be higher domestically.\u201d So that year-over-year decrease you see in the grocery store is really just a drop from those heights. People love bacon Another reason for high bacon prices: Strong demand, even when it\u2019s expensive. \u201cPeople are more willing to pay for bacon than they are maybe some other pork products,\u201d said Christine McCracken, senior animal protein analyst at RaboBank. Retailers set prices strategically. So if they know that customers are more willing to spend more on bacon, they might keep those prices high or raise them to make up for decreases in other areas, where customers might spend less. Prices in the supermarket aren\u2019t just tied to cost. They\u2019re also determined according to the psychology of how people shop. For example: If you see a deal for eggs or pancake mix, you might go into the store for those items. Once inside, you may very well pick up a package of bacon as a treat \u2014 because you\u2019ll be making breakfast at home, anyway, and you got a good price for most of the meal. It\u2019s also possible that bacon prices are not quite as high as they seem because of discounts. \u201cWhat you see more in bacon is kind of a high-low strategy,\u201d said McCracken. \u201cYou\u2019ll keep the price high on a normal day and then put it on super sale.\u201d And even if bacon, pork chops and (taking the long view) ham are getting more expensive, they might still be a cheaper protein option than beef \u2014 not to mention restaurant meals. Cheaper than fast food While grocery prices are flattening, menu prices continue to increase \u2014\u00a0frustrating customers and prompting some to dine out less often and spend less when they do. Grocery prices rose 1% in the 12 months through May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In that period, menu prices at full-service, or sit-down, restaurants rose 3.5%. They jumped 4.5% at limited-service restaurants, which include fast food and fast casual joints. Chains from Burger King to KFC to Starbucks have started offering menu deals in an effort both to bring people back and restore their reputations as affordable food options. Still, buying bacon from the supermarket and making a sandwich at home is cheaper than buying a BLT or a bacon cheeseburger from a restaurant. Even if grocery-store bacon is pricier than it was this time last year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/business/ham-bacon-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_media_jeff-bezos-washington-post-publisher-dilemma", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Jeff Bezos\u00a0has a decision to make \u2014 and it is one that will determine the future course of one of the nation\u2019s most prestigious news organizations. The\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0owner and\u00a0Amazon\u00a0billionaire can continue to stand by\u00a0Will Lewis, the controversy plagued\u00a0Fleet Street\u00a0veteran he tapped as publisher and chief executive of the iconic national broadsheet. Or he can side with his\u00a0Pulitzer Prize-winning newsroom, which is repudiating their new leader in clear and unmistakable terms. But based on conversations with CNN on Monday with nearly a dozen staffers and others familiar with the internal dynamics of The Post, it appears increasingly unlikely that Bezos can have it both ways. Lewis, who continues to face heavy scrutiny over a series of troubling decisions both past and present, has unquestionably lost the room, alienating staffers and creating an untenable position in which it is difficult to see him effectively leading the respected army of reporters under his command. There may have been a moment in which the former\u00a0Rupert Murdoch\u00a0lieutenant could have turned the tide and quelled the uproar within The Post. That fury first saw life shortly after his decision to oust top editor\u00a0Sally Buzbee. In the wake of her sudden exit, it was revealed that he tried to suppress stories at The Post and\u00a0NPR\u00a0about his role cleaning up the\u00a0U.K. phone hacking scandal for Murdoch (which he denies wrongdoing in). Instead of deescalating the situation early on, Lewis lashed out, going so far as to criticize his own media reporters and launch an on-the-record attack aimed at the well-respected NPR media correspondent\u00a0David Folkenflik. And while Lewis later sent the newsroom an apologetic memo following the episodes, it did little to quell concerns, setting into motion a series of stories that have raised serious questions about his judgment and journalistic values, as well as those of his hand-picked future top editor,\u00a0Robert Winnett. The New York Times\u00a0reported over the weekend\u00a0that, in his Fleet Street days, Lewis assigned an article that was based on stolen phone records. And The Post\u00a0reported Sunday that\u00a0a \u201cthief\u201d who used deceptive tactics to obtain private material had ties with Winnett. The stories landed like a one-two punch in The Post newsroom, raising even more alarm and upping the panic level at the newspaper to new heights. Incensed, anxious, and demoralized staffers stressed to CNN on Monday that they just want Bezos to bring this \u201cshit show,\u201d as one staffer put it, to an end. When Bezos first appointed Lewis, staffers at The Post understood that he needed to appoint a publisher and chief executive who would shake things up in the newsroom. They acknowledged to CNN that, under previous boss\u00a0Fred Ryan, The Post had fallen behind outlets like The Times in the post-Donald Trump\u00a0years, both from audience and financial standpoints. And so, when Lewis took the reins in January, the newsroom was more or less, cautiously optimistic about how he would transform the institution. They were willing to give him a chance. But they\u2019re not willing to let him shred the newspaper\u2019s reputation in the process. While the journalists continue to worry about the financial state of their newsroom and want a boss who can seriously address its business woes, they fiercely guard its editorial independence and integrity. And, with respect to that, they strongly believe Lewis and Winnett pose a significant danger. \u201cWe are losing audience and money and the top of the company is a clown show,\u201d a staffer explained to CNN, adding, \u201cAll we have is our credibility and we\u2019ve just taken a gun to that.\u201d The newspaper\u2019s credibility, of course, is inextricably linked to whether it can be a thriving business. Good luck getting people to subscribe to a newspaper that they believe has been ethically compromised. (I would love to see that sales pitch!) And, as one staffer at The Post noted to CNN, behaving in an ethical manner matters greatly when trying to convince a newsroom to reinvent itself. As the person said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how good your ideas are if you have a no-confidence vote from your entire staff.\u201d That said, what Bezos will decide to do as he assesses the situation at The Post remains a mystery. Questions to his spokesperson went unanswered on Monday. And an email sent directly to Bezos went unreturned. But certainly, the tech baron is aware of the rapidly deteriorating situation over on\u00a0K Street. And, presumably, Bezos does not want his stewardship of The Post to be stained by an ugly chapter in which he allowed grave problems to fester and eat away at the institution as he sat idly by. Dismissing Lewis would bring with it some pain for Bezos, sure. It would require him to concede that he got it wrong with Lewis and restart the time-consuming process of finding another publisher. And it might cost him a nice chunk of change \u2014 though an irrelevant one for someone of Bezos\u2019 wealth \u2014 to pay out Lewis\u2019 contract. But keeping Lewis in the position could deliver an even greater level of pain and, with it, unflattering headlines over time. More stories about Lewis are sure to drop in the days and weeks ahead. Top talent may soon head for the exits (indeed, I\u2019m told some staffers are already looking for work elsewhere). And at some point it becomes hard to see how Bezos justifies having a boss oversee a newspaper that is publishing A1 stories spotlighting his ethically-challenged decisions. The best advice in crisis public relations is to reach to the end result as quickly as possible, to avoid an unrelenting drip-drip of bad news. Bezos can surely do the math on this one, given it is not too complicated. And perhaps that is why his camp is not voicing public support for Lewis. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the renowned professor and senior associate dean for leadership studies at the\u00a0Yale School of Management, told CNN on Monday that Bezos has a simple decision to make. Sonnenfeld, who has advised U.S. presidents and scores of corporate leaders, said that if he were advising Bezos, he would tell him Lewis has \u201clost legitimacy to lead\u201d and it\u2019s time to \u201cclean the house.\u201d \u201cThis is a tragic meltdown of the conscience of American journalism bringing shame to the\u00a0Katharine Graham,\u00a0Ben Bradlee,\u00a0Marty Baron\u00a0legacy of collaboration, courage and integrity,\u201d Sonnenfeld said. \u201cBezos must recruit an accomplished, experienced editor whom journalists admire and trust.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/media/jeff-bezos-washington-post-publisher-dilemma/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_media_surgeon-general-social-media-apps-warning-label", "text": "Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said the threat social media poses to children requires urgent action, and he demanded Congress to put a label on the apps as it does with cigarettes and alcohol. \u201cThe mental health crisis among young people is an emergency \u2014 and social media has emerged as an important contributor,\u201d Murthy said in an op-ed in the New York Times Monday. Murthy cited several studies, including a 2019 American Medical Association study published in JAMA that showed teens who spend three hours a day on social media double their risk of depression. Teens spend nearly five hours a day on social media apps, according to a Gallup poll. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Meg Tirrell, Murthy said that the prevalence of social media use among kids is over 95%, \u201cnearly universal.\u201d But Murthy cannot act unilaterally to put a warning label on apps \u2014 that requirement would have to come from Congress, with whom Murthy pleaded to pass a bill. \u201cI put forward this call for a warning because I think it\u2019s essential that parents know what we now know, which is that there are significant harms associated with social media use,\u201d Murthy told CNN. Similar labels on tobacco, first instituted in 1965, led to a steady decline in cigarette smoking in America over the past several decades. Congress has long chastised social media companies, claiming they pose harm to children. CEOs of tech companies have been grilled routinely on Capitol Hill, most notably Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 who publicly apologized to families whose children killed themselves because of online bullying and harassment. But Congress has taken little action to curb children\u2019s social media usage. Murthy argued that it\u2019s time for Congress to get serious about curbing children\u2019s use of social media. \u201cUntil that point in time, when we have reliable evidence that tells us social media is safe and changes are being made and will be made in the future\u2026 parents deserve to be warned. That\u2019s where the label comes in,\u201d Murthy told CNN, adding that he hopes Congress will introduce legislation to add a surgeon general\u2019s warning label on social media as soon as possible. \u201cI think this is an urgent issue.\u201d An escalating battle Murthy has warned about social media\u2019s harm to children\u2019s welfare for years. But Monday\u2019s declaration of an emergency and his appeal to Congress represent his most urgent call to action on the issue so far. In May 2023, Murthy issued an advisory that said there\u2019s not enough evidence to determine whether social media is safe enough for children and adolescents\u2019 mental health, saying social media use presents \u201ca profound risk of harm\u201d for kids. He suggested parents restrict their kids\u2019 social media use, saying 13 is too young to join social apps. But such advisories are designed to call attention to urgent public health \u2013 they don\u2019t require action. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a youth mental health crisis, and I\u2019m concerned that social media is contributing to the harm that kids are experiencing,\u201d Murthy told CNN in May 2023. \u201cFor too long, we have placed the entire burden of managing social media on the shoulders of parents and kids, despite the fact that these platforms are designed by some of the most talented engineers and designers in the world to maximize the amount of time that our kids spend on them.\u201d On CNN\u2019s \u201cChasing Life\u201d podcast with Dr. Sanjay Gupta in June 2023, Murthy outlined some steps parents can take to rein in their children\u2019s social media usage, including partnering with other parents to make sure kids lack the \u201cI\u2019m the only one without social media\u201d excuse. More action needed A warning label, if Congress passes legislation requiring one, would be insufficient to fix the problem, Murthy acknowledged. He suggested schools become phone-free environments for children, as should dinner time and other family events. And Murthy urged parents to restrict children\u2019s use of social media until they graduate from middle school. Several states have worked to pass legislation to increase the age at which children can begin to use social apps or some of their more time-sucking features, such as algorithms that push people to engage with more content within the app. The bills have been largely bipartisan. Florida\u2019s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in March signed a bill that would prohibit children under 14 from obtaining their own social media accounts, and children under 16 would need parental consent to have accounts. New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul said she would sign legislation passed by the state legislature that would ban social media from using algorithms in children\u2019s feeds, and the bill would also prevent tech companies from sharing information of children under 18. \u201cThis is much easier said than done, which is why parents should work together with other families to establish shared rules, so no parents have to struggle alone or feel guilty when their teens say they are the only one who has to endure limits,\u201d Murthy wrote in the New York Times. On Monday, Murthy confirmed to CNN that alcohol and cigarettes are currently the only two products with surgeon general warning labels but that the overall health risk of social media is \u201cjust as profound.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the mental health and wellbeing of kids,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/media/surgeon-general-social-media-apps-warning-label/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_business_uk-millionaires-loss-record", "text": "A record number of millionaires could leave the United Kingdom this year as political turmoil and the potential for higher taxes under a future Labour government reduce the appeal of what was once among the top destinations for the rich. As many as 9,500 people with at least $1 million in liquid, investable assets, will leave the country, more than double the number that left in 2023, according to provisional estimates contained in a report Tuesday by migration advisers Henley & Partners. \u201cThese figures reflect a steady accumulation of factors detracting from the UK\u2019s appeal to high-net-worth individuals,\u201d Hannah White, CEO of the Institute for Government, wrote in the report. \u201cThe hangover from Brexit continues to be felt, with the City of London no longer seen as the financial center of the world.\u201d The report is based on data on 150,000 high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) tracked by investment firm New World Wealth. The firm only counts people who stay in their new country more than half of the year, and focuses primarily on company founders, chairs, CEOs, presidents, directors and managing partners. The continuing exodus from the UK \u2014 16,500 millionaires left between 2017 and 2023 \u2014 is part of a global mass migration of the rich that appears to be accelerating. The Henley Private Wealth Migration report found that 128,000 millionaires are set to relocate this year, beating last year\u2019s record by 8,000. \u201cAs the world grapples with a perfect storm of geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainty and social upheaval, millionaires are voting with their feet in record numbers,\u201d Dominic Volek, head of private clients at Henley & Partners, said in a press release. Of the 15 places with most resident millionaires, the UK is suffering more than most \u2014 only China will lose more HNWIs (15,200) in 2024 \u2014 and it\u2019s one of just three locations, alongside Japan and Hong Kong, to have seen a net loss in the decade since 2013, according to the report. By contrast, the ranks of the wealthy have grown in the US, Canada, Australia, Germany and France over the same period. The impact of Brexit, which ended the free movement of people between the UK and the European Union as well as raising new barriers to trade and investment, and other economic shocks such as the war in Ukraine and the ensuing energy price spike, has been compounded by a period of unprecedented political uncertainty. The UK has had five prime ministers since 2010, including the 45-day tenure of Liz Truss in 2022, when her plan to jack up government borrowing to slash taxes sent the pound crashing to a record low against the dollar and forced the Bank of England to intervene to prevent a financial crisis. Such instability has made it much harder for policymakers to address the country\u2019s anemic economic growth and foster a better climate for investment. Now there\u2019s a new risk on the horizon. Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour Party, which is leading Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s Conservatives by a margin of about 20% in opinion polls, has gone out of its way to woo business and investors, and to promise economic stability and stronger growth if it wins the upcoming election on July 4. Starmer and his finance spokesperson Rachel Reeves, who previously worked at the Bank of England, have promised not to increase income tax or sales tax \u2014 and to stick with fiscal rules adopted by Sunak\u2019s government. But Labour is committed to targeted tax increases that could hit the rich. It wants to remove a 20% tax break from private schools to fund new teachers in the state sector, close remaining loopholes that allow so-called non-dom residents to protect some of their foreign earnings from tax and raise more money from private equity firms. \u201cThe outflow of high-net-worth individuals already generated by the economic and political context is now being accelerated by policy decisions ahead of the election,\u201d said White. Still, one very rich couple will apparently be staying, whatever the result on July 4. Sunak, a millionaire former hedge fund manager, and his wife Akshata Murty \u2014 the daughter of an Indian tech billionaire \u2014 are worth \u00a3651 million ($826 million), according to The Sunday Times Rich List, making them richer than King Charles. Sunak said last week he would serve a full term if re-elected as member of parliament in his northern England constituency, even if his party is kicked out of government.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/business/uk-millionaires-loss-record/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_cars_berkshire-hathaway-byd-china-ev-tensions-intl-hnk", "text": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway has further cut its large stake in BYD, which vies with Tesla as the world\u2019s largest electric car (EV) maker, as global trade tensions escalate over Chinese EVs. The legendary investor\u2019s conglomerate sold another 1.35 million Hong Kong-listed shares of BYD on June 11, trimming its stake to 6.9% from 7.02%, a Hong Kong stock exchange filing showed Monday. The sale was valued at 310.5 million Hong Kong dollars ($40 million). It\u2019s the first major sale of BYD shares by Berkshire in ten months and the 14th since August 2022, when it started gradually reducing its stake in China\u2019s top EV maker. BYD shares had closed at a record high in June of that year. The latest sale comes as tensions soar over exports of cheap EVs from China. The country has become a dominant force in the global EV market, thanks to significant policy support from the government and heavy state subsidies. But a flood of cheap models has raised the specter of another trade war with its Western trading partners. Last week, the European Union hit EVs imported from China with additional tariffs because of what it sees as Beijing\u2019s unfair support for companies that undercut European carmakers. That is expected to deal a blow to the the country\u2019s manufacturers, which view Europe as a key export market. BYD will face an additional levy of 17.4% on top of the bloc\u2019s existing 10% duty on car imports, according to an announcement from the European Commission. Beijing, which has big dreams for its EV industry, has threatened to retaliate. On Monday, it announced an anti-dumping investigation into imports of pork from the EU. Tensions had previously escalated between China and the United States over the same issue. In May, the Biden administration quadrupled tariffs on EV imports from China, from 25% to 100%, aiming to boost American jobs and manufacturing. Buffett said last year that it\u2019s \u201cimperative\u201d for the US and China to settle their differences and \u201cget along with each other.\u201d \u2018Right\u2019 investment in BYD BYD, which was founded by Wang Chuanfu in Shenzhen, has had an extraordinary rise over the past three decades. It overtook Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla (TSLA) at the end of last year as the biggest seller of electric vehicles on the planet. (Tesla regained its position\u00a0in the first quarter of this year, but they\u2019re neck and neck.) In 2008, Berkshire spent $230 million in buying BYD shares at an average of HK$8 ($1.02) apiece. Back then, BYD\u2019s share price had fallen to a record low during the global financial crisis. That investment has proved to be one of the firm\u2019s most successful ever. In June 2022, the Chinese EV maker hit a record closing high of HK$331.4, about 41 times the price Berkshire had paid originally. Since then, Berkshire has been on a selling spree, with its first major sale disclosed in August 2022. So far, Berkshire has sold about 149 million shares. Berkshire has not disclosed the reason for the sales. The company didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment by CNN. Last month, Buffett mentioned BYD at Berkshire\u2019s 2024 annual meeting, crediting his closest business partner Charlie Munger, who passed away in November, for his call to buy the stock. Munger \u201cwas right, big-time,\u201d he said.

Now, the chain is hoping to replicate that success with savory new companions. Beginning Tuesday, three new 12-inch long additions are arriving, called Dippers. They use Subway\u2019s flatbread, rolled up with pepperoni and cheese, chicken and cheese or double cheese, and served hot. The $3 rollups are part of its Sidekicks menu, adding to its successful lineup of giant cookies, churros and soft pretzels. Value is a major factor in the expansion of Sidekicks. Many fast food chains are releasing new menu items and discounts to lure back cash-strapped consumers, especially\u00a0low-income consumers who are dining out less often and\u00a0spending less when they do. Sidekicks and Dippers were born out of the chain seeing younger customers\u2019 preference for snacking, according to Douglas\u00a0Fry, Subway\u2019s North America president, who said they want \u201cconvenient, hand-held, grab-and-go\u201d food at an affordable price. \u201cWe know that the economic climate has started to shift,\u201d Fry told CNN. He observed that customers have \u201cbeen sacrificing quantity and quality,\u201d and that Subway offers a \u201cgreat value proposition of great-tasting food that\u2019s made fresh and is available for a variety of budgets.\u201d Dippers are a cost-efficient addition for Subway, using existing ingredients like flatbread from its recently unveiled wraps lineup and the meats and cheeses already used in its sandwiches. Subway\u2019s\u00a0new Sidekicks lineup is a key part of its turnaround plans, which includes a number of other changes to its menus as part of its efforts to keep up with rivals. Since the January launch, Fry said the chain has sold more than 30 million snacks, priced from $2 to $5, and \u201cprobably would have sold more\u201d if it wasn\u2019t for the cookie shortage. The addition of Sidekicks \u201cmakes sense,\u201d said David Henkes, senior principal at Technomic, previously telling CNN that Subway needs to increase revenue somewhere since fast food customers have begun pushing back on price increases amid overall inflation. \u201cThey\u2019ve underperformed in\u00a0the sandwich\u00a0segment, so they need to shake things up a little bit and drive some incremental traffic,\u201d Henkes said. Technomic data shows that Subway also lags in sales for sides and snacks compared to its competitors. In recent years, Subway has added\u00a0customization to its menu, doubled down on pushing orders to its app, increased its\u00a0international presence\u00a0and introduced\u00a0freshly sliced meats\u00a0\u2014 a major shift from Subway\u2019s previous method of delivering cold cuts pre-sliced. Another major hurdle for Subway is it its dwindling store count: The chain closed more than 400 restaurants in the US in 2023, finishing the year with its smallest number of US restaurants (20,133) since 2005. Owned by Roark Capital, a privately held company, Subway doesn\u2019t regularly release financial figures. The private equity firm holds investments in a number of large restaurant chains, including Arby\u2019s, Auntie Anne\u2019s, Buffalo Wild Wings and Sonic.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/food/subway-dippers-sidekick-expansion/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_business_employer-obligations-worker-safety-heat-waves", "text": "Summer is just starting in North America, and already an intense \u201cheat dome\u201d is forecast to affect more than half the US population this week. Some areas, including Montpelier, Vermont; Syracuse, New York; and Pittsburgh, haven\u2019t seen heat like this in about three decades. Along with stifling days comes the risk of developing dangerous heat-related conditions, such as dehydration, heat stress, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and other hazards. While you can take as many measures as you like to stay cool at home, what about when you go to work? What responsibilities does your employer have to prevent you from suffering a heat-related illness? And what can you do if you think those aren\u2019t being met? Under the federal law that created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, employers always have a duty to keep your workplace free of known hazards. \u201cThis includes protecting workers from heat-related hazards,\u201d OSHA notes on its website. And it applies whether you work outdoors or indoors. While some states have specific laws governing occupational heat exposure, there is no heat-specific federal regulation mandating how employers must prevent heat illness in the workplace. But they are expected to \u201ctake reasonable action to prevent their employees from illness and death.\u201d Nor is there a specific threshold that defines \u201cextreme heat,\u201d although OSHA said it is working \u201ctowards enacting a federal heat standard that encompasses indoor and outdoor workers.\u201d The heat an employee\u2019s body experiences will depend on a lot of factors beyond the general temperature.\u00a0\u201cFor someone working outside without shade and working on cement \u2013 the heat index is going to be higher for them than [if the thermometer says] it\u2019s 85 degrees,\u201d said attorney Jason Krasno, a senior partner at Krasno, Krasno & Onwudinjo, who specializes in worker compensation cases. The same goes if someone is working in high humidity or in rooms where air circulation is poor and there is no air conditioning. Anyone required to wear a uniform that doesn\u2019t breathe may be at greater risk of overheating. And an employee\u2019s underlying chronic conditions such as asthma and heart disease may make them more vulnerable to heat risks. At minimum, your employer should take basic preventative measures All that said, both OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which research the prevention of work-related illnesses and injury, provide recommendations for employers to follow as they seek to keep workers safe on hot days. They recommend companies: Have a heat illness prevention plan. It should outline procedures, supplies and equipment necessary to prevent workers from getting a heat-related illness, as well as an emergency action plan if a worker shows signs of distress. Make water easily accessible. \u201cEncourage workers to drink at least one cup every 20 minutes, even if they are not thirsty,\u201d according to OSHA recommendations. Allow regular rest breaks. These should be in the shade or a cool area. Give employees time to acclimate. OSHA recommends the so-called \u201c20% rule.\u201d \u201cOn the first day, don\u2019t allow employees to work more than 20% of a shift at full intensity in the heat. Increase their time by no more than 20% a day until they are used to working in the heat.\u201d In a worker\u2019s first few days, the agency notes, \u201cabsolutely all symptoms should be taken seriously\u201d and workers should be allowed to stop working and get an evaluation to see if they\u2019ve developed a heat-related illness. \u201cNew employees whose bodies have not had time to adjust to working in the heat are most vulnerable \u2014 nearly 3 out of 4 workers who die from heat-related causes die in their first week on the job,\u201d OSHA notes in its Extreme Heat Hazard Alert. Encourage employees to dress for the heat. That means wearing light-colored, loose fitting, breathable clothing. Monitor workers for signs and symptoms of heat illness. These include dizziness, fainting, nausea and muscle spasms. Also, do verbal checks frequently with workers who are wearing face coverings or wearing face equipment like a respirator. Managers should encourage employees to do the same for themselves and their coworkers. Should any signs appear, try to cool the worker down and \u201cwhen in doubt, call 911,\u201d OSHA recommends. Change work hours. Another OSHA-recommended accommodation employers may make when feasible is to alter employees\u2019 working hours so that they work primarily during the coolest parts of a day \u2014 such as very early morning or after the sun goes down, said attorney Alka Ramchandani-Raj, who is co-chair of\u00a0the occupational safety and health practice group at Littler, a law firm representing employers in employment law and labor practice issues. What you can do To find out more about your particular employer\u2019s obligations and commitment to providing a healthy workplace, first check the company\u2019s safety handbook to see what recommendations they build into their policies and what the best way is to alert managers about potentially unsafe working conditions, Ramchandani-Raj noted. Next, check to see which rules and recommendations your employer should be following in the state where you work. While more than 20 states are subject to federal OSHA requirements, which establish the most basic obligations of most US employers, your particular state may have its own OSHA-like agency that establishes more stringent rules. If you suspect your employer is not providing a healthy workplace, you can file a confidential complaint with OSHA either by calling 800-321-OSHA or filing online. \u201cYou have the right to speak up about hazards\u00a0without fear of retaliation,\u201d OSHA notes. The agency also noted that it \u201cis planning enhanced enforcement actions, with a strategic focus on geographic locations and industries where high heat impacts vulnerable worker populations.\u201d Translation: More inspection activity and greater enforcement. And, it added, \u201cOSHA will also be providing outreach and compliance assistance to ensure employers, including those not covered by the OSH Act, and worker organizations have the tools to protect workers from hazardous heat.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/business/employer-obligations-worker-safety-heat-waves/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_media_tucker-carlson-ticketmaster-tour", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Ticketmaster\u00a0is linking arms with right-wing extremists, boosting their ability to reach mainstream audiences and profiting off their dangerous and hateful rhetoric ahead of the November election. The ticketing sales giant is the distributor of the forthcoming live speaking tour from\u00a0Tucker Carlson,\u00a0who announced plans this week to crisscross the country with a 15-city arena tour, inviting fellow conspiracy theorists such as\u00a0Alex Jones\u00a0and\u00a0Marjorie Taylor Greene\u00a0to join him along the way. On the Ticketmaster website, Carlson is referred to as \u201cthe leading voice in American politics\u201d and \u201can alternative to corporate media dedicated to telling the truth about the things that matter \u2014 clearly and without fear.\u201d While it is hard to imagine that Ticketmaster conjured this glowing description of Carlson itself, it is remarkable the company would approve it and promote it on its site. That is because there is not a morsel of truth to how Ticketmaster is presenting Carlson to its customers. Carlson, a former mainstream conservative who over the course of\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0presidency traveled to the fringes of American politics, has for years promoted dangerous disinformation and damaging conspiracy theories. Carlson lied about the Covid-19 vaccines, discouraging his fans from receiving the life-saving shots. He sowed doubt about the legitimacy of the 2020 election, suggesting that it was rigged by sinister forces against Trump. And he reprehensibly peddled the false notion that the January 6 insurrection was a so-called \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation staged by the \u201cdeep state.\u201d In addition to those corrosive lies, Carlson has been one of the top promoters of the\u00a0Great Replacement Theory, the idea favored by White supremacists that falsely accuses the\u00a0Democratic Party\u00a0and wealthy Jewish figures, such as\u00a0George Soros, of importing third-world migrants into the U.S. to shift the country\u2019s demographics to win elections. For his repugnant promotion of such lies,\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0noted that\u00a0while Carlson was at Fox News, he \u201cconstructed what may be the most racist show in the history of cable news.\u201d Ultimately, Carlson grew to be too much of a problem even for\u00a0Fox News, and the\u00a0Rupert Murdoch-controlled right-wing channel dispensed of him last year. Evidently, Fox News has higher standards for whom they will do business with than Ticketmaster, a remarkably low bar for the events giant to trip over. Asked for comment this week, representatives for the Live Nation subsidiary chose not to respond. In fairness to the company\u2019s public relations division, it is difficult to see how they can defend such conduct. How can any decent person not only participate in enabling Carlson\u2019s poisoning of the public discourse but also justify profiting off of his hateful rhetoric in the process? CNN also posed questions to the venues hosting Carlson, which include the\u00a0Honda Center,\u00a0T-Mobile Center,\u00a0Delta Center,\u00a0Dickies Arena,\u00a0Intrust Bank Arena and others. Spokespeople representing each respective venue did not provide a comment. These are uneasy questions that major businesses will be confronted with in the years ahead as the\u00a0Republican Party\u00a0veers further and further toward the fringe. Far-right and conspiratorial figures like Jones, the founder of\u00a0Infowars\u00a0who openly fantasized this week about executing\u00a0Dr. Anthony Fauci\u00a0and other Trump critics, were once banished to the shadows of the conservative movement, mocked by people like Carlson. Now, Carlson and others openly celebrate Jones, fully aligning themselves to assail the nation\u2019s institutions. Companies with basic ethics should, of course, reject doing business with dishonest figures who profit by dumping toxic waste into the country\u2019s information environment. But doing so puts them at risk of being targeted by those very same people who, like Trump, have tremendous sway over the vast majority of Republicans and a lightning rod for painful boycotts. But, while the politics of 2024 makes for a thorny business environment for companies to navigate, from an ethics perspective, the questions that lie before them come with clear and obvious answers. Those uncomfortable decisions risk catapulting them squarely into the center of the information wars, where grifters like Carlson thrive.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/media/tucker-carlson-ticketmaster-tour/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/19/2024", "section": "business"}}
