{"id": "2024_07_02_business_ftc-sealy-mattress-firm-merger", "text": "The Federal Trade Commission unanimously voted to block mattress maker Tempur Sealy\u2019s purchase of Mattress Firm on Tuesday. In May 2023, Tempur Sealy \u2013 the world\u2019s largest mattress supplier and manufacturer \u2013 agreed to buy the United States\u2019 largest bedding retailer in a roughly $4 billion deal. The FTC authorized a lawsuit in federal court to block the acquisition. The Commission said that the proposed deal would suppress competition and raise prices for mattress buyers, and give the companies \u201cenormous power\u201d in the mattress supply chain. The FTC also said that documents showed that competing mattress suppliers would lose access to its most important retail channel. These suppliers employ thousands of American workers, it said. \u201cThrough emails, presentations, and other deal documents, Tempur Sealy has made it abundantly clear that its acquisition of Mattress Firm is intended to kneecap competitors and dominate the market,\u201d said Henry Liu, Director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition in a press release. \u201cThis deal isn\u2019t about creating efficiencies; it\u2019s about crippling the competition, which would raise prices on an essential good and could lead to layoffs for good paying American manufacturing jobs in nearly a dozen states.\u201d The deal would have given the combined company 3,000 stores and 71 manufacturing facilities and was expected to close in the second half of 2024. Tempur Sealy\u2019s portfolio includes Tempur-Pedic, Sealy and Stearns and Foster. The deal was seen as beneficial for both parties by analysts, because mattress and furniture sales\u00a0have slowed following a pandemic-induced high, when consumers splurged heavily on home furnishings. Mattress Firm was already dealing with its own financial issues,\u00a0including a 2018 bankruptcy.\u00a0The retailer struggled with over-expansion and online competitors, including Casper and Amazon. The FTC alleges that the reduced competition in the premium mattress space would harm the substantial portion of those mattress buyers \u2013 \u201cworking class, older adults\u201d who often rely on financing. The purchase could drive rivals, which include Serta Simmons Bedding and Purple Innovation, Inc., out of business, the FTC warned. \u201cFor example, the combined firm could limit present and future rivals\u2019 access to Mattress Firm\u2019s floor space, award sales associates higher commissions on Tempur Sealy products sold, or otherwise take steps designed to steer customers away from competitors\u2019 products and toward Tempur Sealy\u2019s mattresses,\u201d the FTC said. In a statement, Tempur Sealy said the bedding industry is \u201chighly competitive\u201d and only a small fraction of brick-and-mortar storefronts are Mattress Firms. It also said it believes a litigation process will be complete in the next few months, and it still expects to close the transaction in late 2024 or early 2025. \u201cTempur Sealy has been working constructively with the FTC to secure regulatory approval for this transaction and is disappointed that the FTC has initiated litigation. We appreciate their efforts to understand the industry and the proposed transaction, but ultimately believe the FTC\u2019s perspective does not reflect all the relevant facts and law,\u201d the statement said. Mattress Firm similarly said it was disappointed in a statement, and said it \u201ccontinues to believe that the transaction with Tempur Sealy will be beneficial to consumers and employees as well as the overall bedding and furniture industry.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context. CNN\u2019s Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report. Correction: A previous story misstated the Tempur Sealy portfolio. It includes Tempur-Pedic, Sealy and Stearns and Foster.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/business/ftc-sealy-mattress-firm-merger/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_business_noncompete-clause-federal-judge-ruling", "text": "A federal judge on Wednesday preliminarily delayed a ban on noncompete agreements from taking effect for a handful of employers on September 4. Unless the judge makes another ruling to the contrary before that date, the ban on noncompete agreements will go into effect for the majority of companies in the US. But they will learn later this summer if that still holds.  \u201cWhile this order is preliminary, the Court intends to rule on the ultimate merits of this action on or before August 30, 2024,\u201d wrote Judge Ada Brown of the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas. There is likely to be a concerted effort between now and the end of August to persuade the judge to block the ban nationwide, according to Jesse Coleman, a partner at the law firm Seyfarth Shaw in Houston, which represents SHRM, a human resource management association. The ban, which prohibits employers from enforcing noncompete clauses in most existing employment agreements and bans companies from including them in all future ones, was approved by the Federal Trade Commission in April. Within a day of the FTC approval, the agency was sued by Ryan LLC, a tax services and software provider based in Texas, and, separately, by the US Chamber of Commerce and other business groups. Wednesday\u2019s order limits the preliminary injunction to just the plaintiff (Ryan LLC) and the plaintiffs-intervenors, which are the US Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, the Texas Association of Business and the Longview Chamber of Commerce. However, it doesn\u2019t extend to the member companies of those groups. \u201c[T]he Court declines to extend injunctive relief to members of Plaintiff-Intervenors,\u201d the judge wrote. Even though the court indicates that it believes the FTC lacks the rulemaking authority to issue a noncompete ban, the judge declined to issue a nationwide ban for now, Coleman said.  Part of the reason, according to the order, appears to be that the plaintiffs-intervenors did not sufficiently brief the court on why a ban should be applied more widely. The FTC estimates that 30 million people \u2014 one in five US workers \u2014 are bound by a noncompete clause in their current jobs. For most of them, the agency asserts that such a clause restricts them from freely switching jobs, lowers wages, stifles innovation, blocks entrepreneurs from starting new businesses and undermines fair competition. The US Chamber of Commerce, in a statement, characterized the limited preliminary injunction as a win. \u201cThe FTC\u2019s blanket ban on noncompetes is an unlawful power grab that defies the agency\u2019s constitutional and statutory authority and sets a dangerous precedent where the government knows better than the markets. The U.S. Chamber will continue to hold the FTC accountable in court,\u201d said the group\u2019s chief counsel Daryl Joseffer. In response to the order, FTC spokesperson Douglas Farrar said, \u201cThe FTC stands by our clear authority, supported by statute and precedent, to issue this rule. We will keep fighting to free hardworking Americans from unlawful noncompetes, which reduce innovation, inhibit economic growth, trap workers, and undermine Americans\u2019 economic liberty.\u201d In the meantime, the court\u2019s order does not preclude the FTC from taking enforcement actions against noncompete agreements on a case-by-case basis.

For the last several months the runway has been closed overnight for a taxiway construction project, and it reopens each morning at 5:45 a.m., according to the Portland International Jetport.

{"id": "2024_04_23_cars_electric-vehicle-sales-forecast-iea", "text": "Global electric vehicle sales are set to rise by more than a fifth to reach 17 million this year, powered by drivers in China, according to the International Energy Agency. In a report Tuesday, the IEA projected that \u201csurging demand\u201d for EVs over the next decade was set \u201cto remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport.\u201d It expects half of all cars sold globally to be electric by 2035, up from more than one in five this year, provided charging infrastructure keeps pace. The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs. The agency\u2019s bullish long-term outlook for EVs \u2014 based on current government policies \u2014 comes just days after the world\u2019s biggest battery EV maker Tesla slashed its prices in major markets to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers. Recent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The data \u201cdoes not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars. It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday. The growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers. The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union rose almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. In a statement, Birol said: \u201cRather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.\u201d Despite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats. In the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the world\u2019s biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States. Earlier this month, Tesla posted its first annual drop in sales in nearly four years. The company\u2019s stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year. China\u2019s BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023. Automakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the \u201cpace of the transition to EVs\u2026 will hinge on affordability.\u201d In China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average. \u201cIntensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,\u201d the IEA said. \u201cGrowing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,\u201d it added. Last year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market. \u201cChina is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,\u201d Birol said. Concerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an investigation late last year into China\u2019s state support for EV makers. The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the region\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW. EV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country. By 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA. That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year. \u201cThis shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,\u201d Birol said. The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector. In addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States. Under current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA.

{"id": "2024_07_02_media_biden-mental-fitness", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s White House repeatedly and aggressively shot down reports\u00a0on\u00a0the president\u2019s age and any possible limitations\u00a0on his ability to perform all the duties of his office. But after his shaky debate performance last week, in which Biden routinely struggled to\u00a0get his point across, some in the White House press corps say they wish they had pushed harder to tell the story. In June, when the Wall Street Journal published a\u00a0lengthy piece\u00a0on President Joe Biden\u2019s mental\u00a0state, the newspaper\u00a0got\u00a0slammed.\u00a0The White House, its allies, and\u00a0some in the media\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources\u00a0\u2013\u00a0criticized the Journal for quoting mostly Republican political foes on the record, who had a clear political motive to damage Biden\u2019s image. No Democrats were quoted on the record making those allegations, and several Democrats complained their on-the-record quotes praising Biden\u2019s sharpness were not included. The\u00a0Journal defended its reporting at the time. Last week\u2019s debate on CNN laid bare many of the concerns the Journal\u2019s reporting had raised \u2013 that the president has good days and bad days but can sometimes seem to slip up. A New York Times report on Tuesday raised similar concerns by those who have recently been in the room with Biden. The Times reported Biden has more frequent \u201clapses,\u201d although at other times he appears sharp. After Biden\u2019s lackluster performance last week, some are questioning whether the White House press corps dropped the ball on fully covering Biden\u2019s limitations. Biden\u2019s\u00a0age issue is not secret or new. Nearly every media outlet has reported on\u00a0growing concerns about\u00a0Biden\u2019s age well before the debate. The White House in the past has complained that the coverage is disproportionate, and that the media is spending more time covering Biden\u2019s age than his accomplishments as president versus former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies. The media has faced accusations that it has not covered Biden\u2019s mental fitness more aggressively because it wants to prop up the campaign in some way \u2013 an accusation the White House reporters CNN spoke to denied. Several White House reporters\u00a0told CNN that\u00a0the\u00a0coverage\u00a0of Biden\u2019s age and his mental stamina\u00a0should have\u00a0pushed harder. They cited several difficulties in doing so before the debate \u2013 from the obvious political motivations of sources who either want to protect Biden\u2019s image or project a certain image, to the blowback from pursuing such reports, especially from the White House and Democrats. A difficult task Like all past presidents, Biden has good days and bad days. It\u00a0can be tricky to report on something as difficult to define as a person aging, when his opponent\u00a0is a convicted felon, who regularly lies and has threatened to use the government to go after his political opponents. Still, some reporters said the press corps\u00a0could\u00a0have done a better job\u00a0covering\u00a0Biden\u2019s physical and mental state. The failure of the media, one White House reporter said,\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0pushing more aggressively\u00a0into Biden\u2019s abilities after the release of the Robert Hurr report in February, which called Biden a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d Biden\u2019s age was also a right-wing talking point for years, something the White House was quick to point out to reporters,\u00a0which\u00a0may have inadvertently turned off any serious investigation. For example, deceptively edited clips of Biden from the G7 spread widely by right-wing media figures were made to seem as though he was aimlessly \u201cwandering off\u201d from fellow world leaders when really, he was speaking to parachutists who had just landed during a demonstration. \u201cThe right-wing media was calling him senile from day one, and that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cThen whenever you report on the age you were in some ways solidifying, giving credence to some people that were actually of bad faith.\u201d All the White House reporters who spoke to CNN for this piece chose to speak anonymously so they could speak more freely about their relationship with the White House. Keeping the president at a distance Reporters said the White House has not made the press corps\u2019 job easy:\u00a0The White House has put up guardrails around Biden, they say, and\u00a0he does not engage in as many interviews or planned press conferences\u00a0as previous presidents. At those events,\u00a0the press might be able to gauge how he\u2019s doing on the spot, without prepared remarks. \u201cThey keep him at arm\u2019s length, and he rarely does extended interviews,\u201d the reporter said of the White House,\u00a0although he acknowledged Biden has started giving more interviews as of late. Biden has done fewer interviews and formal press conferences than his most recent predecessors, according to data compiled by\u00a0Martha Joynt Kumar,\u00a0professor emerita of political science at Towson University who chronicles the presidents\u2019 interactions with the press. But on quick and informal interactions with the press, like shouted questions on the way to his helicopter or plane, Biden\u00a0as of this week has had 588 interactions, Kumar reports, second only to Trump when compared to recent presidents. But those interactions are not the same as an extended press conference, reporters noted. On Tuesday, ABC News announced Biden would sit down with George Stephanopoulos for an interview, his first since the debate. The White House press shop has also been very \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cfairly successful\u201d in mitigating coverage of concerns over the president\u2019s age,\u00a0said\u00a0another White House reporter who works for a different publication. \u201c[B]erating reporters who bring them reporting about age concerns, bemoaning that it\u2019s all anyone writes about (clearly, it\u2019s not) and often attacking pieces after they run,\u201d the reporter told CNN. \u201cI think that\u2019s left some folks to conclude that these stories are too painful to report or that they should pick their spots more. It\u2019s clear the age stories that have angered the White House (and the liberal Twittersphere) the most.\u201d Alex Thompson, a White House reporter for Axios, said on CNN the day after the debate that \u201cthe White House\u2019s response every single time\u00a0it\u00a0has come up for three-and-a-half years has been to deflect, to gaslight, to not tell the truth \u2013 not just to reporters, not just to other Democrats, but even at times to themselves about the president\u2019s limitations at his age.\u201d Still, this White House\u2019s recent conduct with reporters pales in comparison to Trump\u2019s team, which has done everything from revoking press access to reporters they disagree with, to calling reporters the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d The White House declined to comment. Aging doesn\u2019t happen all at once Aging is also not a sudden moment.\u00a0That makes it trickier to report on. \u201cTo some extent, the decline has appeared to be gradual \u2014 hard to notice from day to day \u2014 and that\u2019s perhaps made it harder for reporters to determine when is the right moment to write something,\u201d one of the reporters said. Just a few days before the debate, Biden held a press conference at the G7 alongside Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelensky that passed off without anything of note in Biden\u2019s demeanor. But reporters pointed out (and have published stories noting) that the president has been using teleprompters at most big events, even fundraisers where in the past he might not have. He has also started to use the lower stairs to board Air Force One. Last year, The New York Times published a lengthy piece on the \u201ccomplicated reality of America\u2019s oldest president,\u201d which looked at some of those accommodations and concerns for his age, but also the moments where he showed stamina and vigor. Some reporters said that there has been a distinct change\u00a0within the last year, and that the press corps should have reported more aggressively on the accommodations made for the president. \u201cI think the press, most of the White House press, did suffer from a bit of lack of curiosity,\u201d one of the reporters said. Look who you\u2019re up against Biden\u2019s allies will often question coverage of the president\u2019s age, questioning why reporters focus on the president\u2019s age and mental lucidity and not on Trump\u2019s\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who, at 78,\u00a0was observed falling asleep during his hush money trial, has made his own major verbal flubs and bizarre statements, and regularly spouts complete falsehoods. \u201cIt makes sense to reflect on this now and ask whether we missed or, really, under-reported the story of Biden\u2019s age and decline. But it\u2019s complicated,\u201d one of the reporters said. \u201cThe fact that the political alternative to Biden is an authoritarian who sparked an insurrection and is a convicted felon does not mean that the press is failing American democracy to focus on Biden\u2019s obvious frailty.\u201d One of the reporters said the media can, and do, report on both. Biden\u2019s allies, however, say too much attention is placed on Biden\u2019s age and not on the threat Trump could pose to American democracy. But the reporters say they can, and should, do both. \u201cJust because you are reporting on Biden age, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not reporting on Trump\u2019s lies.\u00a0 I find that argument silly, and it seems one design towards like producing a certain outcome in the election, rather than like an honest reporting,\u201d one of the reporters said. The outlets that had received harsh blowback for their previous reports on Biden\u2019s lucidity now feel justified. A source familiar with the staff behind the Wall Street Journal\u2019s report said that when the piece first published, the reporters were approached by people with sympathy asking how they\u2019re doing \u201cas if something terrible had just happened,\u201d the source said. After the debate, the reporters started to get messages saying they were right.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/media/biden-mental-fitness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}

NBC announced on Wednesday it will use AI software to recreate Michaels\u2019 voice to deliver daily recaps of the Summer Games for subscribers of its Peacock streaming platform, a milestone for the use of AI by a major media company. The use of an AI voice for the Olympics comes as the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, sound and text. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries, such as journalism, about how artificial intelligence can \u2013 or even should \u2013 be used. A new tool, called \u201cYour Daily Olympic Recap on Peacock,\u201d will enable 10-minute highlights packages, which can include events updates, athlete back stories and other related content personalized by subscriber preferences. The company said the highlights could be packaged in about 7 million different ways, pulled from 5,000 hours of live coverage in Paris, effectively making AI (the artificial intelligence, not the man) a significantly more efficient way to deliver personalized recaps.  \u201cWhen I was approached about this, I was skeptical but obviously curious,\u201d Michaels said in a press release. \u201cThen I saw a demonstration detailing what they had in mind. I said, \u2018I\u2019m in.\u2019\u201d A NBC spokesperson told CNN Michaels is being compensated for his involvement.

He\u2019s also known for his work on previous Olympics Games broadcasts for both NBC and ABC and for calling the Miracle on Ice Game at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. NBC said the AI system was trained using prior NBC broadcast audio from Michaels. The company said a team of NBC Sports editors will review all of the content, including audio and clips, to make sure everything is factually accurate and names are pronounced correctly.

{"id": "2024_06_29_business_boeing-criminal-charges-implications", "text": "Criminal charges against a corporation, like the ones the Justice Department is considering bringing against Boeing, would be a serious blow, worsening the company\u2019s already precarious financial situation and further damaging its battered reputation. But it wouldn\u2019t necessarily result in past or current executives facing prison time. While criminal charges against corporations are fairly common, the overwhelming majority are against small, closely-held companies. They aren\u2019t brought nearly as often against publicly-traded companies, let alone those in the Dow Jones Industrial Average\u2019s index of the nation\u2019s 30 most important companies. And despite the fact that almost all illegal actions on behalf of a company are committed by individuals, not the company itself, it\u2019s rare for top executives - especially at larger companies - to face personal punishment. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to convict that person,\u201d said Jennifer Arlen, law professor and director of the program on corporate compliance and enforcement at New York University. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t need to name them.\u201d At a smaller, closely held company where the owner is the only employee who would face criminal charges, the owner might be more willing to have the company take the hit. That\u2019s even if it means going out of business due to an unaffordable fine, rather than to charges themselves, Arlen said. But at a major public company with thousands of employees, those top executives making decisions might agree to a settlement that leads to criminal charges for lower level individuals. But they\u2019re unlikely to reach a settlement in which they face criminal prosecution themselves. But even without any individuals facing prison time, criminal charges have serious enough implications that no publicly traded company wants to have that on its record, Arlen said. That\u2019s why they typically seek civil, not criminal settlements, as Boeing has done numerous times in just the past few years. Two examples are when it faced charges of violating the Arms Export Control Act, which involved the alleged downloading of sensitive military secrets by unauthorized employees in China, or the False Claims Act, which involved allegations of fraudulent billing on government contracts. Boeing paid tens of millions in fines in recent cases involving those violation, but they were civil settlements, not criminal. The civil settlement can allow the company to say it has never been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a felony, and thus not have to worry about the legal implications that go with that being on a company\u2019s record. \u201cNo major publicly held firm wants to be convicted of a felony,\u201d Arlen said. \u201cThat\u2019s why companies will try to negotiate for something else.\u201d The company can also reach agreements to defer prosecution, which means the company is essentially given a probationary period after which the threat of prosecution goes away. That\u2019s what Boeing did in January 2021 to settle allegations it defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration when it was seeking certification of the 737 Max. Earlier criminal settlement now at risk The potential charges hanging over Boeing currently revolve around that January 2021 deferred prosecution agreement. The government alleged at that time, and Boeing agreed to in its settlement, that it had provided \u201cmisleading statements, half-truths, and omissions\u201d to the FAA about a feature in its 737 Max jets when seeking certification for it to carry passengers. That feature, and the lack of information Boeing provided about potential problems, were found to be the cause of two fatal crashes of the plane in 2018 and 2019 that killed a total of 346 people. \u201cThe tragic crashes\u2026 exposed fraudulent and deceptive conduct by employees of one of the world\u2019s leading commercial airplane manufacturers,\u201d acting Assistant Attorney General David Burns said at the time of the settlement. \u201cBoeing\u2019s employees chose the path of profit over candor by concealing material information from the FAA concerning the operation of its 737 Max airplane and engaging in an effort to cover up their deception.\u201d But family members of the crash victims criticized the deal as letting Boeing off too lightly. They have argued Boeing should face new criminal charges and pay a fine as great as $24.9 billion. Boeing was given a three-year period as part of the settlement to prove to the government that it had changed its behavior, after which it no longer would face the potential of criminal charges over the fraud. But days before that period was due to end, a door plug blew off a Boeing 737 Max jet as the plane, with passengers aboard and flown by Alaska Airlines, approached 16,000 feet. That opened the door to possible prosecution on the earlier charges. In May, the Justice Department said it was looking into bringing criminal charges against Boeing once again due to a potential violation of that January 2021 agreement. Prosecutors in the DOJ are urging that charges be filed against Boeing, a source familiar with the case has told CNN. Boeing has argued in its own court filings that it did not violate the agreement and that it should be spared prosecution. No individual \u2013 neither the lower-level employees alleged to have provided false information to the FAA, or the top executives of Boeing \u2013 were charged with a crime as part of the settlement. One former employee, Mark Forkner, Boeing\u2019s chief technical pilot at the time, allegedly provided some of the false information and was later indicted. His attorneys argued that he was made a scapegoat by Boeing, and he was later found not guilty. Big dollars at stake Oil company BP agreed to pay $4 billion in penalties to settle criminal charges, including felony manslaughter charges, related to the explosion and oil spill at its Deepwater Horizon oil platform in 2010. It paid more than $60 billion in other legal settlements related to the accident. Volkswagen pleaded guilty to three US felony criminal charges and agreed to pay $4.3 billion in criminal and civil penalties in 2017 related to the emissions scandal, in which it cheated emissions tests done on its diesel cars by the US Environmental Protection Agency. By contrast, Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion as part of the January 2021 settlement, but $1.8 billion of that was money it had already agreed to pay to its airline customers as compensation for the 20-month grounding of the planes. The criminal fine paid to the government came to only $244 million, with an additional $500 million set aside to compensate family members of victims. So there would be serious implications for Boeing with new criminal charges, even if it were to reach a new settlement that defers prosecution once again. It could face significantly larger fines than the ones it already agreed to pay, fines that could easily stretch into the billions \u2013 if not tens of billions \u2013 if crash victim families get their way. That could force Boeing\u2019s debt rating into junk bond status for the first time in its history, significantly raising its borrowing costs and worsening its already precarious financial situation. At the end of the first quarter it had just less than $7 billion in cash on hand, and nearly $47 billion in long-term debt. A possible corporate death sentence There\u2019s a good chance, according to Arlen and other experts, that Boeing ends up having a federal monitor oversee how it conducts business. \u201cFirms don\u2019t like a monitor,\u201d Arlen said. \u201cBut Boeing has some pretty significant quality control problems.\u201d Pleading guilty to criminal charges rather than again deferring prosecution could result in restrictions on doing business in some countries that have prohibitions on companies found guilty of a felony, Arlen said. In the most extreme scenario it could be blocked from conducting business with the federal government, a highly unlikely or impossible scenario. Such a prohibition, while theoretically possible, would be a death sentence for a company that gets 37% of its revenue from US government contracts. Besides the disruption to the American economy that Boeing\u2019s disappearance would cause, it would also deprive the federal government of many of the defense aircraft, rockets and satellites that it gets from Boeing, as well as crippling plans for most of the nation\u2019s airlines to get the planes and parts they need. Arlen said it is common for smaller companies to be forced out of business by criminal charges and the penalties that follow. It\u2019s less common for larger businesses. But it can happen in the health care sector, where a criminal charge can lead to a company not being able to do business with Medicare or Medicaid. Perhaps the most famous company forced out of business by criminal charges was accounting firm Arthur Andersen, once one of the nation\u2019s \u201cBig Five\u201d accounting firms that audited the books of major publicly-traded companies. which was found guilty by a jury in 2002 of obstruction of justice for destroying records of its client Enron, after it had been notified of a federal investigation. The Supreme Court later unanimously overturned that conviction, ruling that \u201cjury instructions at issue simply failed to convey the requisite consciousness of wrongdoing.\u201d But by the time of that victory in 2005, the conviction had essentially forced the firm out of business.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/business/boeing-criminal-charges-implications/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_tech_meta-eu-competition-rules", "text": "Facebook parent Meta has been accused of breaking Europe\u2019s new digital competition rules over its \u201cpay or consent\u201d advertising model. Late last year, Meta (META)\u00a0launched\u00a0a service called \u201cSubscription for no ads,\u201d allowing European users of Facebook and Instagram to pay up to \u20ac12.99 ($14) a month for ad-free versions. The alternative is to accept versions with personalized ads. The European Commission said in a statement Monday that, in its preliminary view, \u201cthis binary choice forces users to consent to the (use) of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalized but equivalent version of Meta\u2019s social networks.\u201d If the provisional findings of the Commission\u2019s investigation are confirmed, the EU could hit Meta with a fine equivalent to 10% of its global annual revenue under its landmark Digital Markets Act. Based on the company\u2019s 2023 results, that would amount to $13.5 billion. Meta said it didn\u2019t accept the Commission\u2019s findings. \u201c\u2019Subscription for no ads\u2019 follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.\u201d The EU announcement comes a week after the Commission accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the DMA by preventing app developers from freely directing consumers to cheaper services. The regulators are also investigating Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) under the new law. The DMA, which came into force in March, requires dominant online platforms \u2014 so-called gatekeepers \u2014 to give users more choice, and rivals more opportunities to compete. Online platforms often collect personal data across their own and third-party services and use it in digital advertising services. Margrethe Vestager, a European Commissioner in charge of competition policy, noted in Monday\u2019s statement that Meta had been accumulating personal data of \u201cmillions of EU citizens over many years.\u201d \u201cWe want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalized ads experience,\u201d she said. Michael Koenig, a senior official at the Commission, said Meta must offer users an alternative to \u201cfull\u201d ad personalization that \u201cdoes not rely on this personal data and which is then automatically less personalized and still available to them.\u201d \u201cThen Meta is free to keep a third option, which is a subscription not to see ads at all, or a fourth option which may have some premium features,\u201d he told journalists. The Commission is due to conclude its probe into Meta by late March next year.

{"id": "2024_07_03_business_china-bond-market-bank-crisis-svb-intl-hnk", "text": "Money is rushing into Chinese government bonds, sending their prices soaring and yields plunging to record lows as investors hunt for a safer alternative to the country\u2019s ravaged real estate market and volatile stocks. The yield on China\u2019s onshore 10-year government bond, which is a benchmark for a wide range of interest rates, touched 2.18% Monday, the lowest since 2002 when records began. Yields on 20-year and 30-year bonds are also hovering around historic lows. Bond yields, or the returns offered to investors for holding them, fall as prices rise. Lower borrowing costs should be welcome in an economy struggling to recover from a property crash, sluggish consumer spending and weak business confidence. But the sharp move in bonds is sparking talk of a bubble and triggering acute anxiety among China\u2019s policymakers, who fear a crisis similar to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) last year. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) has issued over 10 separate warnings since April about the risk that a bond bubble could burst, destabilizing financial markets and derailing the Chinese economy\u2019s uneven recovery. Now it\u2019s doing something unprecedented \u2014borrowing bonds to sell them to tamp down prices. \u201cSVB in the United States has taught us that the central bank needs to observe and evaluate the situation of the financial market from a macro-prudential perspective,\u201d PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng said at a financial forum in Shanghai late last month. \u201cAt present, we must pay close attention to the maturity mismatch and interest rate risks associated with the large holdings of medium and long-term bonds by some non-bank entities,\u201d the central bank governor added. Those entities include insurance companies, investment funds and other financial firms. Lessons from the US SVB was the biggest US bank failure since the global financial crisis. The roots of its demise lay in the fact that SVB had ploughed billions into US government bonds, an apparently safe bet that came unstuck when the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates to tame inflation. Prices of the bonds SVB was holding fell, eroding its finances. Policymakers in China fear the risk of a similar crisis in the world\u2019s second largest economy if the bond frenzy goes unchecked. Prices of Chinese bonds have risen fast since early this year as investors pile into them because of the uncertain economic outlook. Businesses are also borrowing less, leaving banks with excess cash they have to park somewhere. \u201cCredit demand is weak due to the property woes. As a result, banks have to buy more bonds as money is trapped in the interbank market,\u201d said Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group. A \u201cdeflationary outlook\u201d for the economy has also taken hold among investors, prompting them to flock to long-term sovereign bonds, he added. Similar to SVB, China\u2019s financial institutions have invested a significant amount in long-term government bonds, which make them vulnerable to sudden interest rate changes. Beijing is concerned that if the bond bubble pops, sending prices down and yields up, those lenders could suffer big losses. \u201cWhat worries policymakers is the interest rate risk, which will rise once the dominant narrative shifts from deflation to reflation,\u201d Hu from Macquarie said.  In the first half of this year, net purchases of sovereign bonds by financial institutions, mostly by regional banks, were 1.55 trillion yuan ($210 billion), up 61% from the same period last year, according to an analysis of central bank data by Zheshang Securities, a state-controlled brokerage firm. Official interest rates in China are low after cuts in recent years by the PBOC aimed at supporting the economy. Deflationary pressures have persisted \u2014 consumer prices rose less than expected in May and factory prices declined for the 20th month in a row. But \u201conce external demand slows, Beijing will have to step up stimulus to achieve its (economic) growth target,\u201d Hu said. If that happens, bond yields will rise as investors switch back into riskier stocks. Meanwhile, demand for credit should rise, banks will lend more and therefore reduce their holdings of government debt. This will cause the bond bull market to reverse, Hu said. The country\u2019s \u201c4,000 or so small and medium-sized banks\u201d will be particularly vulnerable to the interest rate risk, he added. Cooling the frenzy In a sign of growing concerns, the PBOC said Monday it would intervene directly in the bond market to cool the frenzy for \u201cthe first time in history,\u201d according to state media. The central bank will borrow government bonds from traders on the open market, so that it can sell them in a bid to depress prices and boost yields. The decision was made after \u201ccareful observation and assessment\u201d and was intended to \u201cmaintain the sound operation of the bond market,\u201d the PBOC added. Chinese state media outlets are also sounding the alarm. The state-owned Securities Times warned Tuesday about the risks of a bond market bubble, calling out the case of SVB and a Japanese bank whose holdings of US and European government debt have lost value as yields have risen. \u201cThe bubble formed by the rush of funds into the bond market is accumulating interest rate risks,\u201d the Securities Times said in an editorial. \u201cThe \u2018triggers\u2019 for the bankruptcy of SVB and the huge losses of Japan\u2019s Norinchukin\u00a0Bank were all interest rate risks caused by their over-reliance on bond investment.\u201d The repeated verbal warnings have so far failed to rein in soaring bond prices. Hence this week\u2019s market intervention. Monday\u2019s move \u201cdemonstrates the PBOC\u2019s determination\u201d to cool the rally by selling bonds and lifting yields, said Zhang Jiqiang, chief fixed-income analyst at Huatai Securities. \u201cThe central bank wants to avoid an SVB-style crisis,\u201d he said. Economic risks The rapid decline in Chinese bond yields also poses significant risks to the economy. \u201cLow government bond yields do more harm than good to the economy in the current circumstance,\u201d said Ken Cheung, director of foreign exchange strategy at Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong. That\u2019s because they could reinforce market expectations for aggressive interest rate cuts by the PBOC and weak growth, exacerbating the formation of \u201cdeflation mindset,\u201d he said. In addition, the bond market frenzy may counteract the PBOC\u2019s efforts to boost economic activity and increase money supply, as it encourages capital to flow into the bond market,\u00a0rather than going to riskier assets such as stocks, property, and other investments that drive economic growth. The decline in Chinese government bond yields could also widen the interest rate spread between the US and China, causing money to flee the world\u2019s second largest economy and heaping pressure on the yuan. \u201cChina\u2019s capital outflows in April reached the highest level since Jan 2016, largely due to the widening US-China yield gap,\u201d Hu said. \u201cTherefore, the PBOC doesn\u2019t want to see interest rates fall too quickly.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/business/china-bond-market-bank-crisis-svb-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_business_boeing-ntsb-violation-absurdity", "text": "If you\u2019re a PR person, I can\u2019t possibly think of a harder job right now than working at Boeing. It\u2019s not just clean-up on aisle six, it\u2019s clean up the entire store, loading dock and parking lot on a daily \u2014 if not hourly \u2014 basis. And boy did Boeing have to bring out a lot of mops on Thursday. But this time, it kinda, sorta just maybe wasn\u2019t Boeing\u2019s fault. Let me explain. Boeing held a press conference from a factory in Renton, Washington, on Tuesday to talk about quality improvements. But Boeing surely knew that they\u2019d get asked about the door plug that blew off a 737 Max on an Alaska Airlines flight in January. So Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president of quality at Boeing, didn\u2019t bother beating around the bush. Lund kicked off the briefing by sharing why the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place were never installed before the plane left the factory in October: paperwork. The workers who needed to reinstall the bolts never had the work order telling them the work needed to be done, my colleagues Gregory Wallace and Chris Isidore reported. \u201cThe fact that one employee could not fill out one piece of paperwork in this condition and could result in an accident was shocking to all of us,\u201d Lund said. The lack of paperwork was not new information. It was previously disclosed in testimony before the US Senate Commerce Committee by none other than the head of the National Transportation Safety Board, the government agency leading the investigation. But strangely enough, Boeing sharing that information itself got Boeing in trouble with the NTSB. The agency reprimanded Boeing Thursday, saying it had \u201cblatantly violated\u201d the agency\u2019s rules. The violation, per an NTSB statement, was sharing \u201cinvestigative information\u201d and giving \u201can analysis of factual information previously released.\u201d This would basically be like your friend making a public Instagram announcement saying she\u2019s pregnant, prompting you to post on your story saying something like, \u201cMy best friend is going to be a mom!\u201d And then the friend sends you an angry text demanding you take it down because it\u2019s private information and you aren\u2019t allowed to comment on it. \u201cAs a party to many NTSB investigations over the past decades, few entities know the rules better than Boeing,\u201d the NTSB said (yeah, government agencies throw shade too sometimes). But the NTSB is taking matters even further, saying it will no longer share any information generated by the NTSB during its investigation and that it would be referring Boeing\u2019s conduct to the Department of Justice, meaning there could be a potential criminal probe. The NTSB declined to provide any further comment to CNN. Clean up, clean up everybody everywhere When the NTSB\u2019s statement went out, Boeing\u2019s PR team went back into crisis clean-up mode. I admit it\u2019s hard to take anything they say at face value, and part of my job as a journalist is to be skeptical and question any claims PR people make. But I think there\u2019s an ounce (okay, maybe closer to a quarter ounce) of truth in Boeing\u2019s response to the NTSB. It said it held the briefing in an effort to \u201ctake responsibility\u201d and be transparent, adding that it \u201cshared context on the lessons we have learned from the January 5 accident.\u201d \u201cWe deeply regret that some of our comments, intended to make clear our responsibility in the accident and explain the actions we are taking, overstepped the NTSB\u2019s role as the source of investigative information,\u201d Boeing said Thursday. Without giving Boeing too much credit, at least some executives were trying to take a sliver of ownership. But apparently, that\u2019s an NTSB violation. At the same time, rules are rules no matter how hypocritical they are. Boeing probably should have treaded more carefully. When CNN reached out to Boeing, a spokesperson responded, \u201cWe defer to the NTSB for information regarding the investigation.\u201d The irony in all this is the NTSB\u2019s reaction is distracting from the more glaring story here: how a simple thing like a lack of paperwork may have endangered a plane full of people.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/business/boeing-ntsb-violation-absurdity/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_business_japan-yen-note-nepal-paperbush-intl-hnk", "text": "Banks across Japan began stocking their ATMs on Wednesday with shiny new yen notes sourced from an unlikely location \u2013 vibrant yellow flowering paperbush shrubs that grow on craggy Himalayan mountains in Nepal. Before entering the wallets of Japanese consumers, the yen notes had a long, complex journey involving months of labor and transport by land and air across thousands of kilometers. And this process has offered a potential new source of income to communities in one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, by providing cash for one of its richest. Though Japan has pushed for more digital payments in recent years, cash still reigns king, and it trails behind other Asian countries like China that have gone almost completely cashless. \u201cI really think that Nepal contributed to Japan\u2019s economy, as cash is fundamental to the Japanese economy,\u201d said Tadashi\u00a0Matsubara, president of Kanpou, the company that produces paper for the Japanese government. \u201cWithout Nepal, Japan would not function.\u201d The long journey The path from shrub to bill begins at the foot of the Himalayas in Nepal, near towns that have long been famous not for their agriculture but as gateways to Mount Everest. Here, every spring, hillsides erupt in yellow \u2013 the flowers of the mitsumata plant, also known as argeli or paperbush, native to the Himalayan range. Its bark has long, strong fibers that are perfect for making thin yet durable paper, according to the Kantou website. It used to be grown domestically in Japan, but production has been slowly dwindling for years, said Matsubara. It\u2019s hard work tied to the countryside, and people are increasingly moving from rural areas to big cities like Tokyo in search of jobs \u2013 leaving shrinking villages and dying industries. \u201cThe current reality is that the number of farmers who produce paperbush is becoming smaller and smaller,\u201d Matsubara said. The diminishing rural population, worsened by Japan\u2019s demographic crisis as birth rates plummet, also mean \u201cthere are no heirs, there are no inheritors\u201d to paperbush farms, he added. That\u2019s where the Nepali supply chain came in. Kanpou first went to Nepal through a charity program in the 1990s to help farmers dig wells \u2013 and once there, discovered paperbush growing on mountains as far as the eye could see. They began teaching farmers to cultivate the crop, initially only produced and exported in small quantities. But as the shortage of Japanese paperbush became evident in the following years,\u00a0Kanpou and the Nepali farmers ramped up production until they became the main source of the yen bill. It\u2019s a protracted process, said Matsubara: farmers plant seedlings in early summer, harvest their branches in the fall, then spend several months processing the bark through steaming, peeling, washing and drying. Once the raw paper is ready in the winter, it\u2019s sent to the Nepali capital Kathmandu and driven to the western Indian city Kolkata, where it\u2019s brought by ship to Yokohama, Japan. After inspection, the paper is further processed, printed, and cut into cash by the National Printing Bureau in nearby Odawara city. And the new bills being distributed this week boast a number of new features, according to the Bank of Japan \u2013 including hologram portraits depicting a number of prominent historical figures to prevent counterfeiting, with the portrait heads appearing to turn from side to side as you move the bill. While other countries have previously used holograms on currency, this is the first such use of hologram portraits, according to the central bank. Other features include parts of the bill printed in pearl and luminescent ink, and tactile marks for the visually impaired. Benefit to communities As the new bills begin circulating, demand for paperbush is rising, with Matsubara saying the new notes appear to use more raw material than the old ones. In 2022, paper articles and paper scraps \u2013 including other products besides the paperbush used for currency \u2013 made up more than 9% of Nepal\u2019s exports to Japan,\u00a0worth $1.2 million, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), which visualizes and distributes international trade data. As of last year, more than 60% of transactions in Japan were done with cash, with the remainder by digital payments and other methods, according to the national Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. The profits from the paperbush sales have provided a new revenue stream to Nepali communities, said Matsubara. He claimed the growing industry has helped build new facilities and infrastructure in Kanpou\u2019s partner villages, and provided newfound financial stability to vulnerable families. Since 2016, Kanpou has also received aid funding from the government\u2019s Japan International Cooperation Agency, allowing them to expand operations, Matsubara said. Kanpou does not have data on the average incomes for their partner villages, Matsubara said \u2013 but he estimated that each household earns less than 10,000 yen (about $62), given the lack of other dominant agricultural products at that altitude. In 2015, rural Nepali households had an average monthly income of 27,511 Nepalese rupees (about $205), according to global economic database CEIC. Meanwhile, the latest crop of paperbush from Nepal\u2019s Ilam district was sold to Japan for more than 180,000 yen (about $1,114) \u2013 meaning a revenue of about 30,000 yen ($185) for each of the six farmer groups that participated within the district, Matsubara said. CNN was unable to independently verify Matsubara\u2019s claims. \u201cInitially, this activity was about Japanese aid to Nepal. Now, I think it is different \u2026 the Nepalese people are working hard (to help) Japan,\u201d he said \u201cWithout mitsumata, Nepal\u2019s (paperbush), we would not have been able to produce the new bill.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/business/japan-yen-note-nepal-paperbush-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_28_economy_us-pce-inflation-fed-consumer-spending-may", "text": "Prices in the US didn\u2019t rise in May, lending a welcome reprieve to cost-wary Americans and helping to bring inflation even closer to normal levels. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index \u2014 a closely watched inflation gauge that the Federal Reserve uses for its 2% target \u2014 was unchanged from April and slowed to 2.6% for the 12 months ended in May from 2.7% the month before, according to Commerce Department data released Friday. It\u2019s the first time since November that prices didn\u2019t increase on a monthly basis. Cheaper prices at the pump certainly helped (energy prices were down 2.1% for the month) and falling goods prices (down 0.4%) helped to slow overall inflation, according to the report. Food prices increased just 0.1%. Even when taking volatile food and energy prices out of the equation, the downward trajectory was clear: The core PCE price index showed prices ticking up just 0.1% for the month, the slowest pace since November, and pulling the annual rate down to a fresh three-year low of 2.6% from 2.8%. \u201cInflationary pressures are easing overall, and I think the fear and the scare of the first quarter [when inflation heated back up] is now well behind us,\u201d Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CNN in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the right types of dynamics when it comes to inflation.\u201d The outlook is even rosier if you want to get \u201cnerdy\u201d with the data, Daco noted, adding that the unrounded indexes show increases of 2.56% for headline PCE and 2.57% for core, he said. Friday\u2019s report was in line with economists\u2019 expectations. Consumers are a \u2018little bit more prudent\u2019 The Commerce Department\u2019s monthly Personal Income and Outlays report also includes critical data on how Americans earn, spend and save. And what May\u2019s data showed was a more cautious and prudent \u2014 but far from stingy \u2014 consumer, Daco said. Consumer spending, which is a significant driver of economic activity, increased 0.2% for the month, accelerating from 0.1% the month before. Excluding inflation, real spending grew 0.3%. Spending was strong on goods, especially in the areas of recreational vehicles, as well as non-durables like clothing. Services spending increased at the slowest pace in 10 months, but consumers spent freely on transportation and recreation but pulled back a little at restaurants, Daco added. \u201cIt\u2019s still consumers spending, but [they\u2019re] being a little bit more judicious, a little bit more prudent with how much they spend and what they spend on,\u201d he said. A 0.5% increase in personal income as well as disposable income (which excludes taxes) helped boost spending levels. As such, people were able to put more money away: The personal savings rate ticked up to 3.9%, its highest level since January. Earlier this month, doubt was cast on the strength of that economic engine when retail sales data showed a lower-than-anticipated increase for May. While cheaper gas prices factored into the overall pullback, the modest gain raised some alarm bells that Americans were finally close to being tapped out. \u201cThe report couldn\u2019t have been much better for the economy at this stage, as consumers banked an income boost while inflation stayed flat from the previous month,\u201d Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a statement. \u201cMore income is key to improving spending, which has been lackluster recently, and weaker inflation gives the Fed more leeway to cut rates, especially if the job market flags.\u201d The Fed\u2019s next move Americans have been dealing with above-average \u2014 and, for a good stretch, decades-high \u2014 inflation for going on three years now. The strong and resilient job market helped households stay afloat, contributed to continued spending and kept a recession at bay; however, pervasive and prolonged inflation have sapped away precious dollars and worn down people\u2019s psyches in the process. And in an election year, those effects are top of mind for voters and factored heavily into Thursday night\u2019s first presidential debate. Consumer confidence readings have been depressed since inflation began its rapid ascent in early 2021. On Friday, the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index held mostly steady with May, dipping by a \u201cscant and statistically insignificant\u201d 0.9 index points to 68.2, its lowest reading of the year. Economists have said that slowing inflation combined with the ongoing softening in economic growth could likely ensure at least one Fed rate cut this year. Interest rates currently are at a 23-year high as a result of the central bank\u2019s aggressive campaign to tame inflation. \u201cThis is the lowest monthly core inflation increase that we\u2019ve seen this year and it furthers the narrative that the disinflationary trend that stalled during the first quarter is back to life again,\u201d Olu Sonola, Fitch Ratings\u2019 head of US economic research, said in commentary issued Friday. \u201cCore inflation is now below the year-end median estimate that was penciled in at the last [Fed meeting]. If the trend we saw this month continues consistently for another two months, the Fed may finally have the confidence necessary for a rate cut in September.\u201d The May PCE data boosted investors\u2019 optimism for a September rate cut. On Friday morning, the probability increased to 61.1% from Thursday\u2019s 59.5% for the federal funds rate moving a quarter-point lower, according to the CME FedWatch tool.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/economy/us-pce-inflation-fed-consumer-spending-may/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices", "text": "Actress Judy Garland never recorded her voice to read an audiobook of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but you\u2019ll soon be able to hear her rendition of the children\u2019s novel that inspired the movie nonetheless. Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}

Job openings jumped higher to 8.14 million in May, from a downwardly revised 7.91 million in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report released Tuesday. Economists had expected openings would fall to 7.91 million, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Despite the uptick in job postings, which can be quite volatile, May\u2019s JOLTS report marked a significant milestone for the US labor market: The ratio of job openings to those who are unemployed fell to 1.22 available jobs per job seeker, matching the figure seen in February 2020, a month prior to the pandemic lockdowns that shocked the global economy. That ratio has been steadily moving lower since hitting a record 2.0 in March 2022, JOLTS data shows. \u201cThe report was another sign that the labor market is holding firm,\u201d Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a statement issued Tuesday. \u201cSo far there are no indications that job growth will flag this year, so consumer spending power will continue to increase and the expansion looks solid.\u201d Industries seeing the biggest increase in openings included manufacturing (specifically durable goods) and government (federal, state and local). Those seeing the greatest pullback from April included real estate and leisure and hospitality, BLS data shows. Pendulum swings away from workers Other seasonally adjusted measures of labor turnover showed continued stability in the US jobs market, which has gradually cooled in recent months while remaining historically strong. The estimated number of hires moved up to 5.76 million from 5.62 million in April; layoffs and separations bounced higher to 1.65 million in May, up from 1.54 million; while the number of voluntary quits inched upward to 3.46 million from 3.45 million. While both hires and job openings rates (as a percentage of total employment) ticked higher for May, the quits rate and layoffs rate were unchanged. Economists have been closely watching the quits rate \u2014 which has held steady at 2.2% for seven months running \u2014 as it serves as a signal for workers\u2019 willingness to test the labor market\u2019s waters. When people switch jobs, that typically can correlate to bigger pay bumps, which in turn potentially could make it more difficult to rein in inflation. Job-switchers\u2019 pay raises have pared down significantly from the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d period, according to a newly released analysis from Bank of America. Economists there analyzed internal customer data and found that median wage hikes are about half the size they were during the height of pandemic-era job changes. In fact, the median pay raises are just below 2019 levels, David Tinsley, senior economist at the Bank of America Institute, told CNN. \u201cPeople are still moving between jobs at a slightly faster rate than they were pre-pandemic \u2026 but the pay raises they\u2019re getting when they make those moves is a degree softer,\u201d he said. \u201cThat sort of suggests that the pendulum has swung slightly more in favor of firms and away from workers.\u201d Labor market steady or a turning point? The labor market appears to be at a crossroads, Nick Bunker, Indeed Hiring Lab\u2019s head of economic research, wrote in commentary posted Tuesday. \u201cThe words \u2018little changed\u2019 were repeated no fewer than a half dozen times in the May JOLTS release, and virtually every key indicator tracked showed limited notable movement, either up or down,\u201d Bunker wrote. \u201cThis short-run stability is a good thing. But the question remains if this period of calm can continue or if more unsteady times are on the horizon.\u201d \u201cThis current level of job openings is consistent with a healthy, sustainable and balanced market, but any continued declines below these current levels will quickly become more worrisome,\u201d he wrote. It may take an interest rate cut to ensure employers\u2019 demand for workers doesn\u2019t tumble too far, he added. Federal Reserve officials still broadly believe the job market remains on solid footing, which is allowing central banker to comfortably keep interest rates perched at a 23-year high as they await more evidence that inflation is under control. But some Fed officials have noted that the job market has lost momentum recently and that it\u2019s highly unclear whether it will continue to hold steady or weaken further. \u201cIf employment starts falling apart or if the\u00a0economy\u00a0begins to weaken, which you\u2019ve seen some warning signs, you\u2019ve got to balance that off with the progress you\u2019re making on the price front,\u201d Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday during a conference hosted by the European Central Bank in Sintra, Portugal. \u201cThe unemployment rate is still quite low, but it has been rising,\u201d he said. More jobs data coming Friday In May, the US unemployment rate increased to 4%, a rate that hadn\u2019t been seen since January 2022. Still, job growth remained strong in May, coming in at an estimated net gain of 272,000. Economists largely expect that job gains cooled off in June. As of Tuesday, FactSet consensus estimates are for a 189,000 net gain.  First-time claims for unemployment benefits (considered a proxy for layoffs) have drifted higher in recent weeks, landing in line with pre-pandemic averages. \u201cThey\u2019re still low, historically speaking, but they are up between the May and June payroll survey reference months, so we do think we could see some slowdown in job growth over the month,\u201d Marisa DiNatale, head labor economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics, told CNN in an interview. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the latest jobs report at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/economy/us-jolts-job-openings-layoffs-may/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_success_how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges", "text": "Long before you take your high schooler on college campus tours, consider this: Shopping for college shouldn\u2019t be any different than shopping for a home.\u00a0When you want to buy a home, you come up with a range of how much you can afford and get pre-qualified for a mortgage. Then you look in neighborhoods that offer homes that meet your family\u2019s needs and fall within your price range. \u201cAdopt a mindset that we\u2019re buying college like we\u2019re buying a house,\u201d said Beth Walker, author of \u201cBuying College Better\u201d and \u201cNever Pay Retail for College.\u201d As a financial adviser and certified\u00a0college planning specialist, Walker tries to help families avoid a situation that many find themselves in at the 11th hour: Their child applies \u2014 and gets into \u2014 schools they cannot afford because the schools won\u2019t give them enough aid. And then they just \u2026 try to make it work, no matter how much debt is involved for the parents or the student. Instead, she advises families to start as early as 9th or 10th grade in figuring out what is affordable for them as a family \u2014 so parents don\u2019t sacrifice their own financial welfare and the future college student doesn\u2019t drown in debt upon graduation. And second, she recommends assessing how a child\u2019s talents and interests pare with majors and careers they might want to pursue. Doing both those things can help you target the right colleges to apply to. Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners, defines the perfect college as one \u201cwhere a student can go be happy, safe and successful, graduate in four years or less with a marketable degree and little or no debt.\u201d In helping families align parents\u2019 affordability constraints with their student\u2019s academic and social needs, he cautions them not to automatically assume the Ivys or other high-prestige schools will be best simply because of their status. And he stresses what success in life looks like after college and notes that an Ivy League degree isn\u2019t the only path to achieving it, especially if your child won\u2019t get much aid to attend. In fact, said Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, a lot of brand-name schools don\u2019t even offer merit-based aid, only need-based. So if you\u2019re not rich, but you make too much to qualify for need-based aid, you could find yourself having to cover the entire cost of tuition, room and board every year, which is pushing $90,000 at some US colleges. Set up financial guardrails well before the college search Fothergill created a free calculator called CostHero that lets parents assess what financial resources they will have available to pay for a child\u2019s college education. It then provides a range of affordability: At the low end is the number representing what they can pay if they don\u2019t take on debt. And at the high end is the number they can pay if they also take out an unsubsidized federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). \u201cIf you\u2019re not in a position to write a check for $90,000 a year, put up guardrails for yourself so you don\u2019t blow up your retirement,\u201d he said. The calculator inputs let you set the amount of resources you\u2019re willing to use to pay for college from your income and savings, your child\u2019s earnings from summer jobs, any family gifts, and any federal Stafford loans your child may take. It also factors in if you qualify for the federal American Opportunity Tax Credit. That credit, for qualified educational expenses, will reduce your tax bill or increase any refund you have coming. The calculator also gives you a debt-to-income score like the kind a mortgage lender might use to assess whether you\u2019re a good credit risk. Ideally, he said, you don\u2019t want your housing costs to exceed 36% of your gross income and your total debt \u2014 including debt from housing, cars, credit cards and any parental education loans \u2014 to exceed 43%. If your DTI ratio is close to or higher than 43% that is a sign you could get yourself into trouble if you end up having any financial problems while your child is in college, Fothergill said. \u201cIf folks have a way to determine the range of affordability prior to the onset of the college search, the outcomes are a lot better.\u00a0 For example, if one knows that the range of affordability is between $30,000 [a year] with no parent debt and $50,000 with parent debt, then any college that comes in with a net cost in that range is, by definition, affordable,\u201d Fothergill said. Net cost refers to the true cost of attendance after figuring out how much aid your child may get (e.g., grants and scholarships). Figure out where your student may qualify for the most aid Generally speaking, the biggest tuition discounts go to the most academically accomplished students in an incoming class. \u201cThe student needs to be in the top 25% of those admitted,\u201d Walker said. Getting into that top 25% cohort is based on SAT or ACT scores, and having a high, unweighted GPA based on a rigorous high school curriculum. The curriculum\u2019s academic rigor can be further bolstered by taking AP courses. Since your child is more likely to make the top quartile at some schools than others, Fothergill and Walker both recommend your child focus on applying only to those schools in which they stand the best chances of being in that top group to maximize their chances for merit-based aid. Otherwise, you\u2018ll spend money to apply to guidance-counselor-recommended \u201csafety\u201d schools or \u201creach\u201d schools with no sense if those places are affordable to you should your child get in. Using reported data from admissions officers about their key criteria in admitting an incoming class and based on what more than 1,000 schools report about the qualifications they used to grant aid, Fothergill created another tool called ListHero. It gives students a score that helps gauge\u00a0how competitive their profile is\u00a0at a given school, relative to others admitted, and by extension their eligibility for tuition discounts. Right now the tool is only available to college planning professionals for a fee. But Fothergill plans to create a free mini-version for consumers to use. For parents doing their own research on test scores, GPA requirements, costs and aid, he recommends checking the Department of Education College Scorecard, the site CollegeData.com and the College Board. Other ways to reduce college costs before applying While your children are in high school they can take other steps to reduce the total cost of their education. One way is by doing well on the PSAT to qualify to compete for a National Merit Scholarship. Another is to take AP courses. If their high school doesn\u2019t offer them, there is a program called Freshman Year for Free offered by the Modern States Education Alliance. It provides free AP placement courses and pays the fee for students to take the AP tests or college-level preparation (CLEP) tests administered through the College Board. Getting the minimum AP scores a college requires to earn a college credit will lower how much you ultimately have to spend on tuition. A third option is to see if your state has a program that offers a year of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to a state university from which your child could earn their degree. Or, if you plan to go to any other college, make sure the school will accept the credits from a community college course you plan to take. No matter what steps you take, starting the research and budgeting process early can save everyone a lot of stress, debt and potential heartache in the end. Said Walker: \u201cWe have to be a lot more intentional about this purchase.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/success/how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}

He struggled to explain what he would accomplish in a second term. He struggled to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s provocations. He struggled to hold Mr. Trump accountable for his lies, his failures and his chilling plans. More than once, he struggled to make it to the end of a sentence,\u201d the board wrote in an opinion piece published Friday. \u201cThe greatest public service Mr. Biden can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election. As it stands, the president is engaged in a reckless gamble. There are Democratic leaders better equipped to present clear, compelling and energetic alternatives to a second Trump presidency. There is no reason for the party to risk the stability and security of the country by forcing voters to choose between Mr. Trump\u2019s deficiencies and those of Mr. Biden. It\u2019s too big a bet to simply hope Americans will overlook or discount Mr. Biden\u2019s age and infirmity that they see with their own eyes,\u201d the Times also said. The board went on to say it would still support Biden as its \u201cunequivocal pick\u201d if the choice remains between him and former President Donald Trump. The Biden campaign hit back at the editorial board\u2019s critique on Friday evening. \u201cThe last time Joe Biden lost the New York Times editorial board\u2019s endorsement, it turned out pretty well for him,\u201d Biden campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond told CNN. The Times\u00a0endorsed\u00a0two Democratic presidential candidates in 2020: Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren. Biden campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins Friday night that he has \u201c100% confidence in Joe Biden,\u201d adding that it will be \u201chis decision alone whether he\u2019s going to continue.\u201d \u201cAnd I think he answered that question for the public today in North Carolina,\u201d Landrieu said on \u201cThe Source.\u201d The New York Times is the latest to critique Biden\u2019s\u00a0debate\u00a0performance, which has set off alarm bells among top Democrats \u2014 leaving some to openly question whether Biden can stay atop of the Democratic ticket. \u201cHe seemed a little disoriented. He did get stronger as the debate went on. But by that time, I think the panic had set in,\u201d longtime Democratic operative and CNN senior political commentator David Axelrod said. Axelrod also gave voice to a conversation happening among many Democrats on Thursday night: \u201cThere are going to be discussions about whether he should continue.\u201d On MSNBC, the cable news channel\u00a0that\u2019s seen as the\u00a0home to the country\u2019s progressive political wing, anchor Alex Wagner said Thursday immediately following the debate that there had \u201cbeen a uniformly negative reaction to Biden\u2019s performance tonight.\u201d \u201cThis was about revealing who Donald Trump was, but it was also Joe Biden battling a caricature of himself as an enfeebled person,\u201d Wagner said of the debate. \u201cAnd he did nothing to disabuse, I think, the country of the notion that he is very old and was lost frequently in that debate.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_06_28_business_uber-lyft-minimum-wage-massachusetts", "text": "Uber\u00a0Technologies\u00a0and Lyft\u00a0on Thursday agreed to adopt a $32.50 hourly minimum pay standard for Massachusetts drivers and pay $175 million to settle a lawsuit by the state\u2019s attorney general alleging they improperly treated drivers as independent contractors who can legally receive lower compensation than employees. The companies also agreed to give drivers paid sick leave, accident insurance, and healthcare stipends and to stop funding or supporting a ballot initiative that would have asked voters in November to cement app-based drivers\u2019 status as contractors, Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell said. Uber\u00a0and Lyft in separate statements said the agreement reflected the desire of most drivers to work on their own terms while receiving many of the key benefits that are legally guaranteed to employees. \u201cIn taking this opportunity, we\u2019ve resolved historical liabilities by constructing a new operating model that balances both flexibility and benefits,\u201d said Tony West,\u00a0Uber\u2019s chief legal officer. The agreement requires\u00a0Uber\u00a0to pay $148 million and Lyft to pay $27 million to the state. At least $140 million will be paid out to drivers, according to a court filing. Campbell, a Democrat, made the announcement hours after Massachusetts\u2019 top court\u00a0cleared the way\u00a0for voters to decide whether to approve the industry-backed ballot measure, along with a\u00a0dueling labor-backed proposal\u00a0to allow drivers to unionize that will continue to move forward. It was also the eve of closing arguments in a\u00a0non-jury trial\u00a0in a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0filed in 2020 by Campbell\u2019s predecessor, now-Governor Maura Healey, over the status of drivers whose services have helped fuel the U.S. gig worker economy. Campbell had been asking a judge to conclude that the state\u2019s 55,000\u00a0Uber\u00a0drivers and 35,000 Lyft drivers are employees under state law and therefore entitled to benefits such as a minimum wage, overtime and earned sick time. Studies have shown that using contractors can cost companies as much as 30% less than employees. \u201cFor years, these companies have underpaid their drivers and denied them basic benefits,\u201d Cambpell said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s agreement holds\u00a0Uber\u00a0and Lyft accountable.\u201d The settlement provides for greater benefits and pay for\u00a0Uber\u00a0and Lyft drivers than provided under a similar settlement\u00a0in November with New York state\u00a0and under legislation signed into law in May in Minnesota. Uber\u00a0and Lyft in defending themselves at trial had argued that Campbell\u2019s office misunderstood their business models and that they could be forced to cut or end service in Massachusetts if their drivers were deemed employees. They along with DoorDash\u00a0and Instacart had financially supported Flexibility and Benefits for Massachusetts Drivers, the ballot measure committee behind the proposal to ask voters to deem app-based drivers as contractors. The proposal had also called for providing drivers benefits similar to those in the settlement. After its announcement, Conor Yunits, a spokesperson for the industry-backed campaign, said the group will no longer be moving forward with the initiative. The industry through a $200 million campaign\u00a0had previously in\u00a02020 convinced California voters to pass a measure similar to the one backed by the companies in Massachusetts, solidifying drivers as independent contractors with some benefits.\u00a0Litigation challenging\u00a0that measure is ongoing.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/business/uber-lyft-minimum-wage-massachusetts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_business_airline-woes-despite-record-passenger-traffic", "text": "A record number of passengers are expected to pass through US airports this holiday travel week. You\u2019d think this would be a great time to run an airline. You\u2019d be wrong. Airlines face numerous problems, including higher costs, such as fuel, wages and interest rates. And problems at Boeing mean airlines have too few planes to expand routes to support a record numbers of flyers. Strong bookings can\u2019t entirely offset that financial squeeze. The good news for passengers is they will be spared most of the problems hurting airlines\u2019 bottom lines \u2014 at least in the near term. Airfares are driven far more by supply and demand, not their costs. But in the long run, the airlines\u2019 difficulties could mean fewer airline routes, less passenger choice and ultimately a less pleasant flying experience. Profit squeeze Industry analysts expect airlines to report a drop of about $2 billion in profit, or 33%, when they report financial results for the April to June period this year. That would follow losses of nearly $800 million across the industry in the first quarter. Labor costs and jet fuel prices, the airlines\u2019 two largest costs, are both sharply higher this year. Airline pilot unions just landed double-digit pay hikes to make up for years of stagnant wages; flight attendant unions now want comparable raises. Jet fuel prices are climbing because of higher demand in the summer. According to the International Air Transport Association\u2019s jet fuel monitor, prices are up 1.4% in just the last week, and about 4% in the last month.   Adding to the airlines\u2019 problems is the crisis at Boeing, as well as the less-well-publicized problems with some of the jet engines on planes from rival Airbus. Since an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max jet lost a door plug on a January 5 flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane 10 minutes after takeoff, the Federal Aviation Administration has limited how many jets Boeing can make over concerns about quality and safety. As a result, airlines have dramatically reduced plans to expand their fleets and replace older planes with more fuel efficient models. In some cases, airlines have asked pilots to take time off without pay, and carriers such as Southwest and United have announced pilot hiring freezes. In addition to the problems at Boeing, hundreds of the Airbus A220 and A320 family of jets globally have also been grounded for at least a month or more to deal with engine problems. Just about all the planes with those engines have been out of sevice for at least a few days to undergo examinations.

{"id": "2024_07_02_business_state-farm-california-rate-hikes", "text": "State Farm is seeking increases of as much as 52% for some of its residential insurance rates in California, which could ramp up the financial burden for many homeowners and renters in the state\u2019s troubled insurance market. It\u2019s the third major change for State Farm in California within the last year. The insurer stopped selling insurance for new homes in the state last summer, citing wildfire risks and skyrocketing construction costs. The insurer, California\u2019s largest, is requesting a 30% rate increase for its homeowners line, a 52% rate increase for renters and a 36% rate increase for condominium owners. State Farm was previously approved for a 20% hike for homeowners\u2019 and condominium owners\u2019 policies last December. The company said in a statement that its state subsidiary, State Farm General, is \u201cworking toward its long-term sustainability in California\u201d and that the rate increases are \u201cdriven by increased costs and risk and are necessary for State Farm General to deliver on the promises the company makes every day to its customers.\u201d \u201cWe continue to look for ways to maintain competitive rates and help our customers manage their risk,\u201d a State Farm spokesperson said. \u201cCustomers with questions are encouraged to speak with their local State Farm agent. The agent can review the customer\u2019s policy, including deductibles and coverages.\u201d The California Department of Insurance has to approve the rate changes. \u201cState Farm General\u2019s latest rate filings raise serious questions about its financial condition,\u201d California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in a statement. \u201cThis has the potential to affect millions of California consumers and the integrity of our residential property insurance market.\u201d Lara said his agency \u201cwill investigate State Farm\u2019s financial situation, including a rate hearing on these applications if necessary.\u201d He added that \u201cnothing changes today for State Farm policyholders as a result of these filings. We are going to lead with facts to make sure Californians are protected.\u201d The company made its previous decision to hike rates \u201cdue to historic increases in construction costs outpacing inflation, rapidly growing catastrophe exposure, and a challenging reinsurance market,\u201d according to a May 2023 statement from State Farm General. (The changes didn\u2019t affect its existing auto insurance coverage.) California has seen an average of\u00a0more than 7,000 wildfires each year, consuming an average of over 2 million acres, over the past several years, according to data from the governor\u2019s office. Scientists and California authorities blame the climate crisis for the intensity of the fire seasons. A few months following State Farm\u2019s decision to stop offering new home insurance, Farmers Insurance also started limiting new homeowners insurance policies in California, citing high costs and wildfire risks. Farmers is the second-largest provider of homeowners insurance in the state, after State Farm. It\u2019s getting\u00a0harder and harder to find homeowners insurance\u00a0in the states that are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. In Florida, Farmer\u2019s also recently stopped offering its home, auto and umbrella policies in the hurricane-prone state. \u2013CNN\u2019s Cheri Mossburg contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/business/state-farm-california-rate-hikes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_success_saving-under-high-interest-rates", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is an updated version of an article that originally ran on May 1. As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged for its seventh meeting in a row on Wednesday. People carrying variable-rate debt like credit cards and those seeking a loan won\u2019t be happy given that the Fed\u2019s rate, which directly and indirectly affects consumers\u2019 borrowing costs, remains at a 23-year high. Those rates will likely stay high for a while. At this point, only one cut is seen as likely before the end of the year, according to US central bankers\u2019 latest summary of economic projections. But whenever the cuts start, they may be small. \u201cAbsent a complete about-face from the economy, interest rates aren\u2019t likely to come down soon enough, or fast enough, to provide meaningful relief to borrowers. Utilize zero-percent credit card balance transfer offers, shop around for lower fixed-rate personal loans and home equity loans, and channel as much income as possible toward paying down this debt as quickly as possible,\u201d said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com\u2019s chief financial analyst. But the Fed\u2019s decision leaves savers, once again, in the catbird seat when it comes to making money on their money. \u201cSavers are enjoying the best returns on savings accounts and CDs in more than 15 years, with the most competitive offers outpacing inflation. In addition, these conditions are poised to persist for the foreseeable future,\u201d McBride said. Online high-yield savings accounts The best bang for your savings can still be had in online high-yield savings accounts at FDIC-insured banks, which yield way more than today\u2019s 0.58% overall average savings rate. As of June 11, the average online savings account rate was 4.40%, according to DepositAccounts.com. And many online high-yield accounts continue to offer rates of 5% or more. Say you have $10,000 in savings. If you leave it parked in a regular savings account at 0.5%, you\u2019ll get $50 in interest for a year. If you put it instead in a 5% high-yield account, you\u2019ll get $500. A high-yield savings account is the best place to park money you\u2019ll need to cover emergencies as well as anticipated large expenses that you have to pay in the next three months to a year. As with any savings account, banks can lower the rate they offer \u2014 also known as the APY \u2014 at any time. And you can be sure they will do just that when the Fed looks like it will finally start cutting rates, McBride said. But, he added, since rates are likely to be cut in small increments, online high-yield savings accounts may continue to offer inflation-beating returns for some time. \u201cThey will still offer the best way to preserve your [money\u2019s] buying power,\u201d McBride said. Money market accounts and money market funds Money market deposit accounts and money market mutual funds are generating yields competitive with the best high-yield savings accounts. But there are important differences. Money market deposit accounts are bank products. So, assuming your bank is FDIC insured, your account is too. (Or, if your account is at a federally backed credit union, your money will be\u00a0insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.) As with high-yield accounts, you may get the best deals at an online bank. But money market accounts may have a higher minimum deposit requirement than a high-yield account. Money market funds, by contrast, are an investment product \u2014 they generate return by investing in short-term, low-risk debt instruments and are currently yielding an average of 5.12%, according to the Crane 100 Money Fund Index. Such funds are a good place to park cash you have in your brokerage account that you may want to use at some point to buy equities or bonds, McBride said. Money market funds are not FDIC-insured, but any brokerage you use should be insured by the\u00a0Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which\u00a0covers your funds up to a limit if your brokerage ever goes under. Certificates of deposit CDs are still a great place to park any money you can leave untouched for a fixed\u00a0period of time \u2014 anywhere from a few months to five years or longer. As of June 11, the average rate was 4.971% on an online one-year CD, and 3.815% on a five-year CD, according to DepositAccounts.com. While your brick-and-mortar bank may offer a CD at a good rate, you may get a better one shopping around. The easiest way to do that without having to set up an additional account at another bank is to shop for CDs through your online brokerage, which is likely to offer a wide array of CDs from many different banks. At Schwab.com, for instance, CDs on offer ranging in duration from three months all the way up to 10 years offered average annual returns over 5%, with most ranging between 5.30% and 5.45%. The highest annual average was 5.56% for a three-month CD. If you have to withdraw money before the end of a CD\u2019s term, you can always get all of your principal back but may forfeit some of the interest earned as an early withdrawal penalty. Treasury bills and notes Beyond deposit accounts, investing in short-term Treasury bills and intermediate-term Treasury notes has been another way to earn a competitive return with virtually no risk since Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Treasury bills come in six different maturities: 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 13 weeks, 17 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks. Treasury notes mature in two, three, five, seven or 10 years. \u201cAs long as the Fed holds its rate in the 5.25% to 5.5% range, we expect most Treasury bill yields to hover around 5.25% as well,\u201d said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. But, Martin added, \u201cWhile the timing of rate cuts has been pushed back, we still expect them to arrive later this year, and investors in short-term investments would likely face reinvestment risk.\u201d That\u2019s why he suggests investors consider buying some intermediate-term investments now before rates are cut if they want to lock in a higher yield for some of their money, such as Treasury notes maturing in the next four to 10 years. On Wednesday, yields on Treasury bills were north of 5% and yields on Treasury notes were north of 4%, according to Schwab.com. When deciding whether it makes sense to invest in a CD or a Treasury for the same duration, you might opt for the Treasury if you live in a high-tax state, McBride suggested, since interest on Treasuries is\u00a0exempt from state and local taxes. In all instances, the easiest way to purchase Treasuries and other bonds is to do so through your brokerage account.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/success/saving-under-high-interest-rates/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}

The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said that while US District Judge Lewis Liman \u201calmost certainly unknowingly\u201d had a\u00a0conflict\u00a0of interest, his partiality could reasonably be questioned because his wife\u2019s ownership of Bank of America\u00a0stock created an \u201cappearance of impropriety.\u201d A spokesman for the Manhattan federal court, where Liman works, declined to comment. Tuesday\u2019s unsigned decision came nearly three years after a Wall Street Journal investigation found that more than 130 federal judges had since 2010 violated federal law and judicial ethics by overseeing cases involving companies in which they or family members owned stock. Bond investors accused Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, NatWest\u00a0and Wells Fargo\u00a0of overcharging them on\u00a0\u201codd-lot\u201d trades, which are worth less than $1 million and comprise most corporate bond trades. Liman, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, was assigned the\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0in April 2020 and dismissed it with prejudice in October 2021, three months after his wife sold $15,000 of Bank of America stock. In February 2022, a court clerk alerted parties to the\u00a0conflict, writing of the judge that the \u201cownership of stock neither affected nor impacted his decisions.\u201d It wasn\u2019t clear when Liman learned of the\u00a0conflict, and the case was reassigned to US District Judge Valerie Caproni, while investors appealed the dismissal. The\u00a0banks\u00a0said Liman\u2019s failure to uncover his\u00a0conflict\u00a0didn\u2019t require recusal or reviving the case. But the appeals court found a \u201clegitimate risk\u201d that similar violations could undermine public confidence in the judicial process. US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts highlighted in his 2021\u00a0annual report on the judiciary\u00a0a need for judges to be vigilant about\u00a0financial\u00a0conflicts. George Zelcs, a lawyer for the investors, said: \u201cWe look forward to litigating the case on the merits before Judge Caproni.\u201d Bank of America and lawyers who handled the\u00a0banks\u2019 appeal did not immediately respond to requests for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/business/us-judge-financial-conflict-revived-lawsuit-big-banks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}

A stalemate in Washington could destroy a landmark tax deal that was painstakingly hammered out among 140 countries over the better part of a decade. Some analysts say that the United States\u2019 inability to ratify the deal could lead to a tax war among the richest nations that would hit tech behemoths like Google, Apple, Meta and Amazon particularly hard. What\u2019s happening: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) worked for years to negotiate a deal among its member countries that would close loopholes allowing large multinational companies to avoid paying up to $240 billion each year in tax. In 2021, the OECD came up with an agreement that all parties signed on to. Called the \u201dPillar 1\u201d reform, it would simply require companies to pay taxes in the country they made money in, regardless of whether or not the company was headquartered there. It took more than a decade of work by the OECD and related parties to get there. The problem: The Pillar 1 reform was supposed to be ratified by June 30. That didn\u2019t happen. While the Biden administration broadly supports the plan, Senate Republicans are against it, and a divided Senate has stopped the US ratifying the agreement. (\u201cUnder the US Constitution, tax treaties require the advice and consent of the Senate, with a two-thirds majority vote of approval,\u201d according to the Senate Committee on Finance website.) Former President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has indicated that he wouldn\u2019t support the reforms if he\u2019s elected back into the Oval Office this November. Other countries aren\u2019t waiting to find out. Canada recently implemented a local tax on the world\u2019s largest tech companies, something the OECD treaty had sought to avoid. New Zealand has also said it will implement its own digital services tax on large multinational companies beginning in 2025. Manal Corwin, director of the OECD\u2019s Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, says that negotiations are still ongoing. \u201cCountries are still at the table, precisely because we are making progress,\u201d she wrote in a statement Monday. \u201cAs each of these milestones arrives, whether we successfully conclude by a given date or not, we get closer to the finish line,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is exactly why the commitment remains high and why we remain optimistic that the (group) can deliver a final agreement.\u201d What it means: If no global agreement goes into effect, some countries will begin to compete for revenue from large multinationals by lowering taxes in what is sometimes called a \u201ctax war.\u201d It will also mean that large tech companies will have to contend with inconsistent tax codes around the globe, as national taxes proliferate (see Canada and New Zealand.) \u201cWhen companies are feeling secure and can predict where policy is going and what the global financial outlook will be for the foreseeable future, they are much more confident in making investments,\u201d said Megan Funkhouser of the Information Technology Industry Council, a group that represents the tech sector. If taxation and global policy toward digital companies is \u201cuncertain, unpredictable and unstable\u201d she said, companies might not want to \u201cmake investments, contribute to economic growth and create and retain jobs.\u201d America\u2019s red-hot job market just won\u2019t quit The number of available jobs in the US unexpectedly grew in May, signaling\u00a0continued resilience\u00a0in the nation\u2019s labor market, reports my CNN colleague Alicia Wallace. Job openings jumped higher to 8.14 million in May, from a\u00a0downwardly revised 7.91 million in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report released Tuesday. Economists had expected openings would fall to 7.91 million, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Despite the uptick in job postings, which can be\u00a0quite volatile,\u00a0May\u2019s JOLTS report marked\u00a0a significant milestone for the US labor market: The ratio of job openings to those who are unemployed fell to 1.22 matching the figure seen in February 2020, a month prior to the pandemic lockdowns that shocked the global economy. That ratio has been steadily moving lower since hitting a record 2.0\u00a0in March 2022, JOLTS data shows. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the latest jobs report at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday. FTC unanimously moves to block $4 billion merger of mattress giants The Federal Trade Commission is taking a firm stance on a mattress merger. The agency unanimously voted to block mattress maker Tempur Sealy\u2019s purchase of Mattress Firm on Tuesday, reports my CNN colleague Ramishah Maruf. In May 2023, Tempur Sealy \u2014 the world\u2019s largest mattress supplier and manufacturer \u2014 agreed to buy the United States\u2019 largest bedding retailer\u00a0in a roughly $4 billion deal. The FTC\u00a0authorized a lawsuit in federal court\u00a0to block the acquisition. The Commission said that the proposed deal would suppress competition and raise prices for mattress buyers and give the companies \u201cenormous power\u201d in the mattress supply chain. The FTC also said that documents showed that competing mattress suppliers would lose access to its most important retail channel. These suppliers employ thousands of American workers, it said. The deal would have given the combined company 3,000 stores and 71 manufacturing facilities and was expected to close in the second half of 2024.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}

The American Farm Bureau found the price of two pounds of ground beef will cost an average of $12.77 this year, up 11% from a year ago. Pork is also more expensive, increasing 8% to an average of $15.49. Some cookout items are cheaper The good news is that some items are cheaper than last summer. For instance, two pounds of chicken breasts now cost an average of $7.83 nationally, down 4% from a year ago. Likewise, the cost of homemade potato salad dipped 4%. The price of other staples including cheese (+1%) and strawberries (+1%) barely budged. Zooming out, it\u2019s clear that food prices are no longer skyrocketing like they were two years ago. As inflation skyrocketed across the economy in 2022, the American Farm Bureau estimated a 17% year-over-year spike in the cost of a Fourth of July cookout. In that survey, the cost of ground beef had surged 36% over the year. And the cost of chicken breast climbed 33% amid outbreaks of bird flu, which also sent egg prices skyrocketing. After that sticker shock, Fourth of July grillers got a break on the bill last summer. The cost of a 10-person cookout dipped 3% to $67.73. The American Farm Bureau notes that, on an inflation-adjusted basis, this summer\u2019s BBQ bill is 5% lower than the record set in 2022. \ufeffGovernment data shows food inflation has eased substantially. Grocery prices increased just 1% in May from the year earlier, compared with a peak of nearly 6% in June 2023, according to the\u00a0Bureau of Labor Statistics. Of course, grocery prices differ significantly across the country. The cheapest Fourth of July barbecue bill is in the Northeast at $63.54, according to the American Farm Bureau. Consumers will spend a bit more in the South and the Midwest, at $68.33 and $68.26, respectively. The most expensive barbecue bills are in the West, where Americans will spend $80.88, or more than $1 higher per person than the national average.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/food/fourth-of-july-bbq-inflation-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}

In the lawsuit, filed Sunday in New York state court, the president\u2019s sonaccuses Fox News of unjust enrichment, intentionally inflicting emotional distress, and violating New York civil rights laws. The lawsuit makes good on\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s threat he made in April that he would take the network to court if it didn\u2019t immediately issue retractions and corrections. The miniseries, \u201cThe Trial of Hunter Biden,\u201d was a six-part offering on the Fox Nation digital streaming network, and was also promoted on Fox News, the cable TV channel. It featured a dramatized \u201cmock trial\u201d about Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas financial dealings that led in part to his federal tax indictment and that also fueled House Republicans\u2019 struggling impeachment inquiry into his father. Fox News\u00a0took down the miniseries\u00a0in late April, one day after Hunter Biden threatened to file a lawsuit. But according to the lawsuit, promotional materials for the miniseries are still on some Fox News-linked social media pages, and the miniseries episodes are still circulating \u201conline and in the public domain.\u201d A Fox News spokesperson claimed the lawsuit was meritless and \u201centirely politically motivated,\u201d and said the network looks forward to \u201cvindicating our rights in court.\u201d \u201cThe core complaint stems from a 2022 streaming program that Mr. Biden did not complain about until sending a letter in late April 2024,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe program was removed within days of the letter, in an abundance of caution, but Hunter Biden is a public figure who has been the subject of multiple investigations and is now a convicted felon. Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden\u2019s own making.\u201d The new lawsuit claims Fox News \u201ctargeted Mr. (Hunter) Biden in an effort to harass, annoy, alarm, and humiliate him, and tarnish his reputation.\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s son is seeking an unspecified amount of punitive damages, as well as any profits that Fox reaped from the miniseries, and other corrective measures. \u201cThe miniseries is fictionalized; it is not a news event. It was made for the purpose of trade and advertising, and merely exploits Mr. Biden\u2019s name, image, and likeness for Fox\u2019s commercial benefit,\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers wrote in the lawsuit. Hunter Biden\u2019s team said in the lawsuit that without his consent, Fox News \u201cunlawfully published numerous intimate images (both still and video) of Mr. Biden depicting him in the nude, depicting an unclothed or exposed intimate part of him, as well as engaged in sex acts.\u201d The right-wing network said these images originated form Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0infamous laptop\u00a0\u2013 data from which was leaked by allies for former President Donald Trump in 2020. The president\u2019s son was\u00a0convicted at a trial\u00a0last month on federal gun charges, and faces a second trial this fall on alleged tax crimes. However, he hasn\u2019t been charged in connection with the bribery and foreign lobbying allegations that were at the center of Fox\u2019s \u201cmock trial\u201d series.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/media/hunter-biden-sues-fox-news/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_01_success_buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage", "text": "Moving somewhere new when you retire isn\u2019t uncommon. But deciding whether to take out a new mortgage to buy a home is a big deal. Much of your financial life is changing as you transition from a steady paycheck to a mix of fixed and variable income and a new lifestyle. So adding a large debt to the picture isn\u2019t an easy call. That\u2019s especially true now that mortgage rates hover around 7% and home prices keep rising. \u201cAny time you take on debt, you increase risk in your situation,\u201d said Illinois-based certified financial planner Jim Stork. More than a third (35%) of homebuyers last year were between the ages of 59 and 98, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Within that group, a majority financed their purchases. Whether taking out a new mortgage makes sense for you depends on a lot of factors, including how to prove to a lender that you\u2019re a good credit risk, plus your feelings about the debt and the ongoing cost of maintaining a home. To get a mortgage, your age won\u2019t be a factor, but your income will be If you\u2019re concerned that you may be less attractive to a mortgage banker because you\u2019ve hit retirement age, know that it is illegal to discriminate against anyone applying for a mortgage based on their age. Lenders\u2019 chief focus will be on your ability to repay your mortgage with your various sources of non-paycheck income. \u201cWhen you qualify for a mortgage, it\u2019s all based on your income,\u201d said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage. That, and of course any debt you have that will soak up your income, but we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. The income sources that lenders consider, absent a regular paycheck, include: Social Security benefits, pension or annuity income, spousal benefits, disability payments, interest and dividends and your 401(k) or IRA. If a portion of your income is not subject to tax, the lender may treat it as worth 25% more. Fannie Mae offers this example: Say 15% of a $1,500 monthly Social Security benefit is tax free. That means $225 of it will not be subject to tax ($1,500 x 15%). And 25% of that amount comes to $56 ($225 x 25%). So that $56 can be added to a person\u2019s qualifying Social Security income amount ($1,500 + $56 = $1,556). If you want to use your nest egg, different methods can be used to calculate how much income it would provide. There is the asset depletion method in which your eligible assets are divided by your loan term. In the case of a 30-year mortgage, that would be 360 months. If your IRA is worth $700,000, that translates into $1,944 per month ($700,000/360). \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to take the money out \u2014 but you can use your assets [to qualify for a mortgage] as if you were going to take the distribution,\u201d Cohn said. Another option: If you are at least 59-1/2, you can start taking monthly distributions from an IRA without penalty \u2014 or a 401(k) if your plan rules permit \u2014 and the lender will count that as income so long as you show that you have sufficient funds in the account to keep taking that same monthly distribution for three years. Once you close on your home, Cohn said, you can reduce or stop taking distributions if you choose. That assumes you are not yet in your 70s when the IRS requires you to start taking minimum distributions, said Mark Luscombe, a principal analyst at Wolters, Kluwer Tax & Accounting. Burdened by debt? Lenders will also assess your debt-to-income ratio, because no matter how much income you have, the big question is how much of it will be consumed by your debts. The debt portion is composed of your expected mortgage payment plus any credit card, student loan, car loan or other outstanding debt you may have. Generally speaking, for conventional loans your DTI ratio can be up to 50%, Cohen said. That ratio falls to between 43% and 45% if you\u2019re taking out a jumbo loan, she added. A jumbo loan exceeds the conforming loan limits in the area you want to buy. But ideally your debt level will fall well below these top limits, both for the lender\u2019s sake and yours. And, of course, the higher your credit score, the better the interest rate you can get on a mortgage. What you should consider before taking out a mortgage Even before seeking a mortgage, get a good grasp on your expected monthly income and expenses in retirement. Compared to pre-retirement earnings, \u201cMost (new retirees) see a decrease in income,\u201d said certified financial planner Lori Trawinski, director of finance and employment at AARP. While some expenses may also decline \u2014 e.g., work-related costs like commuting \u2014 others may increase over time, Trawinski said, like medical costs, property taxes, home insurance and utilities. Of course, you can downsize and move to a lower-cost area. But if you stay near where you lived during your career, your expenses are likely to rise over time. Also, Trawinski noted, if you\u2019re married, consider what will happen to your household income when one spouse dies. This will help you assess your future comfort level in carrying a mortgage. \u201cPeople often fail to plan for the death of a spouse. You can take a big hit to your income when that happens,\u201d she said. If you do move to a new state or region, weigh renting first. You can get a better sense of the cost of living in the area and decide whether it\u2019s a good fit for you. As Stork put it, \u201cFlorida in August is not as fun as Florida in January.\u201d How much are you really willing to take on? All the usual financial decisions that go into homebuying apply no matter your age. But, in retirement especially, you don\u2019t want to take on more debt than necessary, since the cost of a mortgage is fixed, but the returns on your investments, the housing market and your health needs are variable. At the very least, Stork said, consider whether you can put enough money down \u2014 at least 20% \u2014 to avoid having to pay private mortgage insurance. Beyond that, consider whether you feel comfortable keeping up \u2014 and paying for \u2014 maintenance on a home. Maintenance might amount to 2% a year of your home\u2019s value, Stork said. That amounts to $10,000 a year on a $500,000 home. Maintenance is essential in preserving the value of your house should you ever decide to sell. How would your mortgage interest rate compare to a reasonable rate of return on your investments? The decision to get a mortgage was a lot easier for retirees when rates were historically low \u2014 roughly 3% \u2014 and their nest eggs were earning a lot more. \u201cBut at today\u2019s rates it\u2019s a much harder calculation,\u201d Stork said. This is especially the case if you\u2019re a very conservative investor. \u201cIf your CDs are earning 4% and a mortgage would cost you 7%, you will lose money every day on that decision,\u201d Stork explained. To get the truest reading on what makes financial sense, compare mortgage expenses to your investment returns on an after-tax basis, Stork noted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/success/buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_business_weight-loss-drugs-claims-nestle-food", "text": "As the use of popular weight loss and diabetes drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic skyrockets, consumer brands are scrambling to\u00a0adapt. But health professionals are warning consumers not to take medical advice from the same companies trying to sell them food, supplements and other consumables. The new GLP-1 drugs, as they\u2019re known, are prompting hopes \u2013 and fears \u2013 of a seismic shift in the food industry, potentially impacting what and how much people eat. JP Morgan said last year that users of the diabetes and weight loss drugs drugs \u2014 which help control blood sugar, slow digestion and suppress hunger \u2014 bought around 8% less food over the prior year compared with an average consumer. And a recent survey found that roughly one in eight adults in the United States has used a GLP-1 drug at some point, and that half of those \u2014 more than 15 million people \u2014 are currently using a prescription. The trend has raised alarm bells for the industry overall. \u201cPeople who are on (GLP-1 drugs) eat less calories. That\u2019s, high level, not good for people who sell calories,\u201d said Donny Kranson, portfolio manager and analyst at Vontobel Asset Management. GNC, the struggling vitamin and dietary supplement chain, is adding a dedicated section in its 2,300 US stores for people on GLP-1 medications. Daily Harvest, a meal kit service, has a GLP-1 food collection. Optavia, a branded diet plan, offers a GLP-1 support kit including nutrient dense meals and protein powder. Even food companies that are taking a more passive approach are keeping a close eye on trends, clocking items that sell well among GLP-1 users and flagging those products to Wall Street. Nestl\u00e9, the Switzerland-based food and supplement manufacturer, is taking a two-pronged approach. In May it announced a new line of frozen meals called Vital Pursuit, pitching the brand to users of weight loss drugs. The brand will include meals high in protein and fiber that are \u201cintended to be a companion for GLP-1 weight loss medication users and consumers focused on weight management.\u201d More recently, it launched a website \u2014 www.glp-1nutrition.com \u2014 which it billed as a resource for people managing their weight and using the medications. \u201cThese companies all need to find where the growth is in food,\u201d noted Kranson. But the tactic could hurt GLP-1 users who may unwittingly take medical advice from a retail site primarily interested in selling products. At best \u2018a waste of money\u2019 A visitor to Nestl\u00e9\u2019s GLP-1 nutrition site might not realize right away that it\u2019s run by Nestl\u00e9. The company\u2019s name is not in the URL. On the home page, it only appears at the very bottom. The site offers \u201cexpert tips\u201d and other information and sells an assortment of products from different brands, which don\u2019t appear to all have the same parent company. Visitors invited to \u201cBuild your GLP-1 bundle\u201d can add products to their shopping carts based on categories that correlate with potential side effects of the drugs. Some taking GLP-1 drugs have reported losing hair and muscle. In some cases, use of the drug has led to vomiting, which can be dehydrating. So the site sells protein shakes in \u201cmuscle preservation,\u201d branded hydration tablets in \u201chydration,\u201d hair growth capsules in \u201chair and skin health,\u201d and so on. But there\u2019s no evidence that everyone using GLP-1 medications should also take supplements, said Dr. Jorge Moreno, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Medicine who specializes in obesity. \u201cAdditional supplements for patients on GLP-1s are not universally recommended,\u201d he said. Physicians may advise patients take probiotics or increase their protein intake in specific situations, he said. Furthermore, \u201csupplements can have side effects on patients, and not really be beneficial to them directly,\u201d he said. Direct-to-consumer websites like Nestl\u00e9\u2019s \u201cmay at best be harmless and a waste of money,\u201d said Dr. Jody Dushay, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and an endocrinologist with a clinical practice focusing on medical weight management. At worst, they could lead someone to try to treat potentially severe symptoms with supplements, rather than going to a doctor. \u201cYou can really get yourself into trouble if you are malnourished, if you are someone who is losing a lot of muscle,\u201d she said, referring to some extreme reported side effects of GLP-1 drugs. Patients who think they might be experiencing side effects like these need guidance from their physicians to figure out what\u2019s going on. \u201cI\u2019m just extremely, extremely wary of this,\u201d she added in reference to Nestl\u00e9\u2019s site. \u201cAnd I think that it\u2019s probably just the tip of what\u2019s to come.\u201d In a statement, a Nestl\u00e9 spokesperson said that \u201cexpert insights provided on the site are from accredited medical doctors; however, the site is not intended to replace the advice of an individual\u2019s healthcare professional,\u201d adding that \u201cwe advise all GLP-1 users to consult with their healthcare professionals about the appropriate nutrition for them.\u201d The statement also pointed out that a disclaimer on the bottom of each page reinforces this position. \u201cGLP-1nutrition.com\u00a0was created to offer\u00a0nutrition information and a wide range of product options to help support the unique nutritional needs of individuals on a weight management journey, including those on GLP-1 therapy,\u201d the statement said. A lot of unknowns It\u2019s not unusual for businesses to try to profit off of consumer trends. Chipotle has a whole line of menu items that cater to different diet trends. The Atkins diet started as a meal planning system (popularly named after the cardiologist, Robert Atkins, who created it in the 1970s), but it soon became a company devoted to selling low-carb products. The keto trend gave rise to brands devoted to selling products that fit the strict regimen. Nestl\u00e9 has made clear that it sees potential in consumers trying to lose weight. \u201cYou can expect a continued new stream of products to address that need,\u201d CEO Mark Schneider told journalists in February. Conagra, which owns frozen food brands Marie Callender\u2019s, Birds Eye and Banquet, and other food and snack brands including Slim Jim and Orville Redenbacher\u2019s, is optimistic about its own frozen offerings. \u201cWe see opportunity within our portfolio,\u201d said Tom McGough, now the company\u2019s chief operating officer, during a February analyst event, citing data that shows GLP-1 users are more likely to buy certain frozen foods. That\u2019s because \u201cfrozen meals are portion-controlled, they provide vegetable nutrition and they\u2019re high in protein,\u201d he said. He also said that \u201camong GLP-1 users, consumption of both meat snacks and popcorn increase.\u201d  A Danone executive recently told Bloomberg that the company\u2019s protein yogurts \u201care flying off the shelf,\u201d thanks in part to GLP-1 users. Confident as these companies may seem, it\u2019s still too soon to tell how GLP-1s will impact users\u2019 diets in the long-term. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how the diets of people on GLP-1s change,\u201d said Dr. William Dietz, director of the STOP Obesity Alliance at George Washington University. \u201cThey could change substantially in ways that either are fine for their health or have an adverse effect on their health.\u201d Sites like Nestl\u00e9\u2019s that market supplements to GLP-1 users are \u201can attempt to really jump into this space and try to create a business based on very little data\u201d about how diets should be supplemented, if at all, he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/business/weight-loss-drugs-claims-nestle-food/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_business_former-boeing-inspector-scrap-parts-assembly-lines", "text": "A former Boeing quality-control manager alleges that for years workers at its 787 Dreamliner factory in Everett, Washington, routinely took parts that were deemed unsuitable to fly out of an internal scrap yard and put them back on factory assembly lines\u00a0. In his first network TV interview, Merle Meyers, a 30-year veteran of Boeing, described to CNN what he says was an elaborate off-the-books practice that Boeing managers at the Everett factory used to meet production deadlines, including taking\u00a0damaged and improper parts from the company\u2019s scrapyard, storehouses and loading docks. A string of whistleblowers this year has raised allegations about Boeing factory lapses, including an official federal complaint\u00a0from a current employee\u00a0that Boeing hid potentially defective parts from Federal Aviation Administration inspectors, and that some of those parts likely ended up in planes. This all comes in the wake of a series of highly public safety issues that have rocked the company. Meyers\u2019 claims that lapses he witnessed\u00a0were intentional, organized efforts designed to thwart quality control processes in an effort to keep\u00a0up with demanding production schedules. Beginning in the early 2000s, Meyers says that for more than a decade, he estimates that about 50,000 parts \u201cescaped\u201d quality control\u00a0and were used to build aircraft. Those parts include everything from small items like screws to more complex assemblies like wing flaps. A single Boeing 787 Dreamliner, for example, has approximately 2.3 million parts. Most of the parts that were meant to be scrapped were often painted red to signify they were unsuitable for assembly lines, Meyers said. Yet, in some cases, that didn\u2019t stop them\u00a0 from being put into planes being assembled, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem,\u201d Meyers told CNN. \u201cA core requirement of a quality system is to keep bad parts and good parts apart.\u201d Airplanes are highly specified machines with much stricter safety standards than trains and cars. Their parts, materials and manufacturing processes are highly regulated. Meyers, whose job was to find quality problems at Boeing, says he believes he was forced out last year and says he was given a severance package that he is unable to discuss due to a privacy agreement he signed with Boeing. Based on conversations Meyers says he had with current Boeing workers in the time since he left the company, he believes that while employees no longer remove parts from the scrapyard, the practice of using other unapproved\u00a0parts in assembly lines continues. \u201cNow they\u2019re back to taking parts of body sections \u2013 everything \u2013 right when it arrives at the Everett site, bypassing quality, going right to the airplane,\u201d Meyers said. Company emails going back years show that Meyers repeatedly flagged the issue to Boeing\u2019s corporate investigations team, pointing out what he says were blatant violations of Boeing\u2019s safety rules. But investigators\u00a0routinely failed to enforce those rules, Meyers says, even ignoring \u201ceye witness observations\u00a0and the hard work done to ensure the safety of future passengers and crew,\u201d he wrote in an internal 2022 email provided to CNN. Meyers has also described his concerns about Boeing\u2019s quality issues to federal investigators, a Senate panel and the New York Times. In a statement to CNN, Boeing did not dispute Meyers\u2019 allegations. The company said it investigates \u201call allegations of improper behavior, such as unauthorized movement of parts or mishandling of documents,\u201d and makes improvements when appropriate. Swirl of controversy Meyers\u2019 allegations come as Boeing faces a swirl of controversy over its safety culture, including a criminal investigation into whether it misled the FAA over its 2017 certification of the 737 Max. A total of 346 people were killed in two 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019. As CNN reported over the weekend, the Justice Department is nearing an agreement with Boeing which would resolve potential criminal liability. In January, a door plug blew off of a 737 Max mid-flight, prompting a wave of intense scrutiny of the airplane manufacturer, including federal and congressional investigations. Boeing\u2019s CEO Dave Calhoun has announced he will step down by the end of this year. To address its safety issues, Boeing recently agreed to purchase supplier Spirit AeroSystems. Since January a number of whistleblowers have come forward with fresh allegations against Boeing. A current Boeing quality investigator, Sam Mohawk, also filed an official complaint last month reporting \u201ca number of non-compliant parts making their way back to the airplanes for installation.\u201d His complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration was publicly released by a Senate subcommittee investigating Boeing. Mohawk\u2019s complaint said the issue of disappearing nonconforming parts continues.\u00a0\u201cBoeing is still losing parts to this day,\u201d his official complaint reads. A separate whistleblower, Richard Cuevas, last week made public his concerns that Boeing and its key supplier Spirit Aerosystems used compromised parts and made changes to \u201creduce bottlenecks in production and speed up production and delivery.\u201d Pulled from the scrapyard The pressure from Boeing management to keep assembly lines moving is no secret.\u00a0The 245-page House investigative report after the 737 Max fatal crashes dedicates an entire chapter to \u201cProduction Pressure.\u201d\u00a0After the January 5 door plug blowout on a 737 Max, the FAA capped\u00a0Boeing\u2019s production line speed. Meyers describes a pressure-packed environment at the Everett factory, where assembly teams competed with each other to find the parts they needed. Meyers alleges that after hours, workers would ask security guards to unlock doors and sneak parts out of supply rooms, or remove newly arrived components awaiting quality inspections by Meyers\u2019 team.\u00a0Similar parts destined for a different airplane model were ripe for the taking. At some point in the early 2000s, Boeing employees began also pulling parts from the company\u2019s scrapyard in Auburn, Washington, located about an hour south\u00a0of the nearly 100-acre factory building\u00a0where Dreamliners were assembled,\u00a0according to documentation\u00a0Meyers shared with CNN. Nonconforming parts end up in the reclamation yard, Meyers says, only after being\u00a0rejected by three departments:\u00a0Engineering, procurement, and quality. Meyers claims that by around 2002, employees at the reclamation yard became concerned that they would be considered responsible when scrap parts were later found on an aircraft.\u00a0So, they asked employees to sign for the removals \u2013 but their homemade form wasn\u2019t an official Boeing document, which meant the removal was never recorded in the company\u2019s quality management database. \u201cThese are bootleg forms that are not Boeing authorized,\u201d Meyers said.\u00a0\u201cThe procurement organization would go down to our scrap reclamation yard and intimidate the employees there and say we need these parts bad.\u201d Lack of enforcement Meyers says he repeatedly referred violations for investigation but found the company\u2019s efforts to look into them lacking. \u201cTheir investigations are about analyzing excuses by process violators, and not taking action against those committing compliance violations,\u201d Meyers wrote in a 2002 email to corporate HR at Boeing\u00a0. In its statement, Boeing said the quality team Meyers worked on \u201cplays an important role in identifying issues, improving processes, and strengthening compliance in our factories.\u201d \u201cWe appreciate employees who raise their voice and we have systems in place to encourage them to speak up confidentially or anonymously,\u201d the statement said. Meyers says his Boeing managers did not know how to handle employees who raised concerns, and said that after decades at the company he was ultimately given\u00a0a list of management grievances with his work, and offered a vague opportunity to improve \u2013 or take a cash payout and leave. \u201cI was given a list of things to correct \u2013 it was my behaviors and my practices as a manager,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cSo it looked like a personal improvement program \u2026 but it had a financial incentive with it \u2013 or you can take this money and quit.\u201d Meyers said he never intended to become a whistleblower but is now speaking with those who ask \u2013 including a Senate subcommittee probing Boeing \u2013 to generate momentum for change. \u201cHopefully we can get this company to heal and be what it was,\u201d he said.

Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment (CSSE) revealed in a filing that it has nearly $1 billion in debt and owes millions of dollars to several entertainment companies including the BBC and Sony Pictures, plus to retailers ranging from Walmart to Walgreens. Filings show that the company took on about $325 million in debt following its purchase of Redbox in 2022 from private equity giant Apollo Global Management. The plan was to make it into an entertainment conglomerate, combining the DVD rental business with its free streaming services, like Crackle, the entertainment platform once owned by Sony. Those plans didn\u2019t pan out, hindered by dual Hollywood strikes that limited production of fresh content and the decline of people renting physical DVDs that even forced rival Netflix to quit that part of its business last year. CSSE declined to comment. Deadline previously reported that Redbox hadn\u2019t paid employees for a week, and medical benefits have been suspended. Filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy could help the company fix those issues if its plans are approved by a court in Delaware.

{"id": "2024_06_13_success_gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy", "text": "Employees\u2019 negative daily emotions and lack of well-being can ultimately hurt worker engagement \u2013 and the economy, according to a new report released this week. Gallup, in its \u201cState of the Global Workplace,\u201d estimates that low employee engagement costs the global economy $8.9 trillion, or 9% of global GDP. The report includes findings from its latest annual World Poll, which surveyed 128,278 employees in more than 140 countries last year. That poll found that roughly 20% of workers globally reported feeling lonely, angry or sad on a daily basis. And 41% on average say they feel stress. Those most likely to say they feel lonely were younger workers (22%), employees who worked remotely full-time (25%) and those who felt most disengaged on the job (31%). While work isn\u2019t always the cause of a person\u2019s negative daily emotions, employers should still be concerned. That\u2019s because work can either improve or worsen employees\u2019 well-being. On the one hand,\u00a0the Gallup report noted,\u00a0\u201cwhen employees find their work and work relationships meaningful, employment is associated with high levels of daily enjoyment and low levels of all negative daily emotions. Notably, half of employees who are engaged at work are thriving in life overall.\u201d On the other, researchers found that being disengaged at work can negatively affect a person\u2019s wellbeing as much as \u2014 or more than \u2014 not having a job at all. \u201cEmployees who dislike their jobs tend to have high levels of daily stress and worry, as well as elevated levels of all other negative emotions,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOn many wellbeing items (stress, anger, worry, loneliness), being actively disengaged at work is equivalent to or worse than being unemployed.\u201d Engaged managers help workers thrive The poll found that last year only 23% of employees were engaged at work, unchanged from the year prior. Gallup defines an engaged employee as someone \u201chighly involved in and enthusiastic about their work and workplace. They are psychological \u2018owners,\u2019 drive performance and innovation, and move the organization forward.\u201d But those who said they were not engaged rose by 3 percentage points to 62%. These are employees characterized as \u201cpsychologically unattached to their work and company. Because their engagement needs are not being fully met, they are putting time but not energy or passion into their work.\u201d Engagement levels are highest in so-called \u201cbest practice\u201d organizations, where three-fourths of managers on average are engaged as well as seven in 10 non-managers, Gallup said. Their best practices include leaders\u2019 emphasizing well-being at work and in life; and putting a high priority on manager hiring and development. The manager piece of the equation is especially crucial. \u201c[W]hen managers are engaged, employees are more likely to be engaged,\u201d the report said. And, it added, \u201chigh-engagement business units are likely to see significantly higher employee wellbeing \u2014 as well as higher productivity, profitability and sales \u2014 than low-engagement teams.\u201d Where the most and least stressed workers are Engagement and well-being results varied in each of the 10 regions covered by Gallup\u2019s poll. The report noted that the United States and Canada, for example, showed the highest percentage of engaged employees (33%) among all the regions studied; and the third highest percentage of thriving employees (53%), behind Australia and New Zealand (60%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (54%). But the US and Canada also ranked second among employees experiencing daily stress (49%), right behind the Middle East and North Africa (52%). By contrast, Europe showed the lowest level of employee engagement (13%). South Asia scored lowest in terms of employees described as thriving overall (13%). And countries in post-Soviet Eurasia ranked lowest in terms of daily stress (19%).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/success/gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_04_24_tech_nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc", "text": "Texting on the Moon? Streaming on Mars? It may not be as far away as you think. That\u2019s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets. A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year \u2014 the exact date has yet to be confirmed \u2014 carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon\u2019s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth. \u201cThe first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,\u201d Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation. The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia\u2019s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice. One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice. Images of ice \u2014 transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network \u2014 would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon. For NASA\u2019s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable. Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund \u2014 especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated. \u201cBeing able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis \u2014 as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,\u201d said Engelund. \u201cEventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.\u201d It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth\u2019s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing \ufeffspace colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth. NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy. Bell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the \u201cframework for the lunar economy.\u201d \u201cA future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,\u201d Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN. \u201cThis includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.\u201d There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too. If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth \u2014 such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms. \u201cEspecially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,\u201d Klein said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/tech/nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_business_economy-election-presidential-debate", "text": "Bill Clinton\u2019s campaign was right on the money when it coined the famous \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d phrase in 1992. That\u2019s because the economy has consistently ranked among the top \u2014 if not the very top \u2014 voter issues in presidential election after presidential election. The current contest is far from an exception, with close to 90% of respondents in a May ABC News/Ipsos poll indicating that the economy is the most important issue in determining who gets their vote in November. That means it\u2019s all but guaranteed to be a major talking point during Thursday night\u2019s debate, which kicks off at 9 pm ET on CNN. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have polar opposite views on the economy \u2014 and both undoubtedly will try to sell you on their visions, policies and records. To make heads or tails of what they say (or if you\u2019re trying to impress anyone you might be watching the debate with), it\u2019s good to make sure you understand the economy we\u2019re in right now. Disclaimer: The topics below are in no way an exhaustive list of everything going on in the US economy, plus, everyone experiences it differently. Unemployment: Low, but with warning signs ahead The nation\u2019s unemployment rate stayed below 4% for 27 months, its longest such streak and a match for a period in the 1960s. That streak ended last month, when the unemployment rate rose to 4% from 3.9%. At the same time, the number of job openings in the US recently fell to a new three-year low, another sign of cooling in the labor market. That means job seekers might find it harder to get hired. In particular, the job market for recent college graduates has weakened. The unemployment rate for bachelor\u2019s degree recipients aged 20 to 29 is above 12%, an almost four-percentage-point increase from a year ago, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Inflation: Elevated, but cooling Inflation slowed more than expected last month, falling to 3.3% from 3.4% in April. By comparison, at this time last year it was 4%, and two years ago it was 9%. But there\u2019s a reason why you\u2019re probably feeling like everything is still really expensive. While discounts are starting to appear more at big-box retailers like Target and Walmart and fast-food giants like McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s, price cuts aren\u2019t occurring across the board. That\u2019s because when inflation cools off, it simply means that the pace of price increases is slowing. However, it does not mean that the actual prices we pay for goods and services are lower than they were a year ago. Housing: Still unaffordable Home prices are at a record high and have been climbing for 11 straight months as housing shortages persist. That\u2019s partly because many homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgages during the pandemic don\u2019t want to move and risk having to pay a much higher mortgage rate. Average 30-year fixed-rate mortgages recently hit the highest level of the year. While they\u2019ve started to fall, mortgage rates are still higher than anything seen in the decade before 2022. Mortgage rates are so high in part because inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. As a result, the central bank has held off cutting interest rates, which would otherwise make it cheaper to get a mortgage. In turn, many would-be homebuyers are renting for longer than they otherwise may have, which is driving rents higher, too.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/business/economy-election-presidential-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/04/2024", "section": "business"}}
