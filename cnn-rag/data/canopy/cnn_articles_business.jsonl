The scandal, which implicates China\u2019s largest grain storage and transport company Sinograin, and private conglomerate Hopefull Grain and Oil Group, has raised concerns of food contamination in a country rocked in recent decades by a string of food and drug safety scares \u2013 and evoked harsh criticism from Chinese state media. It was an \u201copen secret\u201d in the transport industry that the tankers were doing double duty, according to a report in the state-linked outlet Beijing News last week, which alleged that\u00a0trucks carrying certain fuel or chemical liquids were also used to transport edible liquids such as cooking oil, syrup and soybean oil, without proper cleaning procedures. On Tuesday, the food safety office of China\u2019s administrative State Council announced an interdepartmental team would investigate the transportation of\u00a0edible oil, pledging that those responsible for any malpractice \u201cwill be severely punished in accordance with the law,\u201d according to a statement posted on the website of the top market regulator. The two companies named in the media report have also said investigations are underway. Meanwhile, other major edible oil manufacturers not named in the report issued statements saying they did not use fuel trucks to transport their products. Food security and safety have been cornerstone issues for Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who has linked them to national stability and called their successful oversight a test of a government\u2019s ability to govern. As discussion of the claims exploded across social media in recent days, China\u2019s tightly controlled national-level state media also rushed to criticize alleged malpractice \u2013 in a sign the state wanted to be seen driving condemnation of the issue, as opposed to acting to tamp down public anger. State broadcaster CCTV earlier this week called the alleged practice and the potential contamination of food products from left-behind fuel in the tankers \u201ctantamount to poisoning\u201d and showing \u201cextreme disregard for consumers\u2019 lives and health.\u201d Communist Party mouthpiece the People\u2019s Daily said when food safety is at stake there is \u201cno right to silence\u201d and called on regulators to act. Experts quoted in official media also discussed health hazards of the alleged practices. \u201cUsing chemical tankers for edible oils will inevitably result in residual contamination,\u201d said Liu Shaowei, a food safety expert cited by CCTV. Long-term consumption of the oils with chemical residues can lead to poisoning with symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It may even cause irreversible damage to organs including the liver and kidneys, Liu added, according to the broadcaster. Public backlash and investigations On China\u2019s heavily moderated social media platforms, many members of the public called for product recalls and greater industry oversight. Some also appeared to link the situation to broader issues in the country, where an economic downturn is driving social frustration and there are deep-seated concerns about the limits of accountability for powerful and government-linked entities. \u201cEven the cooking oil essential to people\u2019s daily lives has now become problematic\u2026 Ordinary people cannot be properly safeguarded\u2026 Now I just want to scoff at (phrases like) \u2018rule of law\u2019 and \u2018serving the people\u2019 whenever I see them,\u201d read one comment on China\u2019s X-like social media platform Weibo, that garnered thousands of likes. As public anger simmered, state-owned Sinograin on Saturday said it had launched inspections across its operations and pledged to stop working with any transport providers found to be in violation of safety regulations. \u201cSinograin requires all units in the system to strictly fulfill their responsibilities, abide by work standards and prevent contamination risks to grain and oil reserves,\u201d the company, China\u2019s official grain stockpiler, said in a statement posted on its official Weibo account. A staff member from Hopefull Grain and Oil Group on Monday told state-owned news outlet Economic View that \u201crelevant departments\u201d have investigated the matter and would make an official announcement. The person added that a tanker described in the media report was not owned by the company and said there were no quality issues with their brand\u2019s oil products, according to the Economic View. CNN was not able to reach Hopefull Grain and Oil Group despite repeated calls. When reached by phone by CNN, a representative from Sinograin declined to provide additional comment past its online statement. There has been no official announcement of product recalls. However, CNN found no products were available to buy on the official store of Sinograin\u2019s Jinding cooking oil brand on e-commerce platform Taobao on Wednesday afternoon, though it was unclear why. Experts cited by state media noted that while China has no specific law governing the transport procedures of edible oils, national guidelines say transporters should use \u201cdedicated containers, and non-edible vegetable oil tank trucks and containers are strictly prohibited for this purpose.\u201d Meanwhile, China\u2019s Food Safety Law requires that food \u201cmust not be stored or transported together with toxic or harmful items\u201d and mixing toxic and harmful non-edible raw materials is a criminal offense punishable by a potentially lengthy prison sentence. Those found guilty of food poisoning resulting in a fatality can face the death penalty. Food safety \u2018a major test\u2019 Despite rising living standards in recent decades, food safety has been an ongoing issue in China, where dozens of high-profile scandals have been reported by local media since the early 2000s, sparking tighter government regulation. In one of the most egregious examples, six infants died and some 300,000 others were sickened by milk powder formula containing the toxic industrial chemical melamine. Several executives found to be responsible for the 2008 case were ultimately handed death sentences, and the tragedy drove deep mistrust of domestic products and food safety in China. The widespread sale and use of \u201cgutter oil\u201d \u2013 or cooking oil recycled from the gutter, household drains and grease traps \u2013 emerged as a major issue in the early 2010s. Another case in 2022, also exposed by state media, showed how \u201cdirty\u201d pickled cabbage was supplied to popular instant noodle brands. Xi has repeatedly stressed the importance of food safety and the security of grain and food staple supplies. In a 2013 speech cited in a People\u2019s Daily report last year, Xi said the ruling Communist Party\u2019s ability to \u201cprovide satisfactory assurances on food safety\u201d is a \u201cmajor test of our governance capabilities.\u201d \u201cAs the ruling party in China, if we cannot manage something as fundamental as food safety, and if we cannot address the issue and even allow it to persist without proper resolution over a long period, the party\u2019s ability to govern will be challenged,\u201d Xi said. Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, said the directive to investigate the current scandal likely came \u201cfrom the very top\u201d \u2013 noting that food safety is both a key issue linked to government legitimacy and the allegations are landing at a sensitive time when economic hardship in China is causing a more \u201cvolatile society.\u201d The situation, Huang added, had the potential to be the largest food safety scandal since 2008, given the volume of oil regularly transported and the implication that this may have been a longstanding issue that could have affected swaths of the population. \u201cThis problem is even worse (than some past scandals) because you can avoid eating gutter oil, for example, by not dining out, but you cannot avoid the contaminated cooking oil, because it\u2019s difficult to identify and to avoid in everyday meals,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why people have become so upset.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/food/china-oil-food-safety-scandal-sinograin-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sent investors mixed messages on Tuesday during his semiannual testimony to Congress. Speaking before Congress, he said that the central bank doesn\u2019t expect to cut interest rates \u201cuntil we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.\u201d But, he noted, inflation readings have come down significantly from the four-decade highs they reached two years ago. The US economy is cooling, and \u201cmore good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.\u201d So what can Wall Street decipher from his first day of testimony? Here are a few key takeaways. Powell is stressed about the election: Powell was asked by multiple senators about White House politics, which he dodged. When asked about so-called Bidenomics, for example, he commented that\u00a0\u201cI wouldn\u2019t touch a sentence with that word in it.\u201d But it\u2019s hard to avoid politics when former President Donald Trump has said that if elected he would not reappoint Powell and accused Powell of considering rate cuts to give Democrats an advantage in the 2024 elections. That might be why Powell made sure to stress that the central bank is an independent entity on Tuesday. \u201cCongress has entrusted the Federal Reserve with the operational independence that is needed to take a longer-term perspective in the pursuit of our dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices,\u201d said Powell. The Fed\u2019s independence is reassuring for American and global capital markets, said Joseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist at RSM US. That\u2019s because investors need to believe that central banks will be dependable and do what\u2019s best for the economy instead of stimulating economies and impacting markets ahead of elections. \u201cOne gets the idea that the Federal Reserve is laying down a marker ahead of the upcoming presidential election,\u201d said Brusuelas. \u201cIn an era of economic populism, and the possible advent of a second Trump administration, the idea of central bank independence is far more important than is commonly understood or appreciated among elected actors and the public.\u201d Inflation is no longer the only risk: Powell\u2019s messaging on Tuesday was largely consistent with his most recent communication about Fed policy \u2013 with one major exception. Powell subtly signaled his desire to start \u201crecalibrating monetary policy,\u201d said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco. While the Fed head noted that policy decisions are data dependent, \u201celevated inflation is not the only risk we face,\u201d he said. \u201cReducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.\u201d While the economy and labor market remain strong, US job growth slowed in June, according to the latest employment data. That\u2019s caused some analysts to fret about the Fed\u2019s timing for rate cuts \u2013 if the central bank waits too long it could send the economy into recession. \u201cWe know the economy\u2019s performance has been remarkable. What policymakers need to evaluate is how inflation and labor market conditions will fare in the coming months,\u201d said Daco. Market reaction was muted, but yields are up: Powell\u2019s acknowledgement that higher-for-longer interest rates could jeopardize the economy should have been good news to investors eager for rate cuts. But that message was tempered by \u201chis mantra that the Fed is still waiting for more evidence that inflation is cooling reliably before it acts,\u201d said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley. As a result, investors mostly yawned on Tuesday. The S&P 500 closed the day less than 0.1% higher. \u201cThe fact that the S&P 500 mostly drifted sideways during his testimony suggests traders are looking ahead to the inflation numbers,\u201d said Larkin, referring to US Consumer Price Index data due later this week. That data will help investors discern whether more progress has been made in the Fed\u2019s fight against inflation. Treasury yields, however, moved higher on Tuesday, indicating that investors don\u2019t think a rate cut will happen in the next few meetings. The September Fed meeting will be \u201clive\u201d: Powell noted multiple times that every Fed policy decision is made \u201clive\u201d using the latest available economic data \u2013 in other words, decisions aren\u2019t made in advance. But investors still believe that the outcome of July\u2019s meeting is set: 95% are betting that the Fed will keep rates the same, according to the CME FedWatch tool. September, however, is little more of a toss-up. About 75% of investors think the Fed will cut rates, and about 25% think they\u2019ll remain the same. There\u2019s more to come: We\u2019ll be seeing a lot more from Powell ahead of that September meeting. The Fed chair continues his testimony in front of Congress on Wednesday. Powell\u2019s social calendar remains full through the end of the month: Next Monday he\u2019ll join David Rubenstein for a \u201cwide-ranging interview on the current state of the US and global economy\u201d at the Economics club in Washington DC, and he\u2019ll host his regular press conference following the Fed\u2019s late-July policy meeting. In August, he\u2019ll speak at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. That means there\u2019s plenty of time for the Fed to recalibrate their messaging and temper market expectations. No room for privacy: How Airbnb fails to protect guests from hidden cameras It was another lawsuit brought by another victim whose fun-filled vacation turned into a voyeuristic nightmare: A woman was secretly recorded undressing at a rental property, her images stored on the computer of an alleged sexual predator accused of spying on unsuspecting renters for years. Airbnb, one of the world\u2019s largest short-term rental companies, had seen this sort of scenario before. Typically, the company seeks to settle hidden camera cases quickly and confidentially. But this one played out differently. An Airbnb representative testifying at a court-ordered deposition early last year offered a rare glimpse of the company\u2019s hidden camera problem: Airbnb has generated tens of thousands of customer support tickets related to surveillance devices in the last decade. During the hours-long deposition, the Airbnb employee also revealed that when a guest complains of a hidden camera, the company doesn\u2019t \u2013 as a matter of practice \u2013 notify law enforcement, not even when a child is involved. The company may, however, reach out to hosts about complaints as part of internal inquiries \u2013 a move law enforcement experts say could hinder criminal investigations because it gives suspects time to destroy evidence. A CNN investigation found that Airbnb consistently fails to protect its guests despite knowing hidden cameras are a persistent concern within its industry. Airbnb\u2019s corporate strategies, moreover, have been aimed at preventing regulation of the short-term rental market to allow the company to distance itself from responsibility for guest safety and privacy.

Boeing sold just three passenger jets in the past month Boeing said it sold just 14 new jets in the past month, with most of those coming as freighter sales, reports my colleague Chris Isidore. One of those was to replace the plane that saw a door plug blow out mid-flight just over six months ago. It sold just three 737 Max jets, two to an unidentified customer and one to Alaska Airlines to replace the plane that had a\u00a0door plug blow out\u00a0on a January 5 flight as it approached 16,000 feet. The other 11 jets were 777 freighters. It marked one of its best sales months of the year, but it still ended the first half of 2024 with gross sales down 70% from a year ago. The 14 gross sales are up from the only four sold in May and seven in April. But it\u2019s down 95% from the 304 gross orders it took in in June of 2023. Boeing\u2019s sales have fallen sharply in the wake of the Alaska Air incident, as even airlines eager to expand their fleets hold off on purchases while Boeing works through a myriad of problems.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices", "text": "Actress Judy Garland never recorded her voice to read an audiobook of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but you\u2019ll soon be able to hear her rendition of the children\u2019s novel that inspired the movie nonetheless. Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_business_bill-hwang-archegos", "text": "In lower Manhattan, a jury is now weighing a case against a little-known investor who made it big, lost everything, and briefly brought Wall Street to its knees. But the story of Bill Hwang and his trading firm\u2019s colossal failure is more than a rags-to-riches-to-rags tale \u2014 it is also a giant red flag about the vulnerabilities of the financial system that persist more than 15 years after Wall Street\u2019s everyday dark arts ravaged the global economy. Here\u2019s the deal: In March of 2021, as most of us were lining up for Covid vaccines, Bill Hwang\u2019s so-called family office \u2014 an unregulated firm that works like a hedge fund \u2014 imploded in a matter of days, sparking a brief but acute freakout in financial markets. Seemingly without anyone noticing, Hwang had managed to amass huge positions in a handful of companies \u2014 including ViacomCBS, Tencent and Discovery (now Warner Bros. Discovery, CNN\u2019s parent company). His positions were so large that when the stocks started falling, it had a seismic effect on the market. According to prosecutors, the collapse of Archegos (pronounced ar-KAY-gos) cost shareholders $100 billion and left major banks with $10 billion in losses. Hwang and his CFO, Patrick Halligan, were later charged with racketeering conspiracy and securities fraud. And on Tuesday, after a two-month trial in New York federal court, the case was handed over to a jury that will decide their fate. What happened? There are two official versions of the Archegos saga that emerged from the trial. Prosecutors say that the firm used financial instruments called \u201ctotal return swaps\u201d to gain exposure to stocks without actually owning them (a legal but controversial strategy), all while lying to the banks it was borrowing from (not legal) to conceal its massive positions and artificially inflating the stocks\u2019 value (also not legal). Hwang\u2019s attorneys counter that Archegos\u2019 aggressive trades were actually commonplace and perfectly legal, and that he believed in the stocks he was buying. It can\u2019t be a pump-and-dump scheme if the investor never dumps the shares, after all. What happened to Hwang and his firm was an aggressive bet that went south due to a perfect storm of market movements that left the firm unable to meet margin calls from its lenders. That forced the banks to sell Hwang\u2019s holdings, which caused the stocks\u2019 value to plummet, and the chaos to ensue. If found guilty, Hwang and Halligan could face as much as 20 years in prison under federal sentencing guidelines. Big picture The details of the Archegos trial may appear arcane to outsiders. Even the judge admonished prosecutors for \u201cboring the jury to tears,\u201d according to Bloomberg. But the Archegos episode is one of the more significant white-collar cases to emerge since the financial crisis. The case has shown the world, once again, what happens when two giant market risks collide in a novel way, Josh Naftalis, a former prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, told me. Before Archegos, market watchers knew unregulated family offices were a problem, and they knew that swaps going unreported was a problem. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think anyone put two and two together to say you could just use these two and light a dumpster on fire,\u201d said Naftalis, now with the law firm Pallas Partners. Regardless of the verdict, the case also underscores the massive risks that Wall Street megabanks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley continue to pile on, said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of the non-profit Better Markets, in an interview. Even if Wang is convicted, he said, there\u2019s another culprit in the saga getting off easy: the taxpayer-backed banks that enabled the trading in the first place. \u201cFifteen years after the global financial crash, we still have gross under-regulation of non-banks, and we have Wall Street megabanks engaged in high-risk activities that aren\u2019t properly regulated,\u201d Kelleher told me. \u201cWe still have a long, long way to go.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/business/bill-hwang-archegos/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

The university said it \u201ctakes seriously all allegations of discrimination, confirms that NYU treats all allegations of discrimination against Jews and Israelis in the same manner that it treats conduct prohibited under Title VI and other civil rights statutes when directed at other protected groups.\u201d In the lawsuit, Bella Ingber, Sabrina Maslavi and Saul Tawil, each a junior attending NYU, alleged that NYU created a hostile educational environment that subjected them and other Jewish students to \u201cpervasive acts of hatred, discrimination, harassment, and intimidation\u201d in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The settlement also creates a new \u201cTitle VI Coordinator\u201d position that ensures the university \u201cresponds adequately and consistently to allegations of discrimination and harassment based on all protected traits.\u201d They will also be tasked in creating an annual report about disciplinary data and another report that examines NYU\u2019s disciplinary responses to \u201callegations of discrimination or harassment\u201d since 2018.

Microsoft took a\u00a0non-voting, observer position\u00a0on OpenAI\u2019s board in November last year after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took back the reins of the company, which operates the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT. The seat meant it could attend OpenAI\u2019s board meetings and access confidential information but had no voting rights on matters including electing or choosing directors. The observer seat and Microsoft\u2019s more than $10 billion investment in OpenAI have triggered unease among antitrust watchdogs in Europe, Britain and the US over how much control it exerts over OpenAI.

Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,\u201d it said in a letter to OpenAI dated July 9. EU antitrust regulators last month said the partnership would not be subjected to the bloc\u2019s merger rules\u00a0because Microsoft does not control OpenAI, but they would instead seek third-party views on the exclusivity clauses in the agreement. In contrast, the\u00a0British\u00a0and US antitrust watchdogs continue to have concerns as well as questions about Microsoft\u2019s influence over OpenAI and the latter\u2019s independence. Microsoft and OpenAI are increasingly competing to sell AI technology to enterprise customers, aiming to generate revenue and demonstrate their independence to regulators to address antitrust concerns. Additionally, Microsoft is expanding its AI offerings on the Azure platform and has hired Inflection\u2019s CEO to head its consumer AI division, a move widely interpreted as an effort to diversify beyond OpenAI.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/tech/microsoft-openai-board-observer-seat/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

That\u2019s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets. A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year \u2014 the exact date has yet to be confirmed \u2014 carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon\u2019s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth. \u201cThe first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,\u201d Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation. The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia\u2019s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice. One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice. Images of ice \u2014 transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network \u2014 would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon. For NASA\u2019s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable. Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund \u2014 especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated. \u201cBeing able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis \u2014 as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,\u201d said Engelund. \u201cEventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.\u201d It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth\u2019s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing \ufeffspace colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth. NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy. Bell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the \u201cframework for the lunar economy.\u201d \u201cA future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,\u201d Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN. \u201cThis includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.\u201d There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too. If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth \u2014 such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms. \u201cEspecially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,\u201d Klein said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/tech/nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_media_cnn-mark-thompson-layoffs-overhaul", "text": "Mark Thompson, the CNN chief executive appointed last year to modernize the news network, unveiled a set of sweeping changes to the iconic outlet Wednesday, announcing plans to build a billion-dollar digital business, experiment with artificial intelligence and overhaul key newsroom structures. The far-reaching measures, which Thompson described to staffers in a memo as a \u201ckey milestone in the transformation of CNN,\u201d will result in about 100 employees, or about three percent of the workforce, being laid off. Those employees, Thompson said, will be eligible for severance packages. Since his appointment last year, Thompson has been candid about the challenges facing CNN, stressing to staffers that swift and dramatic steps are necessary to reorient the television-focused news organization for a digital future. Like other legacy media companies, CNN has for its four-decade history relied heavily on carriage fees from the traditional cable news bundle, a declining business that has been upended by the advent of streaming services such as Netflix. While the company is still profitable to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars each year, pivoting the network\u2019s business away from the contracting cable industry, which provides the bulk of CNN\u2019s revenue, to position it for the future will be an enormously difficult challenge. \u201cTurning a great news organization towards the future is not a one-day affair. It happens in stages and over time,\u201d Thompson said in his memo to staff. \u201cToday\u2019s announcements do not answer every question or seek to solve every challenge we face. However, they\u00a0do\u00a0represent a significant step forward and I hope you will read about them in that spirit.\u201d Thompson\u2019s announcement that he intends to build a digital subscription business generating more than a billion dollars in revenue represents a cornerstone of his strategy to \u201cfuture-proof\u201d CNN. A direct-to-consumer subscription product has long been seen by CNN\u2019s leaders as the answer to shrinking revenues brought on by the decline of linear television. Former management launched CNN+, a subscription streaming service that was quickly shuttered when CNN\u2019s one-time parent company, WarnerMedia, merged with Discovery to form Warner Bros. Discovery. The siloed news streaming service did not fit into Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s business strategy, which called for building a super-streamer resembling the cable news bundle. CNN now boasts a much more budget-friendly streaming service, CNN Max, that lives alongside other brands like HBO inside its parent company\u2019s streaming service Max. Thompson, who was light on specifics while announcing his plans for a digital subscription business, said CNN will create \u201cproducts that will provide need-to-know news, analysis and context in compelling new formats and experiences.\u201d He said the first product will launch by the end of 2024. Thompson, who previously served as chief executive of The New York Times, had pushed to expand the newspaper\u2019s products beyond core news, acquiring review website The Wirecutter and launching the outlet\u2019s cooking vertical, among other moves. \u201cWe want to build on CNN.com\u2019s reach with a new focus on engagement and frequency \u2013 how long our users spend with us and how often they return \u2013 by improving the quality of the product experience and giving users powerful reasons to come back to us more often,\u201d Thompson said in his memo. As he works to modernize CNN\u2019s business, Thompson unveiled plans to embrace artificial intelligence tools, aiming to \u201creclaim the \u2018pioneering spirit\u2019 Ted Turner talked about at our founding and regain a leadership position in the news experiences of the future.\u201d Thompson said CNN will make a \u201cstrategic push\u201d into AI to \u201cdetermine how best to safely harness this emerging new technology to serve our audiences and deliver our journalistic goals more effectively and responsively.\u201d His transformative measures will also include a dramatic overhaul of CNN\u2019s newsroom, which has been largely split into three divisions: US television, international television and digital. Thompson said the structural changes he is implementing will unify the three branches under one roof. CNN will also further embrace a \u201cfollow the sun\u201d model, in which news stories are overseen at any given time by the company\u2019s bureaus across the world. As part of that effort, Thompson said CNN\u2019s Hong Kong bureau will see an \u201cexpanded role\u201d and that the organization would \u201cmake greater use\u201d of its bureaus in London and Los Angeles. \u201cThis will streamline workflows across newsgathering and place editorial direction closer to the story,\u201d Thompson explained. \u201cIt will better equip us to handle a wider array of platform needs around the clock and will mean we can flex news desk resources when the news cycle takes an unexpected turn.\u201d While Thompson primarily focused on digital offerings, he also announced plans to breathe new life into CNN\u2019s television programming. Thompson said that Charlie Moore, the longtime \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u201d executive producer who was recently promoted to vice president of prime time programming, will \u201cfind ways to further develop and strengthen\u201d the network\u2019s television offerings. Thompson further announced the creation of a \u201cTV Futures Lab\u201d that will \u201cnot only develop and manage streaming and (video on demand) programming for the Max platform but will lead new thinking about ways to migrate the linear news experience to other new digital environments.\u201d The changes come after years of strategy shifts and cuts at the pioneering cable news network. After longtime leader Jeff Zucker abruptly left the company in early 2022, the company has been without clear direction. Warner Bros. Discovery then appointed veteran television producer Chris Licht to replace Zucker. Licht was forced to lay off hundreds of staffers early in the job and never articulated a clear path for CNN to move into the digital future. Compounding his lack of vision, Licht\u2019s brief one-year tenure was marked by a series of severe missteps. Thompson, who is widely credited for revitalizing The Times, was appointed CNN chief executive last summer, after Licht\u2019s tumultuous run in the job. Since then, Thompson has spoken consistently about the need to transform CNN\u2019s business but has largely avoided offering specifics. Thompson\u2019s announcement Wednesday indicates he is now ready to execute on a more concrete plan. Whether Thompson can successfully create a billion-dollar digital news business at CNN remains to be seen. Time is also of the essence for Thompson as the cable news business continues to collapse. At The Times, the newspaper announced earlier this year that its digital subscription business will earn more than $1 billion in annual revenue, more than a decade after Thompson had initially taken the helm and started to implement changes there.

{"id": "2024_07_02_media_biden-mental-fitness", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s White House repeatedly and aggressively shot down reports\u00a0on\u00a0the president\u2019s age and any possible limitations\u00a0on his ability to perform all the duties of his office. But after his shaky debate performance last week, in which Biden routinely struggled to\u00a0get his point across, some in the White House press corps say they wish they had pushed harder to tell the story. In June, when the Wall Street Journal published a\u00a0lengthy piece\u00a0on President Joe Biden\u2019s mental\u00a0state, the newspaper\u00a0got\u00a0slammed.\u00a0The White House, its allies, and\u00a0some in the media\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources\u00a0\u2013\u00a0criticized the Journal for quoting mostly Republican political foes on the record, who had a clear political motive to damage Biden\u2019s image. No Democrats were quoted on the record making those allegations, and several Democrats complained their on-the-record quotes praising Biden\u2019s sharpness were not included. The\u00a0Journal defended its reporting at the time. Last week\u2019s debate on CNN laid bare many of the concerns the Journal\u2019s reporting had raised \u2013 that the president has good days and bad days but can sometimes seem to slip up. A New York Times report on Tuesday raised similar concerns by those who have recently been in the room with Biden. The Times reported Biden has more frequent \u201clapses,\u201d although at other times he appears sharp. After Biden\u2019s lackluster performance last week, some are questioning whether the White House press corps dropped the ball on fully covering Biden\u2019s limitations. Biden\u2019s\u00a0age issue is not secret or new. Nearly every media outlet has reported on\u00a0growing concerns about\u00a0Biden\u2019s age well before the debate. The White House in the past has complained that the coverage is disproportionate, and that the media is spending more time covering Biden\u2019s age than his accomplishments as president versus former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies. The media has faced accusations that it has not covered Biden\u2019s mental fitness more aggressively because it wants to prop up the campaign in some way \u2013 an accusation the White House reporters CNN spoke to denied. Several White House reporters\u00a0told CNN that\u00a0the\u00a0coverage\u00a0of Biden\u2019s age and his mental stamina\u00a0should have\u00a0pushed harder. They cited several difficulties in doing so before the debate \u2013 from the obvious political motivations of sources who either want to protect Biden\u2019s image or project a certain image, to the blowback from pursuing such reports, especially from the White House and Democrats. A difficult task Like all past presidents, Biden has good days and bad days. It\u00a0can be tricky to report on something as difficult to define as a person aging, when his opponent\u00a0is a convicted felon, who regularly lies and has threatened to use the government to go after his political opponents. Still, some reporters said the press corps\u00a0could\u00a0have done a better job\u00a0covering\u00a0Biden\u2019s physical and mental state. The failure of the media, one White House reporter said,\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0pushing more aggressively\u00a0into Biden\u2019s abilities after the release of the Robert Hurr report in February, which called Biden a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d Biden\u2019s age was also a right-wing talking point for years, something the White House was quick to point out to reporters,\u00a0which\u00a0may have inadvertently turned off any serious investigation. For example, deceptively edited clips of Biden from the G7 spread widely by right-wing media figures were made to seem as though he was aimlessly \u201cwandering off\u201d from fellow world leaders when really, he was speaking to parachutists who had just landed during a demonstration. \u201cThe right-wing media was calling him senile from day one, and that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cThen whenever you report on the age you were in some ways solidifying, giving credence to some people that were actually of bad faith.\u201d All the White House reporters who spoke to CNN for this piece chose to speak anonymously so they could speak more freely about their relationship with the White House. Keeping the president at a distance Reporters said the White House has not made the press corps\u2019 job easy:\u00a0The White House has put up guardrails around Biden, they say, and\u00a0he does not engage in as many interviews or planned press conferences\u00a0as previous presidents. At those events,\u00a0the press might be able to gauge how he\u2019s doing on the spot, without prepared remarks. \u201cThey keep him at arm\u2019s length, and he rarely does extended interviews,\u201d the reporter said of the White House,\u00a0although he acknowledged Biden has started giving more interviews as of late. Biden has done fewer interviews and formal press conferences than his most recent predecessors, according to data compiled by\u00a0Martha Joynt Kumar,\u00a0professor emerita of political science at Towson University who chronicles the presidents\u2019 interactions with the press. But on quick and informal interactions with the press, like shouted questions on the way to his helicopter or plane, Biden\u00a0as of this week has had 588 interactions, Kumar reports, second only to Trump when compared to recent presidents. But those interactions are not the same as an extended press conference, reporters noted. On Tuesday, ABC News announced Biden would sit down with George Stephanopoulos for an interview, his first since the debate. The White House press shop has also been very \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cfairly successful\u201d in mitigating coverage of concerns over the president\u2019s age,\u00a0said\u00a0another White House reporter who works for a different publication. \u201c[B]erating reporters who bring them reporting about age concerns, bemoaning that it\u2019s all anyone writes about (clearly, it\u2019s not) and often attacking pieces after they run,\u201d the reporter told CNN. \u201cI think that\u2019s left some folks to conclude that these stories are too painful to report or that they should pick their spots more. It\u2019s clear the age stories that have angered the White House (and the liberal Twittersphere) the most.\u201d Alex Thompson, a White House reporter for Axios, said on CNN the day after the debate that \u201cthe White House\u2019s response every single time\u00a0it\u00a0has come up for three-and-a-half years has been to deflect, to gaslight, to not tell the truth \u2013 not just to reporters, not just to other Democrats, but even at times to themselves about the president\u2019s limitations at his age.\u201d Still, this White House\u2019s recent conduct with reporters pales in comparison to Trump\u2019s team, which has done everything from revoking press access to reporters they disagree with, to calling reporters the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d The White House declined to comment. Aging doesn\u2019t happen all at once Aging is also not a sudden moment.\u00a0That makes it trickier to report on. \u201cTo some extent, the decline has appeared to be gradual \u2014 hard to notice from day to day \u2014 and that\u2019s perhaps made it harder for reporters to determine when is the right moment to write something,\u201d one of the reporters said. Just a few days before the debate, Biden held a press conference at the G7 alongside Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelensky that passed off without anything of note in Biden\u2019s demeanor. But reporters pointed out (and have published stories noting) that the president has been using teleprompters at most big events, even fundraisers where in the past he might not have. He has also started to use the lower stairs to board Air Force One. Last year, The New York Times published a lengthy piece on the \u201ccomplicated reality of America\u2019s oldest president,\u201d which looked at some of those accommodations and concerns for his age, but also the moments where he showed stamina and vigor. Some reporters said that there has been a distinct change\u00a0within the last year, and that the press corps should have reported more aggressively on the accommodations made for the president. \u201cI think the press, most of the White House press, did suffer from a bit of lack of curiosity,\u201d one of the reporters said. Look who you\u2019re up against Biden\u2019s allies will often question coverage of the president\u2019s age, questioning why reporters focus on the president\u2019s age and mental lucidity and not on Trump\u2019s\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who, at 78,\u00a0was observed falling asleep during his hush money trial, has made his own major verbal flubs and bizarre statements, and regularly spouts complete falsehoods. \u201cIt makes sense to reflect on this now and ask whether we missed or, really, under-reported the story of Biden\u2019s age and decline. But it\u2019s complicated,\u201d one of the reporters said. \u201cThe fact that the political alternative to Biden is an authoritarian who sparked an insurrection and is a convicted felon does not mean that the press is failing American democracy to focus on Biden\u2019s obvious frailty.\u201d One of the reporters said the media can, and do, report on both. Biden\u2019s allies, however, say too much attention is placed on Biden\u2019s age and not on the threat Trump could pose to American democracy. But the reporters say they can, and should, do both. \u201cJust because you are reporting on Biden age, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not reporting on Trump\u2019s lies.\u00a0 I find that argument silly, and it seems one design towards like producing a certain outcome in the election, rather than like an honest reporting,\u201d one of the reporters said. The outlets that had received harsh blowback for their previous reports on Biden\u2019s lucidity now feel justified. A source familiar with the staff behind the Wall Street Journal\u2019s report said that when the piece first published, the reporters were approached by people with sympathy asking how they\u2019re doing \u201cas if something terrible had just happened,\u201d the source said. After the debate, the reporters started to get messages saying they were right.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/media/biden-mental-fitness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_economy_june-jobs-report-final", "text": "Welcome to the \u201csteady-as-she-goes\u201d US labor market: Halfway through 2024, job gains are cooling slightly but overall employment activity remains solidly stable. The US economy added 206,000 jobs in June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday, easing from a downwardly revised May tally of 215,000 jobs. The unemployment rate moved a little higher, up 0.1 percentage points to 4.1%, marking the first time since November 2021 that the jobless rate was above 4%. That\u2019s not too shabby at a time when interest rates are at a 23-year high and the Federal Reserve is looking for inflation and overall demand to cool before bringing down rates, said Gus Faucher, chief economist for the PNC Financial Services Group. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing job growth slow a bit; we\u2019ve seen the unemployment rate tick up a little bit; we\u2019ve seen wage growth slow a bit,\u201d Faucher told CNN in an interview. \u201cBut those are all good news from the Fed\u2019s perspective, should help reduce inflationary pressures coming from the labor market, and should support Fed rate cuts toward the end of this year.\u201d Economists were expecting employers to have added 190,000 jobs last month and for the unemployment rate to remain at 4%, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Here are some of key points from the latest employment snapshot: Government and health care again led the way June\u2019s job gains were more broadly based than they have been in the past few months, but the growth was largely concentrated in two sectors: government and health care. The largest chunk of job gains occurred in the public sector, which added a net 70,000 jobs, specifically local government excluding education (up 34,100). The health care industry added another 48,600 positions. \u201cThis\u00a0is another proof point for a steady-as-she-goes\u00a0labor market\u00a0where demand is shifting in some key sectors and employers and employees are staying put,\u201d Ger Doyle, ManpowerGroup\u2019s senior vice president, said in a statement issued Friday. Some of the largest job losses occurred in temporary help services, which were down 48,900 for the month, dragging down the professional and business services super sector, which lost 17,000. Manufacturing and retail also saw losses, of 8,000 and 8,500, respectively. The temporary help category is often closely watched by economists as it could serve as a forward-looking economic data point in an otherwise lagging indicator: If companies are growing, they\u2019ll often get temporary help until they can hire for a full-time position; but if times are tougher, the temp workers usually are the first to go. \u201cThe sharp decline in\u00a0temporary help may portend future weakness in the labor market this summer,\u201d Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, wrote in commentary issued Friday. Potential inflationary pressure slowed Wage growth cooled as anticipated, with average hourly earnings rising 0.3% for the month and slowing to 3.9% on an annual basis, its lowest rate in three years. Slowing wages help set the stage for the\u00a0Federal Reserve\u00a0to begin cutting interest\u00a0rates\u00a0\u2014 if it also ends up translating into slower\u00a0inflation. Strong wage growth can put upward pressure on prices, but\u00a0Fed\u00a0officials have said they focus primarily on\u00a0inflation\u00a0gauges to know if price hikes are under control or not. It\u2019s possible for workers to rake in robust wage gains if productivity is keeping up, but last year\u2019s productivity burst lost some steam in early 2024. The labor force participation rate inched up to 62.6% from 62.5% after retreating by 0.2 percentage points in May. Through the first half of the year, the US has added 1.3 million jobs at an average pace of 222,000 per month, BLS data shows. April and May\u2019s job gains were both revised lower by a combined 111,000 jobs to 108,000 for April (down 57,000) and 218,000 for May (down 54,000). Hiring activity is milder than this point last year \u2014 and job growth has retreated from the blockbuster pace of 2021 and 2022, during the pandemic recovery. However, the labor market remains historically strong. The US just notched its 42nd consecutive month of job growth, the fifth-longest employment expansion on record. Unemployment rate increased for the third month in a row Much of the recent employment expansion has been marked by historically low unemployment: 30 months\u2019 worth at or below 4%. However, that streak broke in June, when the jobless rate moved higher to 4.1%. It\u2019s the third month in a row that the unemployment rate increased. That\u2019s notable but not necessarily worrisome just yet, Faucher said. \u201cIf we look at the last Fed dot plot, the median unemployment rate is 4.2% for the long run; we\u2019re right around that,\u201d Faucher said, referencing the central bank\u2019s latest economic projections. \u201cSo, this means that we\u2019re at the Fed\u2019s definition of maximum employment; it means that wage pressures are less pronounced coming from the labor market; and it\u2019s a good, solid labor market that is consistent with low inflation and solid long-run economic growth.\u201d Still, Friday\u2019s report did appear to confirm what other recent employment data has been showing: Job opportunities have shrank (but still are well above pre-pandemic levels), and people are staying unemployed for longer. The median duration of unemployment jumped higher, to 9.8 weeks from 8.9 weeks in May and landed at a level not seen since January 2023, BLS data shows. But what happens if the unemployment rate keeps moving higher? \u201cNow, if we start to get closer to 4.5%, am I going to be a little more concerned? Yes. But I think we have the kind of labor market that we want to see over the longer run.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/economy/june-jobs-report-final/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

MOD Pizza wants to avoid the fate of other fast-casual restaurant chains, as the industry grapples with inflation-weary customers who are pulling back from purchases such as eating out. Red Lobster filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May, saying it had more than $1 billion in debt and less than $30 million in cash on hand. MOD, founded in 2008 in Seattle, advertises 40 toppings and eight sauces for its customizable pizzas. The company says there are more than 540 locations across the United States and Canada. In January, MOD announced a new CEO, Beth Scott. Scott Svenson, who founded MOD in 2008 with his wife, Ally, became executive chairperson. In a January statement, Svenson said he knew he \u201cwould eventually transition out of the daily operations of the business.\u201d A MOD spokesperson said on July 3 that the chain had closed 44 restaurants.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/business/mod-pizza-new-owner/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_business_airbnb-hidden-cameras-key-takeaways-invs", "text": "For years, Airbnb has known some of its hosts have used hidden cameras to secretly spy on guests, invading their most private and intimate moments. While Airbnb has repeatedly acknowledged the problem in financial filings, it has worked to keep the scope of the issue out of the public eye through arbitration, confidential settlements and employee non-disclosure agreements. The company has also fought against regulations that could protect users and would provide authorities with more insight into who is using the platform. CNN reviewed more than 2,000 pages of lawsuits and police records to understand more about the short-term rental industry\u2019s hidden camera problem. CNN also spoke with nearly two dozen guests who found surveillance devices at vacation rentals or were told by police they were secretly recorded. A CNN investigation found the use of hidden cameras is a persistent problem in the industry. Regulations are sparse, and the punishments for those that commit these crimes are lenient \u2013 video voyeurism is typically charged as a misdemeanor. Meanwhile, the people who are recorded \u2013 often naked or engaging in sexual activities \u2013 say they suffer from long-term trauma and the fear that their images could, at any moment, be disseminated on the internet. An Airbnb spokesperson told CNN that hidden camera complaints are rare, but when they do occur, \u201cwe take appropriate, swift action, which can include removing hosts and listings that violate the policy.\u201d Airbnb has generated tens of thousands of customer support tickets related to surveillance devices over the last decade At a court-ordered deposition last year, an Airbnb representative was supposed to answer a key question from the attorney suing the company: How many complaints or reports had been made to Airbnb since December 1, 2013, of people who had been recorded by surveillance devices? The Airbnb representative testified that the company generated 35,000 customer support tickets about surveillance devices in the preceding decade. An Airbnb spokesperson told CNN that a single report could create multiple tickets. The company declined to specify how many unique complaints there have been. In the deposition, which has not been previously reported, the company representative sought to downplay the significance of the number of tickets, testifying they could reflect instances such as a malfunctioning doorbell camera or a tablet with recording capabilities left out on a coffee table. The representative did not provide any statistics detailing the number of claims she suggested were innocuous among the 35,000 tickets. One former employee who handled safety issues and security concerns for Airbnb\u2019s support line told CNN: \u201cI\u2019ve never received a call about a doorbell.\u201d The company doesn\u2019t have a policy instructing employees to contact law enforcement about hidden cameras Airbnb, as a matter of practice, does not notify law enforcement when they learn a host is \u201cfound to be in violation of the security camera and recording device policy,\u201d not even when a child is involved, the company representative testified. The company may, however, reach out to hosts about complaints as part of internal inquiries \u2013 a move law enforcement experts say could hinder criminal investigations because it gives suspects time to destroy evidence. Airbnb makes \u201cevery effort\u201d to support police investigations of hidden cameras, the company told CNN in a written statement. Airbnb has fought regulation efforts that could protect users Earlier this year, lawmakers in the European Union agreed to groundbreaking regulations governing the short-term rental industry. The new rules will require host registration, data sharing by the company and quality control of listings. Airbnb hailed the regulations as a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for the industry and praised the EU-wide approach. Its public praise belies the fact that Airbnb has fought European cities for attempting to regulate the industry, said Kim van Sparrentak, a member of the European Parliament, who steered the legislation through the governing body. \u201cAirbnb is similar to other sharing economy companies \u2013 on a municipal level that means filing lawsuits as soon as any regulation is proposed,\u201d she said, referring to the company\u2019s strategy of challenging regulations in court. There are no similar federal regulations in the United States. Airbnb has fought local regulations \u2013 many of which aim to tamp down on illegal listings or require data sharing with authorities \u2013 that would provide the government with more oversight. Airbnb does not perform background checks on all users. And even when it does, it tells customers not to rely on those checks Airbnb does not run background checks on all users, according to its website. The company says it may run a background check on a US-based user if it has at least a first name, last name and date of birth for a person who creates a listing. But the company\u2019s website tells users they should not rely on its background checks to identify \u201call past criminal convictions or sex offender registrations \u2026 or other red flags.\u201d And even if Airbnb discovers a user has a criminal background, convictions of \u201cmurder, terrorism, rape or child molestation\u201d are not automatic disqualifiers under the company\u2019s policy. Meanwhile, user verification is meant to ensure the accuracy of a listing and match a user\u2019s name with a government-issued ID. Airbnb says every host, co-host and booking guest is identity-verified. But the company concedes that its identity verification badge does not \u201cguarantee that someone is who they claim to be,\u201d according to its website. In a statement, an Airbnb spokesperson told CNN, \u201cAirbnb\u2019s trust and safety policies lead the vacation rental industry and include background checks on US-based hosts and guests.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/business/airbnb-hidden-cameras-key-takeaways-invs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson in San Francisco ruled on Tuesday that the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act governing benefit plans did not cover the former employees\u2019 claims, and therefore she lacked jurisdiction. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. Musk\u2019s lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests. The case is one of many accusing Musk of reneging on promises to former Twitter employees, including\u00a0former Chief Executive Parag Agrawal, and vendors after buying the company for $44 billion in October 2022. Musk also runs the electric car company Tesla, and is the world\u2019s richest person, according to Forbes magazine. According to the\u00a0complaint, Twitter\u2019s 2019 severance plan called for employees who stayed on after the buyout to receive two or six months of pay, plus one week of pay for each year of employment, if they were laid off. The plaintiffs Courtney McMillian, who oversaw Twitter\u2019s compensation and benefits, and Ronald Cooper, an operations manager, said Twitter instead offered fired employees just one month of pay as severance, with no benefits. Thompson said ERISA didn\u2019t apply to Twitter\u2019s post-buyout plan because there was no \u201congoing administrative scheme\u201d where the company reviewed claims case-by-case, or offered benefits such as continued health insurance and out placement services. \u201cThere were only cash payments promised,\u201d she wrote.

In the lawsuit, filed Sunday in New York state court, the president\u2019s sonaccuses Fox News of unjust enrichment, intentionally inflicting emotional distress, and violating New York civil rights laws. The lawsuit makes good on\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s threat he made in April that he would take the network to court if it didn\u2019t immediately issue retractions and corrections. The miniseries, \u201cThe Trial of Hunter Biden,\u201d was a six-part offering on the Fox Nation digital streaming network, and was also promoted on Fox News, the cable TV channel. It featured a dramatized \u201cmock trial\u201d about Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas financial dealings that led in part to his federal tax indictment and that also fueled House Republicans\u2019 struggling impeachment inquiry into his father. Fox News\u00a0took down the miniseries\u00a0in late April, one day after Hunter Biden threatened to file a lawsuit. But according to the lawsuit, promotional materials for the miniseries are still on some Fox News-linked social media pages, and the miniseries episodes are still circulating \u201conline and in the public domain.\u201d A Fox News spokesperson claimed the lawsuit was meritless and \u201centirely politically motivated,\u201d and said the network looks forward to \u201cvindicating our rights in court.\u201d \u201cThe core complaint stems from a 2022 streaming program that Mr. Biden did not complain about until sending a letter in late April 2024,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe program was removed within days of the letter, in an abundance of caution, but Hunter Biden is a public figure who has been the subject of multiple investigations and is now a convicted felon. Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden\u2019s own making.\u201d The new lawsuit claims Fox News \u201ctargeted Mr. (Hunter) Biden in an effort to harass, annoy, alarm, and humiliate him, and tarnish his reputation.\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s son is seeking an unspecified amount of punitive damages, as well as any profits that Fox reaped from the miniseries, and other corrective measures. \u201cThe miniseries is fictionalized; it is not a news event. It was made for the purpose of trade and advertising, and merely exploits Mr. Biden\u2019s name, image, and likeness for Fox\u2019s commercial benefit,\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers wrote in the lawsuit. Hunter Biden\u2019s team said in the lawsuit that without his consent, Fox News \u201cunlawfully published numerous intimate images (both still and video) of Mr. Biden depicting him in the nude, depicting an unclothed or exposed intimate part of him, as well as engaged in sex acts.\u201d The right-wing network said these images originated form Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0infamous laptop\u00a0\u2013 data from which was leaked by allies for former President Donald Trump in 2020. The president\u2019s son was\u00a0convicted at a trial\u00a0last month on federal gun charges, and faces a second trial this fall on alleged tax crimes.

Saks owner HBC announced a deal Thursday to acquire Neiman Marcus for $2.65 billion, establishing a luxury behemoth called Saks Global that has the two namesake department stores plus Saks Off 5th discount store and the upscale Bergdorf Goodman. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to take this step in bringing together these iconic luxury names, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman,\u201d said HBC CEO Richard Baker in a release. The two companies have been linked to merger talks for years, and the deal gives them more leverage to negotiate with luxury brands for lower costs. Saks has 39 stores, while Neiman Marcus, which filed for bankruptcy in 2020, has 36 stores. Neiman Marcus also owns Bergdorf Goodman. Several leadership changes were also announced. Current Saks.com CEO Marc Metrick will become the CEO for the Saks Global business. Current HBC Properties and Investments CEO Ian Putnam will become CEO of Saks Global\u2019s property and investments business. Both of them will report to Baker, who becomes the executive chairman of Saks Global. The merger means that HBC\u2019s Canadian business, which includes Hudson\u2019s Bay department stores and $2 billion in property across the country, will operate separately from Saks Global. The unit \u201cwill be well positioned to support future growth, while continuing to serve its loyal Canadian base,\u201d the release said. The chains are responding to industry shifts, including the decline of department stores, and the growing power of luxury brands. Brands such as Louis Vuitton parent LVMH are getting bigger and shifting their distribution strategy to direct-to-consumer sales, away from department stores. The planned Saks-Neiman Marcus merger seeks to wrest back some control. It also comes on the heels of Coach parent Tapestry\u2019s proposal to buy Michael Kors owner Capri. \u201cAs a larger entity, negotiating power will be a little better with the brands, but even a combined chain would not match the heft and power of the global luxury conglomerates, which would still hold most of the card,\u201d Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients Wednesday. Saks\u2019 deal could face regulatory scrutiny, however. The Federal Trade Commission sued to block Tapestry\u2019s merger with Capri, saying it would harm competition. \u201cThe proposed merger threatens to deprive millions of American consumers of the benefits of Tapestry and\u00a0Capri\u2019s head-to-head competition, which includes competition on price, discounts and promotions, innovation, design,\u00a0marketing and advertising,\u201d the FTC said. Amazon also is investing in the merger, working with Saks Global to \u201cinnovate on behalf of customers and brands partners following the close of the transaction,\u201d the release said. Amazon has tried to grow in physical retail. In 2022, it opened Amazon Style clothing stores in Glendale, California, and Columbus, Ohio, but closed them last year. Saunders added that Amazon\u2019s stake does \u201cmake sense, as it has ambitions to play more heavily in the luxury space and this would give it a toehold.\u201d \u201cHowever, the real win here would be the ability of Amazon to streamline logistics and e-commerce, giving the new entity an advantage in a market where remote shopping has become more important to shoppers \u2014 especially younger ones, which both chains need to do more to attract,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/business/saks-fifth-avenue-neiman-marcus-amazon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_success_gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy", "text": "Employees\u2019 negative daily emotions and lack of well-being can ultimately hurt worker engagement \u2013 and the economy, according to a new report released this week. Gallup, in its \u201cState of the Global Workplace,\u201d estimates that low employee engagement costs the global economy $8.9 trillion, or 9% of global GDP. The report includes findings from its latest annual World Poll, which surveyed 128,278 employees in more than 140 countries last year. That poll found that roughly 20% of workers globally reported feeling lonely, angry or sad on a daily basis. And 41% on average say they feel stress. Those most likely to say they feel lonely were younger workers (22%), employees who worked remotely full-time (25%) and those who felt most disengaged on the job (31%). While work isn\u2019t always the cause of a person\u2019s negative daily emotions, employers should still be concerned. That\u2019s because work can either improve or worsen employees\u2019 well-being. On the one hand,\u00a0the Gallup report noted,\u00a0\u201cwhen employees find their work and work relationships meaningful, employment is associated with high levels of daily enjoyment and low levels of all negative daily emotions. Notably, half of employees who are engaged at work are thriving in life overall.\u201d On the other, researchers found that being disengaged at work can negatively affect a person\u2019s wellbeing as much as \u2014 or more than \u2014 not having a job at all. \u201cEmployees who dislike their jobs tend to have high levels of daily stress and worry, as well as elevated levels of all other negative emotions,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOn many wellbeing items (stress, anger, worry, loneliness), being actively disengaged at work is equivalent to or worse than being unemployed.\u201d Engaged managers help workers thrive The poll found that last year only 23% of employees were engaged at work, unchanged from the year prior. Gallup defines an engaged employee as someone \u201chighly involved in and enthusiastic about their work and workplace. They are psychological \u2018owners,\u2019 drive performance and innovation, and move the organization forward.\u201d But those who said they were not engaged rose by 3 percentage points to 62%. These are employees characterized as \u201cpsychologically unattached to their work and company. Because their engagement needs are not being fully met, they are putting time but not energy or passion into their work.\u201d Engagement levels are highest in so-called \u201cbest practice\u201d organizations, where three-fourths of managers on average are engaged as well as seven in 10 non-managers, Gallup said. Their best practices include leaders\u2019 emphasizing well-being at work and in life; and putting a high priority on manager hiring and development. The manager piece of the equation is especially crucial. \u201c[W]hen managers are engaged, employees are more likely to be engaged,\u201d the report said. And, it added, \u201chigh-engagement business units are likely to see significantly higher employee wellbeing \u2014 as well as higher productivity, profitability and sales \u2014 than low-engagement teams.\u201d Where the most and least stressed workers are Engagement and well-being results varied in each of the 10 regions covered by Gallup\u2019s poll. The report noted that the United States and Canada, for example, showed the highest percentage of engaged employees (33%) among all the regions studied; and the third highest percentage of thriving employees (53%), behind Australia and New Zealand (60%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (54%). But the US and Canada also ranked second among employees experiencing daily stress (49%), right behind the Middle East and North Africa (52%). By contrast, Europe showed the lowest level of employee engagement (13%). South Asia scored lowest in terms of employees described as thriving overall (13%).

In his first network TV interview, Merle Meyers, a 30-year veteran of Boeing, described to CNN what he says was an elaborate off-the-books practice that Boeing managers at the Everett factory used to meet production deadlines, including taking\u00a0damaged and improper parts from the company\u2019s scrapyard, storehouses and loading docks. A string of whistleblowers this year has raised allegations about Boeing factory lapses, including an official federal complaint\u00a0from a current employee\u00a0that Boeing hid potentially defective parts from Federal Aviation Administration inspectors, and that some of those parts likely ended up in planes. This all comes in the wake of a series of highly public safety issues that have rocked the company. Meyers\u2019 claims that lapses he witnessed\u00a0were intentional, organized efforts designed to thwart quality control processes in an effort to keep\u00a0up with demanding production schedules. Beginning in the early 2000s, Meyers says that for more than a decade, he estimates that about 50,000 parts \u201cescaped\u201d quality control\u00a0and were used to build aircraft. Those parts include everything from small items like screws to more complex assemblies like wing flaps. A single Boeing 787 Dreamliner, for example, has approximately 2.3 million parts. Most of the parts that were meant to be scrapped were often painted red to signify they were unsuitable for assembly lines, Meyers said. Yet, in some cases, that didn\u2019t stop them\u00a0 from being put into planes being assembled, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem,\u201d Meyers told CNN. \u201cA core requirement of a quality system is to keep bad parts and good parts apart.\u201d Airplanes are highly specified machines with much stricter safety standards than trains and cars. Their parts, materials and manufacturing processes are highly regulated. Meyers, whose job was to find quality problems at Boeing, says he believes he was forced out last year and says he was given a severance package that he is unable to discuss due to a privacy agreement he signed with Boeing. Based on conversations Meyers says he had with current Boeing workers in the time since he left the company, he believes that while employees no longer remove parts from the scrapyard, the practice of using other unapproved\u00a0parts in assembly lines continues. \u201cNow they\u2019re back to taking parts of body sections \u2013 everything \u2013 right when it arrives at the Everett site, bypassing quality, going right to the airplane,\u201d Meyers said. Company emails going back years show that Meyers repeatedly flagged the issue to Boeing\u2019s corporate investigations team, pointing out what he says were blatant violations of Boeing\u2019s safety rules. But investigators\u00a0routinely failed to enforce those rules, Meyers says, even ignoring \u201ceye witness observations\u00a0and the hard work done to ensure the safety of future passengers and crew,\u201d he wrote in an internal 2022 email provided to CNN. Meyers has also described his concerns about Boeing\u2019s quality issues to federal investigators, a Senate panel and the New York Times. In a statement to CNN, Boeing did not dispute Meyers\u2019 allegations. The company said it investigates \u201call allegations of improper behavior, such as unauthorized movement of parts or mishandling of documents,\u201d and makes improvements when appropriate. Swirl of controversy Meyers\u2019 allegations come as Boeing faces a swirl of controversy over its safety culture, including a criminal investigation into whether it misled the FAA over its 2017 certification of the 737 Max. A total of 346 people were killed in two 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019. As CNN reported over the weekend, the Justice Department is nearing an agreement with Boeing which would resolve potential criminal liability. In January, a door plug blew off of a 737 Max mid-flight, prompting a wave of intense scrutiny of the airplane manufacturer, including federal and congressional investigations. Boeing\u2019s CEO Dave Calhoun has announced he will step down by the end of this year. To address its safety issues, Boeing recently agreed to purchase supplier Spirit AeroSystems. Since January a number of whistleblowers have come forward with fresh allegations against Boeing. A current Boeing quality investigator, Sam Mohawk, also filed an official complaint last month reporting \u201ca number of non-compliant parts making their way back to the airplanes for installation.\u201d His complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration was publicly released by a Senate subcommittee investigating Boeing. Mohawk\u2019s complaint said the issue of disappearing nonconforming parts continues.\u00a0\u201cBoeing is still losing parts to this day,\u201d his official complaint reads. A separate whistleblower, Richard Cuevas, last week made public his concerns that Boeing and its key supplier Spirit Aerosystems used compromised parts and made changes to \u201creduce bottlenecks in production and speed up production and delivery.\u201d Pulled from the scrapyard The pressure from Boeing management to keep assembly lines moving is no secret.\u00a0The 245-page House investigative report after the 737 Max fatal crashes dedicates an entire chapter to \u201cProduction Pressure.\u201d\u00a0After the January 5 door plug blowout on a 737 Max, the FAA capped\u00a0Boeing\u2019s production line speed. Meyers describes a pressure-packed environment at the Everett factory, where assembly teams competed with each other to find the parts they needed. Meyers alleges that after hours, workers would ask security guards to unlock doors and sneak parts out of supply rooms, or remove newly arrived components awaiting quality inspections by Meyers\u2019 team.\u00a0Similar parts destined for a different airplane model were ripe for the taking. At some point in the early 2000s, Boeing employees began also pulling parts from the company\u2019s scrapyard in Auburn, Washington, located about an hour south\u00a0of the nearly 100-acre factory building\u00a0where Dreamliners were assembled,\u00a0according to documentation\u00a0Meyers shared with CNN. Nonconforming parts end up in the reclamation yard, Meyers says, only after being\u00a0rejected by three departments:\u00a0Engineering, procurement, and quality. Meyers claims that by around 2002, employees at the reclamation yard became concerned that they would be considered responsible when scrap parts were later found on an aircraft.\u00a0So, they asked employees to sign for the removals \u2013 but their homemade form wasn\u2019t an official Boeing document, which meant the removal was never recorded in the company\u2019s quality management database. \u201cThese are bootleg forms that are not Boeing authorized,\u201d Meyers said.\u00a0\u201cThe procurement organization would go down to our scrap reclamation yard and intimidate the employees there and say we need these parts bad.\u201d Lack of enforcement Meyers says he repeatedly referred violations for investigation but found the company\u2019s efforts to look into them lacking. \u201cTheir investigations are about analyzing excuses by process violators, and not taking action against those committing compliance violations,\u201d Meyers wrote in a 2002 email to corporate HR at Boeing\u00a0. In its statement, Boeing said the quality team Meyers worked on \u201cplays an important role in identifying issues, improving processes, and strengthening compliance in our factories.\u201d \u201cWe appreciate employees who raise their voice and we have systems in place to encourage them to speak up confidentially or anonymously,\u201d the statement said. Meyers says his Boeing managers did not know how to handle employees who raised concerns, and said that after decades at the company he was ultimately given\u00a0a list of management grievances with his work, and offered a vague opportunity to improve \u2013 or take a cash payout and leave. \u201cI was given a list of things to correct \u2013 it was my behaviors and my practices as a manager,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cSo it looked like a personal improvement program \u2026 but it had a financial incentive with it \u2013 or you can take this money and quit.\u201d Meyers said he never intended to become a whistleblower but is now speaking with those who ask \u2013 including a Senate subcommittee probing Boeing \u2013 to generate momentum for change. \u201cHopefully we can get this company to heal and be what it was,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_07_09_business_fed-chair-powell-talks-up-progress-on-inflation-but-says-rate-cuts-not-imminent-yet", "text": "Inflation has come a long way since reaching a four-decade peak two years ago, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday. However, central bank officials still want to see more progress before cutting interest rates, he noted, though they are also keeping a close eye on the job market. \u201cWe do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,\u201d Powell said in prepared testimony submitted to congressional lawmakers. During the hearing, Powell didn\u2019t specify that cutting this year remains likely, or give any hint about the timing of the first rate cut, which is a departure from previous comments he\u2019s made. \u201cThe most recent inflation readings, however, have shown some modest further progress, and more good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%,\u201d he added. Powell appeared Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee to deliver his semiannual monetary policy report to Congress. He heads to the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday to address the same report on the state of the US economy. The Fed\u2019s key interest rate, which influences borrowing costs across the economy, has been at a 23-year high for about a year now, after the central bank aggressively lifted rates to bring down inflation. While the pace of price hikes slowed dramatically in 2023, it hit a snag early this year, which pushed back the timing of the first anticipated rate cut. Fed officials expect to cut interest rates just once this year, according to their latest economic projections in June, compared to the three cuts they forecast in March. Inflation resumed a downward trend in the spring, but officials appear to be in lockstep saying they need more evidence that inflation is truly headed toward their 2% goal. In June, consumer prices didn\u2019t rise on a monthly basis for the first time since November, according to the Fed\u2019s favorite inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index. The annual PCE inflation rate registered at 2.6% in June, down slightly from 2.7% in May. \u201cInflation is now around 2-and-a-half percent, so we have seen significant progress in bringing it down,\u201d New York Fed President John Williams said last week at an event in India. \u201cBut we still have a way to go to reach our 2% target on a sustained basis.\u201d But inflation isn\u2019t the only thing the Fed is watching as it mulls when to begin cutting interest rates. The Fed is watching America\u2019s long-robust job market closely after it has shown signs of cooling. That comes as US consumers show signs of pulling back after years of elevated inflation and a sharp rise in interest rates, according to the latest spending data and remarks from retailers. Here are key takeaways from Powell\u2019s hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. Powell says the labor market is back to normal \u2014 but there are still risks The Fed\u2019s top leader told senators that America\u2019s job market now looks similar to the way it did before the Covid-19 pandemic: \u201cstrong, but not overheated.\u201d The US job market rebounded mightily after a brief, pandemic-induced recession in 2020, and it has continued to expand ever since. But it has loosened a little recently: The unemployment rate last month crept up to its highest level in more than two years, and new applications for unemployment benefits have trended up in recent weeks. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that if the Fed waits too long to lower rates, the Fed could undo the progress we\u2019ve made in creating good-paying jobs,\u201d\u00a0Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, said during the hearing. The US job market is still a pillar of strength for the broader economy but it\u2019s not running at the same red-hot pace of a few years ago. The unemployment rate edged higher, to 4.1%, in June, the highest rate since November 2021, though employers have continued to hire at a brisk pace. The gap between job openings and the number of unemployed people seeking work, a measure of how tight the labor market is, has narrowed markedly over the past year. Powell expressed throughout the hearing that the Fed is fully aware that it is dealing with \u201ctwo-sided risks\u201d \u2014 one is of inflation heating back up because the central bank cut rates too soon, and the other is of the labor market weakening sharply because the Fed waited too long to cut rates. Both risks would result in consequences for Americans and the overall US economy. The Fed is tasked by Congress to both stabilize prices and maximize employment, and it balances its focus on either goal depending on the economic circumstances at the time. For a few years, the Fed has focused more on its inflation side of its dual mandate, but that has shifted recently. \u201cIf we see that the labor market were weakening unexpectedly, which is to say more than what we\u2019ve seen in a material way unexpectedly,\u201d Powell said, \u201cthen we could also respond to that, because we have a dual mandate and we now see the two mandates more in balance than they were a year ago.\u201d America\u2019s economic engine, consumer spending, has started to show some cracks. Sales at US retailers have consistently come in weaker than expected for the past few months and retailers have sounded the alarm on shoppers across the income spectrum trading down for cheaper alternatives. Recent surveys of service-providing businesses in the United States have shown that consumer demand so far this summer has been tepid, a stark contrast to last year when Americans splurged. Put together, the recent spate of economic data help build a case for the Fed to begin lowering borrowing costs. Senators talk financial regulation The Fed chief told lawmakers that a proposed set of banking regulations will likely be revised and re-proposed \u2014 a topic Republicans repeatedly brought up with Powell. Meanwhile, some Democrats talked about rules over compensation for Wall Street executives. The Fed is one of the country\u2019s key banking regulators, in addition to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, banking authorities around the world convened in Basel, Switzerland, to develop global standards for banks to fortify financial stability. Those rules are still in the process of being adopted and implemented. The final phase of these banking rules is known as Basel III Endgame, and it calls on raising the amount of capital that the largest banks hold to protect themselves against risks. The Fed\u2019s latest so-called \u201cstress test,\u201d which is a simulation of how major banks would fare in tough economic conditions, showed that all 31 banks tested would survive and still be able to lend credit. But they took a bigger financial hit\u00a0than last year. When the Basel III Endgame was proposed last year, bank interest groups\u00a0and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle\u00a0pushed back, saying that banks needing to beef up capital\u00a0beyond what\u2019s currently required\u00a0would undermine their ability to lend. Powell said Tuesday a \u201cstrongly held view of the members of the board is that we do need to put a revised proposal out for comment for some period.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what changes a new proposal would specifically have. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts grilled Powell over a long-delayed rule that aims to restrain reckless behavior on Wall Street tied to incentive-based pay for executives, known as Section 956 of the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act passed in 2010. Several regulators, including the Fed, need to figure out how to implement the rule first, but reaching a consensus among them is typically a challenge, especially considering intense lobbying efforts. \u201cThe Fed has refused to join the other financial regulators in finalizing a rule implementing Section 956 as Congress directed,\u201d Warren said. She pointed to a comment that Powell made in the past that he wants to see evidence of the problem that Section 956 would solve. Powell said that he \u201cnever said trust the banks to regulate themselves.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/business/fed-chair-powell-talks-up-progress-on-inflation-but-says-rate-cuts-not-imminent-yet/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_04_23_cars_electric-vehicle-sales-forecast-iea", "text": "Global electric vehicle sales are set to rise by more than a fifth to reach 17 million this year, powered by drivers in China, according to the International Energy Agency. In a report Tuesday, the IEA projected that \u201csurging demand\u201d for EVs over the next decade was set \u201cto remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport.\u201d It expects half of all cars sold globally to be electric by 2035, up from more than one in five this year, provided charging infrastructure keeps pace. The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs. The agency\u2019s bullish long-term outlook for EVs \u2014 based on current government policies \u2014 comes just days after the world\u2019s biggest battery EV maker Tesla slashed its prices in major markets to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers. Recent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The data \u201cdoes not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars. It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday. The growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers. The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union rose almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. In a statement, Birol said: \u201cRather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.\u201d Despite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats. In the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the world\u2019s biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States. Earlier this month, Tesla posted its first annual drop in sales in nearly four years. The company\u2019s stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year. China\u2019s BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023. Automakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the \u201cpace of the transition to EVs\u2026 will hinge on affordability.\u201d In China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average. \u201cIntensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,\u201d the IEA said. \u201cGrowing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,\u201d it added. Last year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market. \u201cChina is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,\u201d Birol said. Concerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an investigation late last year into China\u2019s state support for EV makers. The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the region\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW. EV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country. By 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA. That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year. \u201cThis shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,\u201d Birol said. The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector. In addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States. Under current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA.

The company cited \u201cextremely low volumes\u201d of checks in a statement to CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly surprising Target has decided to stop accepting them,\u201d said Neil Saunders, retail analyst at GlobalData. \u201cThat said, there will be small pockets of people, including more elderly consumers, who will lament that they are being phased out.\u201d The company said its stores will continue to accept other payment methods, including Apple Pay, SNAP/EBT, buy now/pay later services, Target Circle Cards, its store card, plus cash, credit and debit cards. Around 61% of Americans are still writing checks, according to a 2024 report by Abrigo, a financial software solutions company. It also found that younger consumers, including Gen Z and Millennials, self reported writing more checks than older consumers from Gen X. Target is not the only store to wave farewell to checks. Grocery store Aldi, for instance, notes on its website that it does not accept checks. Amazon-owned Whole Foods also does not take checks as a form of payment. The decision to stop accepting personal checks comes as the latest move in a series of changes to the retailer\u2019s checkout experience. It announced earlier in March that it would limit the number of items accepted at self-checkout counters to 10 and allow store management to set hours of operation for self-checkout machines to try to combat rising retail theft. In the wake of declining sales reported earlier this year, Target also slashed prices on more than 5,000 items, including popular household staples, in an effort draw in inflation-wary customers.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/business/target-personal-checks/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_20_investing_microsoft-stock-record-high-altman-openai", "text": "Microsoft stock reached a record high on Monday after the company said that Sam Altman, former chief executive of OpenAI, will join the company to head its artificial intelligence innovation leg. Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing. Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive. Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year.

{"id": "2024_06_12_success_saving-under-high-interest-rates", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is an updated version of an article that originally ran on May 1. As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged for its seventh meeting in a row on Wednesday. People carrying variable-rate debt like credit cards and those seeking a loan won\u2019t be happy given that the Fed\u2019s rate, which directly and indirectly affects consumers\u2019 borrowing costs, remains at a 23-year high. Those rates will likely stay high for a while. At this point, only one cut is seen as likely before the end of the year, according to US central bankers\u2019 latest summary of economic projections. But whenever the cuts start, they may be small. \u201cAbsent a complete about-face from the economy, interest rates aren\u2019t likely to come down soon enough, or fast enough, to provide meaningful relief to borrowers. Utilize zero-percent credit card balance transfer offers, shop around for lower fixed-rate personal loans and home equity loans, and channel as much income as possible toward paying down this debt as quickly as possible,\u201d said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com\u2019s chief financial analyst. But the Fed\u2019s decision leaves savers, once again, in the catbird seat when it comes to making money on their money. \u201cSavers are enjoying the best returns on savings accounts and CDs in more than 15 years, with the most competitive offers outpacing inflation. In addition, these conditions are poised to persist for the foreseeable future,\u201d McBride said. Online high-yield savings accounts The best bang for your savings can still be had in online high-yield savings accounts at FDIC-insured banks, which yield way more than today\u2019s 0.58% overall average savings rate. As of June 11, the average online savings account rate was 4.40%, according to DepositAccounts.com. And many online high-yield accounts continue to offer rates of 5% or more. Say you have $10,000 in savings. If you leave it parked in a regular savings account at 0.5%, you\u2019ll get $50 in interest for a year. If you put it instead in a 5% high-yield account, you\u2019ll get $500. A high-yield savings account is the best place to park money you\u2019ll need to cover emergencies as well as anticipated large expenses that you have to pay in the next three months to a year. As with any savings account, banks can lower the rate they offer \u2014 also known as the APY \u2014 at any time. And you can be sure they will do just that when the Fed looks like it will finally start cutting rates, McBride said. But, he added, since rates are likely to be cut in small increments, online high-yield savings accounts may continue to offer inflation-beating returns for some time. \u201cThey will still offer the best way to preserve your [money\u2019s] buying power,\u201d McBride said. Money market accounts and money market funds Money market deposit accounts and money market mutual funds are generating yields competitive with the best high-yield savings accounts. But there are important differences. Money market deposit accounts are bank products. So, assuming your bank is FDIC insured, your account is too. (Or, if your account is at a federally backed credit union, your money will be\u00a0insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.) As with high-yield accounts, you may get the best deals at an online bank. But money market accounts may have a higher minimum deposit requirement than a high-yield account. Money market funds, by contrast, are an investment product \u2014 they generate return by investing in short-term, low-risk debt instruments and are currently yielding an average of 5.12%, according to the Crane 100 Money Fund Index. Such funds are a good place to park cash you have in your brokerage account that you may want to use at some point to buy equities or bonds, McBride said. Money market funds are not FDIC-insured, but any brokerage you use should be insured by the\u00a0Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which\u00a0covers your funds up to a limit if your brokerage ever goes under. Certificates of deposit CDs are still a great place to park any money you can leave untouched for a fixed\u00a0period of time \u2014 anywhere from a few months to five years or longer. As of June 11, the average rate was 4.971% on an online one-year CD, and 3.815% on a five-year CD, according to DepositAccounts.com. While your brick-and-mortar bank may offer a CD at a good rate, you may get a better one shopping around. The easiest way to do that without having to set up an additional account at another bank is to shop for CDs through your online brokerage, which is likely to offer a wide array of CDs from many different banks. At Schwab.com, for instance, CDs on offer ranging in duration from three months all the way up to 10 years offered average annual returns over 5%, with most ranging between 5.30% and 5.45%. The highest annual average was 5.56% for a three-month CD. If you have to withdraw money before the end of a CD\u2019s term, you can always get all of your principal back but may forfeit some of the interest earned as an early withdrawal penalty. Treasury bills and notes Beyond deposit accounts, investing in short-term Treasury bills and intermediate-term Treasury notes has been another way to earn a competitive return with virtually no risk since Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Treasury bills come in six different maturities: 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 13 weeks, 17 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks. Treasury notes mature in two, three, five, seven or 10 years. \u201cAs long as the Fed holds its rate in the 5.25% to 5.5% range, we expect most Treasury bill yields to hover around 5.25% as well,\u201d said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. But, Martin added, \u201cWhile the timing of rate cuts has been pushed back, we still expect them to arrive later this year, and investors in short-term investments would likely face reinvestment risk.\u201d That\u2019s why he suggests investors consider buying some intermediate-term investments now before rates are cut if they want to lock in a higher yield for some of their money, such as Treasury notes maturing in the next four to 10 years. On Wednesday, yields on Treasury bills were north of 5% and yields on Treasury notes were north of 4%, according to Schwab.com. When deciding whether it makes sense to invest in a CD or a Treasury for the same duration, you might opt for the Treasury if you live in a high-tax state, McBride suggested, since interest on Treasuries is\u00a0exempt from state and local taxes. In all instances, the easiest way to purchase Treasuries and other bonds is to do so through your brokerage account.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/success/saving-under-high-interest-rates/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_food_gen-z-drinking-trends-alcohol", "text": "Beer and hot dogs are as patriotic as it gets. But cracking open the cooler at your July 4th barbecue, you could be seeing fewer brews, with alternatives like spiked seltzers, canned cocktail and hard teas stealing their real estate. And you can blame the youngs for that: The youngest cohort of legal-aged drinkers from Gen Z, which encompass the ages from 21 to 26, are \u201cdrinking completely different than any other generation we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d according to NIQ\u2019s Kaleigh Theriault. \u201cThey\u2019re relatively new to their drinking and when they are choosing alcohol they are leaning toward those flavor-forward categories,\u201d Theriault, an associate director of beverage alcohol thought leadership at the consumer intelligence company, told CNN. Beverages created by smaller companies are controlling the landscape. E. & J. Gallo Winery\u2019s High Noon dominates the spirit-based cocktail category; White Claw from Mark Anthony Brands remains the top-selling spiked seltzer; and newer entrants, including punchier drinks that mix liquor with an iced tea or lemonade such as Surfside, a two-year-old brand, are rapidly gaining ground. That\u2019s a problem for Big Beer, which is dealing with flat sales, declining volume and a fickle generation of younger drinkers who are completely ditching the bottle or preferring anything but a regular beer. In response, Miller Lite-maker Molson Coors Beverage Company, Modelo-brewer Constellation Brands and heavyweight Anheuser-Busch InBev are among the larger brewers expanding beyond beer and diversifying their portfolio with flavorful concoctions. Fruit, in particular, has been a focus area because \u201cit\u2019s something that the consumer seems to be drawn to right now and they want to drink something really good,\u201d Theriault said. \u201cThose flavors offer that.\u201d Inspiration from TikTok Constellation turned to TikTok for inspiration for its newest beer, which is lightly based on the \u201cCorona Sunrise\u201d cocktail \u2014 a mixture of tequila, a Corona, orange juice, grenadine, plus a splash of lime juice. It has taken off on the video-sharing app, with the most-watched tutorial racking up nearly 14 million views. Since it\u2019s unlawful to sell a beer mixed with a spirit, Corona spun up its own version to hopefully appeal to younger drinkers: the \u201cSunbrew\u00a0Citrus Cerveza,\u201d which is brewed with orange and lime peels and blended with the same\u00a0juices and mixed with a Corona Extra to mirror the sweet flavor of the cocktail counterpart. \u201cThis new brew was created with the flavor-seeking Gen Z audience in mind, a group of drinkers known for their experimentation and mixing,\u201d noted Sa\u00fal Trejo, director of brand marketing at Corona, in a press release. For now, the drink is only available in the northeastern US before possibly expanding nationwide depending on sales. Sunbrew fits into Constellation\u2019s portfolio with a few other Gen Z-angled beverages like Fresca Mixed and its malt-based beverages, Corona Refresca and Modelo Spiked Aguas Frescas, both of which also have fruity flavors and are selling well for the company. TikTok has also influenced Molson Coors for one of its newest boozy beverages called \u201cHappy Thursday.\u201d The shtick? It\u2019s a non-carbonated drink because \u201cbloating that may come from carbonation is considered a top barrier\u201d for younger drinkers and the trend of \u201cdecarbonizing\u201d drinks is blowing up on the app. The \u201csmooth, bubble-free\u201d drink comes in four fruit flavors, including strawberry and black cherry, and also meets another need for Gen Z since it\u2019s low in alcohol content at 4.4% by volume. It also has bright packaging designed to \u201cpop on social media,\u201d the brewer notes. Launched less than three months ago, sales and distribution are both growing and feedback has been \u201cextremely positive\u201d for Happy Thursday, the company said on its blog. The company could shed more light on its sales during its next earnings report in August. Happy Thursday fits into the company\u2019s strategy that began in 2019 when Molson Coors tweaked its name to encompass its growing portfolio of beverages besides beer. That now includes hard iced tea, energy drinks and its Simply Spiked lineup. Last year, it acquired Blue Run Spirits, a cult favorite high-end bourbon and rye whiskey brand, in light of US spirit sales\u00a0surpassing beer sales. \u201cSuppliers, in order to stay relevant, have to evolve and follow where the consumer is trending \u2014 and right now the consumer wants flavor,\u201d NIQ\u2019s Theriault said about their pivots. \u201cInnovation is really important in the alcohol industry and ensuring that innovation is tied to the consumer trends is what\u2019s right for business.\u201d Building \u2018beyond beer\u2019 Canned cocktails and spirits-based beverages have also helped Anheuser-Busch\u2019s bottom line in the US, especially in light of the collapsing sales of Bud Light. Its aptly titled \u201cBeyond Beer\u201d category is currently a $1.5 billion part of its global business and is helping attract younger, legally aged drinkers. N\u00dcTRL, a flavorful lineup of vodka seltzers, and Cutwater Spirits canned cocktails are two standouts. An Anheuser-Busch spokesperson told CNN that Cutwater, which has a collection of canned rum mai tais, vodka mules and tequila palomas, has \u201csteadily grown dollar sales double digits for five consecutive years\u201d and jumped an additional 23% in sales this year. Still, it\u2019s not all rosy for Anheuser-Busch, especially if a drink has the Bud Light name attached. Bud Light Seltzer sales are down 50%, according to trade publication Brewbound, outpacing a larger decline in malt-based seltzers as drinkers shift toward spirit-based drinks. The company launched a new advertising campaign in 2023 just a few weeks before the Dylan Mulvaney controversy derailed its parent brand\u2019s sales. Despite younger drinkers\u2019 hesitance with buying beer and flat sales, Big Beer companies aren\u2019t facing an existential threat. In fact, it\u2019s the exact opposite, according to one expert. \u201cYoung drinkers can now find just about any kind of drink in just about any kind of flavor practically whenever they want, and they get to choose from the most diverse collection of beverages that has ever existed \u2014 with and without alcohol,\u201d Bryan Roth, an analyst for Feel Goods Company and editor of the alcohol beverage newsletter, Sightlines+, told\u00a0CNN. \u201cThese long-tenured and often historic companies are adapting to the market. What makes it particularly exciting is that consumers are more often leading the way,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/food/gen-z-drinking-trends-alcohol/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

NBC announced on Wednesday it will use AI software to recreate Michaels\u2019 voice to deliver daily recaps of the Summer Games for subscribers of its Peacock streaming platform, a milestone for the use of AI by a major media company. The use of an AI voice for the Olympics comes as the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, sound and text. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries, such as journalism, about how artificial intelligence can \u2013 or even should \u2013 be used. A new tool, called \u201cYour Daily Olympic Recap on Peacock,\u201d will enable 10-minute highlights packages, which can include events updates, athlete back stories and other related content personalized by subscriber preferences. The company said the highlights could be packaged in about 7 million different ways, pulled from 5,000 hours of live coverage in Paris, effectively making AI (the artificial intelligence, not the man) a significantly more efficient way to deliver personalized recaps.  \u201cWhen I was approached about this, I was skeptical but obviously curious,\u201d Michaels said in a press release. \u201cThen I saw a demonstration detailing what they had in mind. I said, \u2018I\u2019m in.\u2019\u201d A NBC spokesperson told CNN Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. Michaels, a long-time broadcaster, is currently the play-by-play sportscaster for Thursday Night Football on Amazon Prime. He\u2019s also known for his work on previous Olympics Games broadcasts for both NBC and ABC and for calling the Miracle on Ice Game at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. NBC said the AI system was trained using prior NBC broadcast audio from Michaels. The company said a team of NBC Sports editors will review all of the content, including audio and clips, to make sure everything is factually accurate and names are pronounced correctly.

{"id": "2024_06_01_success_buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage", "text": "Moving somewhere new when you retire isn\u2019t uncommon. But deciding whether to take out a new mortgage to buy a home is a big deal. Much of your financial life is changing as you transition from a steady paycheck to a mix of fixed and variable income and a new lifestyle. So adding a large debt to the picture isn\u2019t an easy call. That\u2019s especially true now that mortgage rates hover around 7% and home prices keep rising. \u201cAny time you take on debt, you increase risk in your situation,\u201d said Illinois-based certified financial planner Jim Stork. More than a third (35%) of homebuyers last year were between the ages of 59 and 98, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Within that group, a majority financed their purchases. Whether taking out a new mortgage makes sense for you depends on a lot of factors, including how to prove to a lender that you\u2019re a good credit risk, plus your feelings about the debt and the ongoing cost of maintaining a home. To get a mortgage, your age won\u2019t be a factor, but your income will be If you\u2019re concerned that you may be less attractive to a mortgage banker because you\u2019ve hit retirement age, know that it is illegal to discriminate against anyone applying for a mortgage based on their age. Lenders\u2019 chief focus will be on your ability to repay your mortgage with your various sources of non-paycheck income. \u201cWhen you qualify for a mortgage, it\u2019s all based on your income,\u201d said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage. That, and of course any debt you have that will soak up your income, but we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. The income sources that lenders consider, absent a regular paycheck, include: Social Security benefits, pension or annuity income, spousal benefits, disability payments, interest and dividends and your 401(k) or IRA. If a portion of your income is not subject to tax, the lender may treat it as worth 25% more. Fannie Mae offers this example: Say 15% of a $1,500 monthly Social Security benefit is tax free. That means $225 of it will not be subject to tax ($1,500 x 15%). And 25% of that amount comes to $56 ($225 x 25%). So that $56 can be added to a person\u2019s qualifying Social Security income amount ($1,500 + $56 = $1,556). If you want to use your nest egg, different methods can be used to calculate how much income it would provide. There is the asset depletion method in which your eligible assets are divided by your loan term. In the case of a 30-year mortgage, that would be 360 months. If your IRA is worth $700,000, that translates into $1,944 per month ($700,000/360). \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to take the money out \u2014 but you can use your assets [to qualify for a mortgage] as if you were going to take the distribution,\u201d Cohn said. Another option: If you are at least 59-1/2, you can start taking monthly distributions from an IRA without penalty \u2014 or a 401(k) if your plan rules permit \u2014 and the lender will count that as income so long as you show that you have sufficient funds in the account to keep taking that same monthly distribution for three years. Once you close on your home, Cohn said, you can reduce or stop taking distributions if you choose. That assumes you are not yet in your 70s when the IRS requires you to start taking minimum distributions, said Mark Luscombe, a principal analyst at Wolters, Kluwer Tax & Accounting. Burdened by debt? Lenders will also assess your debt-to-income ratio, because no matter how much income you have, the big question is how much of it will be consumed by your debts. The debt portion is composed of your expected mortgage payment plus any credit card, student loan, car loan or other outstanding debt you may have. Generally speaking, for conventional loans your DTI ratio can be up to 50%, Cohen said. That ratio falls to between 43% and 45% if you\u2019re taking out a jumbo loan, she added. A jumbo loan exceeds the conforming loan limits in the area you want to buy. But ideally your debt level will fall well below these top limits, both for the lender\u2019s sake and yours. And, of course, the higher your credit score, the better the interest rate you can get on a mortgage. What you should consider before taking out a mortgage Even before seeking a mortgage, get a good grasp on your expected monthly income and expenses in retirement. Compared to pre-retirement earnings, \u201cMost (new retirees) see a decrease in income,\u201d said certified financial planner Lori Trawinski, director of finance and employment at AARP. While some expenses may also decline \u2014 e.g., work-related costs like commuting \u2014 others may increase over time, Trawinski said, like medical costs, property taxes, home insurance and utilities. Of course, you can downsize and move to a lower-cost area. But if you stay near where you lived during your career, your expenses are likely to rise over time. Also, Trawinski noted, if you\u2019re married, consider what will happen to your household income when one spouse dies. This will help you assess your future comfort level in carrying a mortgage. \u201cPeople often fail to plan for the death of a spouse. You can take a big hit to your income when that happens,\u201d she said. If you do move to a new state or region, weigh renting first. You can get a better sense of the cost of living in the area and decide whether it\u2019s a good fit for you. As Stork put it, \u201cFlorida in August is not as fun as Florida in January.\u201d How much are you really willing to take on? All the usual financial decisions that go into homebuying apply no matter your age. But, in retirement especially, you don\u2019t want to take on more debt than necessary, since the cost of a mortgage is fixed, but the returns on your investments, the housing market and your health needs are variable. At the very least, Stork said, consider whether you can put enough money down \u2014 at least 20% \u2014 to avoid having to pay private mortgage insurance. Beyond that, consider whether you feel comfortable keeping up \u2014 and paying for \u2014 maintenance on a home. Maintenance might amount to 2% a year of your home\u2019s value, Stork said. That amounts to $10,000 a year on a $500,000 home. Maintenance is essential in preserving the value of your house should you ever decide to sell. How would your mortgage interest rate compare to a reasonable rate of return on your investments? The decision to get a mortgage was a lot easier for retirees when rates were historically low \u2014 roughly 3% \u2014 and their nest eggs were earning a lot more. \u201cBut at today\u2019s rates it\u2019s a much harder calculation,\u201d Stork said. This is especially the case if you\u2019re a very conservative investor. \u201cIf your CDs are earning 4% and a mortgage would cost you 7%, you will lose money every day on that decision,\u201d Stork explained. To get the truest reading on what makes financial sense, compare mortgage expenses to your investment returns on an after-tax basis, Stork noted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/success/buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_business_airbnb-hidden-camera-invs", "text": "It was another lawsuit brought by another victim whose fun-filled vacation turned into a voyeuristic nightmare: A woman was secretly recorded undressing at a rental property, her images stored on the computer of an alleged sexual predator accused of spying on unsuspecting renters for years. Airbnb, one of the world\u2019s largest short-term rental companies, had seen this sort of scenario before. Typically, the company seeks to settle hidden camera cases quickly and confidentially. But this one played out differently. An Airbnb representative testifying at a court-ordered deposition early last year offered a rare glimpse of the company\u2019s hidden camera problem: Airbnb has generated tens of thousands of customer support tickets related to surveillance devices in the last decade. During the hours-long deposition, the Airbnb employee also revealed that when a guest complains of a hidden camera, the company doesn\u2019t \u2013 as a matter of practice \u2013 notify law enforcement, not even when a child is involved. The company may, however, reach out to hosts about complaints as part of internal inquiries \u2013 a move law enforcement experts say could hinder criminal investigations because it gives suspects time to destroy evidence. A CNN investigation found that Airbnb consistently fails to protect its guests despite knowing hidden cameras are a persistent concern within its industry. Airbnb\u2019s corporate strategies, moreover, have been aimed at preventing regulation of the short-term rental market to allow the company to distance itself from responsibility for guest safety and privacy. Thousands of images have been recovered from short-term rental hosts by law enforcement. Hidden cameras placed in bedrooms and bathrooms show guests during their most private moments \u2013 changing clothes, being with their children, even having sex, according to CNN\u2019s review of court and police records, as well as interviews with nearly two dozen guests who found surveillance devices at short-term rental properties or were told by police they had been secretly recorded. Victims say they live under a shadow of fear that those private moments will become internet fodder. \u201cThis is not my Social Security number or my email address. This is my naked body,\u201d said one woman whose host secretly recorded her having sex with her husband at a cottage in Texas. Airbnb declined CNN\u2019s request for an interview. However, in a written statement, a spokesperson said that hidden camera complaints are rare, but when they do occur \u201cwe take appropriate, swift action, which can include removing hosts and listings that violate the policy.\u201d The spokesperson added that \u201cAirbnb\u2019s trust and safety policies lead the vacation rental industry and include background checks on US-based hosts and guests.\u201d CNN found that some of the policies touted by Airbnb come with significant disclaimers. The company\u2019s website, for example, tells users they should not rely on its background checks to identify \u201call past criminal convictions or sex offender registrations \u2026 or other red flags.\u201d And even if Airbnb discovers a user has a criminal background, convictions of \u201cmurder, terrorism, rape or child molestation\u201d are not automatic disqualifiers under the company\u2019s policy. \u2018The Wild West\u2019 Brian Chesky was unemployed when he and his roommate came up with the idea for Airbnb in 2007 while struggling to make rent in San Francisco. For $80 a night, they opened their home to three travelers, offering them air mattresses, breakfast and Wi-Fi. They called their start-up Air Bed and Breakfast. Thirteen years later, the company went public in the largest IPO of 2020, with a valuation of $47 billion. Today, Airbnb \u2013 which is valued higher than Hyatt Hotels Corporation and Marriott International combined \u2013 continues to chase the benefits of being an international hotel chain while shouldering few of the costs or responsibilities. Unlike hotels, Airbnb doesn\u2019t control the properties it advertises or employ on-site staff such as security guards, receptionists or cleaning professionals. Instead, it leaves the costs of maintaining and protecting short-term rentals to hosts. And, while hotels can be held legally responsible for guests harmed on their property, Airbnb frequently is not. In fact, Airbnb has fought against such liability in court, arguing it has little control over what happens at its listings \u2013 despite collecting roughly 17% of each booking. The multi-billion-dollar short-term rental industry paints a rosy picture with advertisements highlighting how home sharing improves human connection and offers intimate, private spaces for busy travelers. Still, violent crime and prostitution, as well as traveler deaths, have repeatedly forced Airbnb and its competitors into the international spotlight. One security concern, which has gone largely unchecked by Airbnb and the rest of the short-term rental market, is hidden cameras. Airbnb has known about the problem for at least a decade and has repeatedly notified its shareholders of the issue in annual reports since the company went public. \u201cWe were aware of it, there were an abundance of cases coming in,\u201d said one former Airbnb employee who asked to remain anonymous due to a non-disclosure agreement with the company. The employee, whose team dealt with safety and privacy issues, said hidden cameras were among the group\u2019s top concerns. Despite those concerns, the company for years allowed video surveillance by hosts in common areas, if the cameras were disclosed to guests. Chloe LeBrument, who traveled to London, Ontario, last summer with her fianc\u00e9 for a music festival, found a camera hidden in a charger in the bedroom at an Airbnb rental. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s many, many people that have left the room having no idea that \u2026 they had been recorded,\u201d said LeBrument, whose host has been criminally charged with voyeurism. LeBrument described feeling angry and disappointed by the experience. \u201cIt felt really gross,\u201d she said. In January, CNN began reaching out to former Airbnb employees to ask about hidden camera concerns within the industry. In early March, Saturday Night Live mocked how ubiquitous the issue is in a skit. Just over a week later, the company announced it would ban all indoor cameras as of April 30. The company said nothing about how it would force hosts to comply with the rules. \u201cYou can have all these great rules, but if no one\u2019s checking that the rules are being followed \u2026 it\u2019s still kind of the Wild West,\u201d said attorney Bianca Zuniga-Goldwater, who represents several hidden camera victims in suits against Airbnb and Vrbo. CNN reviewed more than a dozen police investigations and lawsuits across the US involving at least 75 victims and found Airbnb often moves swiftly to contain user complaints and resolve them out of court. One attorney told CNN that Airbnb settled during a phone call after she gave them a heads up that she was going to file a lawsuit on behalf of a guest who said they found a camera hidden in their room at an Airbnb rental. Airbnb seeks to compel complainants into arbitration, a process that hides cases from public view, according to six attorneys who represented clients in cases against the short-term rental platform. When a settlement is reached, Airbnb has required users to sign confidentiality agreements, which bar them from discussing details of the deal. Airbnb told CNN its use of arbitration and non-disclosure agreements are standard practices within the industry. One man, who was recorded having sex with his wife at an Airbnb rental and received a financial settlement from the company, said he felt \u201cdirty\u201d signing a confidentiality agreement. \u201cWe were gagged,\u201d he said. Last year\u2019s court-ordered deposition, which was part of an ongoing case against Airbnb and has not previously been reported, should have detailed the scope of the company\u2019s hidden camera problem. The company, through its representative, was supposed to comply with a court order to quantify how many complaints or reports had been made to Airbnb by people who had been recorded by surveillance devices since December 1, 2013. The Airbnb representative came to the table with a number. Her testimony revealed the company generated 35,000 customer support tickets about surveillance devices in the preceding decade. In the deposition, the Airbnb representative sought to downplay the significance of the number of tickets, testifying they could reflect instances such as a malfunctioning doorbell camera or a tablet with recording capabilities left out on a coffee table. The representative did not provide any statistics detailing the number of claims she suggested were innocuous among the 35,000 tickets. The Airbnb spokesperson told CNN that a single report could create multiple tickets. The company declined to specify how many unique complaints there have been. CNN reached out to more than 130 former employees who handled safety issues or fielded security concerns for Airbnb\u2019s support line. Of the 24 who responded, nearly half said they couldn\u2019t speak about their experience due to non-disclosure agreements with the company. The few who agreed to be interviewed said one of the most common concerns they heard came from guests who feared they were being surreptitiously recorded. \u201cI\u2019ve never received a call about a doorbell,\u201d one former employee said. \u2018The scariest moment of my life\u2019 in Comfort, Texas David Wyzynajtys and his girlfriend had never used Airbnb before booking a romantic weekend away in July 2021. When the couple spotted a remote property in Texas Hill Country with numerous positive reviews and a host who had earned Airbnb\u2019s coveted \u201csuperhost\u201d status, they booked it. But after the pair arrived at the cottage in Comfort, Texas, and changed for the night, Wyzynajtys noticed something that terrified him: a hidden camera plugged into the wall and pointed directly at the bed. \u201cThe scariest moment of my life,\u201d Wyzynajtys recalled. Wyzynajtys and his partner frantically left the property and drove nearly 10 miles down a dark, winding road to check into a hotel. Rattled, they reached out to Airbnb via a customer support chat feature asking that someone call them. No one did. Instead, the couple received an in-app chat message from Airbnb later that night. According to court records, an Airbnb representative sought permission to report their complaint to the host, a man named A. Jay Allee. \u201cDo you mind if we contact the host and get his side of the story?\u201d\u00a0Wyzynajtys recalled the Airbnb representative asking in the message. The couple was fearful of Allee \u2013 they worried he could have been watching them through a livestream as they discovered the device and hurried to leave. Wanting to avoid a confrontation, Wyzynajtys denied Airbnb\u2019s request. Wyzynajtys said Airbnb was \u201ctotally just negligent or didn\u2019t care about it at all.\u201d The next day, Wyzynajtys contacted law enforcement. Police obtained a search warrant and raided Allee\u2019s property, confiscating cell phones, computers, and the camera, which Allee had been using to record guests for much of a year. Among the more than 2,000 recovered images, law enforcement identified more than 30 victims, including several children. Many guests \u2013 who booked the same property either through Airbnb or Vrbo \u2013 were captured in various stages of undress. Some were recorded having sex. Allee was later charged with 15 counts of invasive visual recording and pleaded guilty to six of them. Thirteen people who stayed at Allee\u2019s cottage \u2013 including two minors \u2013 sued Airbnb in California state court in July 2022. Airbnb settled with the plaintiffs six months later. A suit against Vrbo, filed by three couples who stayed at Allee\u2019s property and were all recorded being intimate with their partners, is ongoing. Allee held Airbnb\u2019s superhost status. The rank, which is granted by the company\u2019s algorithm, provides higher visibility and earning potential, according to Airbnb\u2019s website. On Vrbo\u2019s platform, he was similarly designated as a \u201cpremier host.\u201d One of Allee\u2019s victims said that superhost status was one of the reasons he and his family had chosen the property for their weekend away. \u201cIt kind of infers that a lot of people have good experiences there,\u201d said the victim, who asked not to be named due to privacy concerns. Some victims who spoke to CNN left positive reviews for stays \u2013 thus feeding the algorithm for a host\u2019s elevated status \u2013 only to later learn from law enforcement they had been secretly recorded. \u201cThank you for sharing your beautiful ranch with us,\u201d one of Allee\u2019s victims, who was recorded having sex with his partner, wrote in a Vrbo review after their stay in 2020. \u201cWe had an amazing time for our anniversary. We enjoyed feeding the animals and sitting by the fire at night just enjoying the silence. We will stay here again!\u201d A Vrbo spokesperson noted the company prohibits any cameras that capture the inside of a property and that \u201ctrust and safety are part of Vrbo\u2019s legacy.\u201d Vrbo didn\u2019t respond to questions about Allee or its policies. Lt. Butch Matjeka of the Kendall County Sheriff\u2019s Office notified Airbnb of his investigation into Allee in October 2021, police records show. Almost two months later \u2013 and five months after Wyzynajtys found the camera \u2013 Allee\u2019s listing remained active on Airbnb\u2019s site, according to a lawsuit against the company. \u201cFrom a law enforcement perspective, if I tell you that I\u2019m investigating then you should stop hosting that individual on your site until the outcome of my investigation,\u201d Matjeka said. Regulations are \u2018bad for business\u2019 Earlier this year, lawmakers in the European Union agreed to groundbreaking regulations governing the short-term rental industry. The new rules will require host registration, data sharing by the company and quality control of listings. Airbnb hailed the regulations as a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for the industry and praised the EU-wide approach. Its public praise belies the fact that Airbnb has fought European cities for attempting to regulate the industry, said Kim van Sparrentak, a member of the European Parliament, who steered the legislation through the governing body. \u201cAirbnb is similar to other sharing economy companies \u2013 on a municipal level that means filing lawsuits as soon as any regulation is proposed,\u201d she said, referring to the company\u2019s strategy of fighting regulations in court. There are no similar federal regulations in the United States. Instead, local municipalities have been left to govern the fast-growing industry. In the cities that have been successful in introducing regulations \u2013 such as requiring hosts to register with local authorities \u2013 it has, at times, been difficult to get Airbnb to comply. Some of those regulations could assist with criminal investigations. When the city of New York enacted a law last year that requires hosts to register with the city and prohibits platforms from processing transactions for hosts that fail to comply, Airbnb responded by filing a lawsuit calling the measures \u201cextreme and oppressive\u201d and said the restrictions would cause the company \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s bad for business for them to follow regulations,\u201d said Murray Cox, who runs the nonprofit watchdog organization Inside Airbnb. Complying with rules, he said, often means excluding business from Airbnb\u2019s platform, which cuts into the company\u2019s bottom line. \u201cIt\u2019s about corporate greed.\u201d Airbnb\u2019s legal weapon of choice in its fight against regulations \u2013 and in at least one case against a guest who claimed she was injured while staying at an Airbnb rental \u2013 stems from a decades-old law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The law, often propped up as a defense by tech giants such as Facebook and X, states the platforms cannot be held responsible for user-posted content. But for Airbnb, the argument has not always been successful. The judge presiding over the New York case, for example, pointed out that this legal protection didn\u2019t apply to Airbnb because the company makes money on booking transactions. \u201cThey say that if you\u2019re going to participate in the transaction, then (Section 230) is off the table,\u201d said Cox. To Shannon Schott, a Florida-based attorney who settled with Airbnb after her client said he found a hidden camera at his rental, Airbnb\u2019s use of Section 230 should be concerning to users who value their privacy and safety. \u201cThey\u2019re not arguing: This didn\u2019t happen, your client isn\u2019t injured. They\u2019re arguing: We aren\u2019t responsible,\u201d Schott said. Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky, who has introduced legislation that aims to curb big technology companies\u2019 use of Section 230, argued that the platform would be safer if Airbnb were forced to take responsibility for what happens at its listings. Right now, Section 230 is used as a \u201cget out of jail free card,\u201d the Democratic lawmaker said. Broken promises Less than 20 miles from Airbnb\u2019s San Francisco headquarters, a 2019 Halloween party turned deadly at a rental property in California\u2019s wealthy Orinda community. People fled as shots rang out, and when the dust had  settled, five people were dead. The crime remains unsolved. The carnage prompted Airbnb to re-examine parts of its business model, cracking down on party homes and vowing to verify all listings and user identities. \u201cEvery home and every host on Airbnb will be reviewed with the objective of 100% verification\u201d by the end of 2020, Chesky, the company\u2019s CEO, promised after the shooting. In March, Airbnb disclosed only about 20% of its property listings worldwide had been verified. However, the company has boasted that every host, co-host and booking guest is identity-verified. That accomplishment comes with a big disclaimer: Its identity verification badge \u201cdoes not guarantee that someone is who they claim to be,\u201d the company\u2019s website states. Nor does Airbnb\u2019s identify verification process necessarily uncover a user\u2019s criminal history. Earlier this year, Airbnb guests in the outskirts of Melbourne, Australia, were shocked to learn their host, with whom they shared their rental home, was a registered sex offender. According to a local news report that reviewed the listing at the time, Airbnb had verified the identity of the host. However, the identification process didn\u2019t appear to surface the 11 charges of sexual assault on a mentally disabled person \u2013 for which the host spent more than four years in prison. Airbnb told the news outlet it suspended the host\u2019s account after it learned of the criminal conviction. Background checks appear to go beyond identity verification and involve searching public databases for users\u2019 information. The checks, which Airbnb says are conducted by a third party, could notify the company of users\u2019 criminal histories. However, the company makes no guarantees to perform them on every user worldwide. On its website, Airbnb says it may run a background check if it has at least a first name, last name and date of birth for US-based users who create listings. Still, the company warns travelers they shouldn\u2019t rely on its background checks to uncover all convictions, sex offender registrations or other red flags for its users. \u2018Digital content is forever\u2019 Allee was released from jail in February following a one-year sentence. His attorney didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Police identified more than 30 suspected victims who stayed at Allee\u2019s cottage but could only file charges in connection with 15. To some of those victims, his brief stint behind bars didn\u2019t suit the crime. \u201cLess than a month for every victim,\u201d said Wyzynajtys, the guest who found Allee\u2019s hidden camera. However, Allee\u2019s lenient sentence was not unusual. In most states, and on the federal level, video voyeurism is a misdemeanor, punishable by no more than a year behind bars. In 2022, Airbnb superhost Peter Madden pleaded guilty to seven counts of violation of privacy in connection with recording five guests at his property in Maine, according to the Cumberland County District Attorney. During an interview with police, Madden initially denied ownership of the camera, which was concealed in a clock radio and pointed at his guests\u2019 bed. Then, he said he put it there for security reasons. Ultimately, Madden, whose attorney didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment, admitted he\u2019d been recording guests engaged in sexual activity. \u201cThere\u2019s stuff of a couple of couples playing around or getting changed,\u201d he conceded when pressed by an officer about what images the camera captured. \u201cAre you a voyeur?\u201d the officer asked, according to a recording obtained by CNN. In response, Madden laughed. \u201cI\u2019m an artist,\u201d he said. \u201cI look at everything, I study everything.\u201d Madden served 14 days behind bars. Victims, on the other hand, suffer lengthier consequences. All of Allee\u2019s victims who spoke with CNN, seven in total, said they suffered long-term trauma due to Allee\u2019s actions. They also detailed the crippling fear that their images \u2013 or those of their kids \u2013 will one day end up online, if they haven\u2019t already. \u201cWhat is made into digital content is forever,\u201d said the woman who was secretly recorded having sex with her husband at Allee\u2019s cottage. An intensive care nurse who visited Allee\u2019s property at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic continues to suffer from \u201csocial distress around the personal nature of the recordings and the possibility that they will become public,\u201d according to the lawsuit she filed against Vrbo. Several images on Allee\u2019s computer showed the nurse undressed and being intimate with her husband. Others captured her infant son, police records show. Vrbo didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s inquiries about the case. One couple \u2013 who stayed there to celebrate an anniversary \u2013 said they felt \u201cshocked and appalled\u201d by the experience and worried that strangers had seen images of their private moments. One woman said she now takes medication to treat feelings of paranoia. \u201cIt\u2019s violating,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cWho knows where that footage went and who saw that?\u201d   Senior Investigative Correspondent: Kyung LahExecutive Producer: Patricia DiCarloManaging Editor: Matt LaitDeputy Managing Editor: Samira JafariVideo Producer: John GeneralSupervising Producer: Logan WhitesidePhoto Editor: Austin SteeleContributor: Yahya Abou-Ghazala", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/business/airbnb-hidden-camera-invs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_economy_us-jobs-report-june-preview", "text": "The US labor market has held its own despite swirling forces \u2014 high inflation, an aggressive interest-rate-hiking campaign, pandemic aftershocks and geopolitical uncertainty \u2014 that seemed all but certain to trigger a recession. Monthly job gains have frequently come in stronger than expected, and unemployment has held at or below 4% for 30 consecutive months. That said, the job market of today is far different than it was 30 months ago. \u201cThe labor market has normalized,\u201d Luke Tilley, Wilmington Trust\u2019s chief economist, told CNN in an interview. But, he cautioned, \u201cthe concern would be if it worsened from here.\u201d Economists don\u2019t believe job gains will fall off a cliff when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases employment data for June on Friday morning. In fact, the monthly payroll gains should remain strong and steady, but gradually cooling: Economists expect the US added 190,000 jobs last month, a pullback from the stronger-than-expected 272,000 gain in May, and for unemployment to hold steady at 4%, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Still, there\u2019s a growing chorus of data that shows the economy is slowing, consumer spending is letting up and workers are feeling less secure. As such, Friday\u2019s report could provide a crucial signal as to whether the jobs market is at a stable or even pre-pandemic state \u2014 or is perhaps weaker than advertised. \u201cI think as long as the job gains continue to show a gradual cooling, this economy is in good shape,\u201d said Nela Richardson, ADP\u2019s chief economist, during a call with reporters on Wednesday following the payroll processor\u2019s latest report showing job and wage gains slowed in the private sector. ADP estimated that private employers added 150,000 jobs last month, down from 157,000 in May. \u201cIf we see the cooldown go from gradual to steep, I think that\u2019s a warning,\u201d she said. Whether the two surveys will still tell different tales In May, the two surveys that feed into the monthly jobs report appeared to be telling different stories: The business survey showed employers adding jobs at a still-robust pace, and the household survey showed a 408,000 drop in employment. While the establishment survey is considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d by economists, the household survey, which provides greater detail on demographics and feeds into the unemployment rate, is viewed as more volatile because of its smaller sample size and declining response rates. \u201cThe establishment and household surveys are continuing to show diametrically opposed pictures of the labor market,\u201d Dean Baker, economist and co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, wrote in a note issued earlier this week. \u201cThe persistence of this large divergence is disconcerting,\u201d he added. \u201cMost other data seem to fit better with the establishment survey, although we are seeing evidence of a weakening labor market.\u201d Notably, there are fewer job openings, hiring has pulled back, people aren\u2019t as willing to test the waters and are staying put in their current jobs; and, perhaps most importantly, layoff activity has been climbing steadily higher in recent weeks. Are permanent job losers on the rise? Last week, there were an estimated 238,000 first-time claims filed for unemployment benefits, an increase of 4,000 from the week before, according to Department of Labor data released Wednesday. The latest uptick brought the four-week average of initial claims to its highest level since August 2023. Also, Americans are staying unemployed for longer: Continuing claims, which are filed by people who have received benefits for at least a week or more, rose to their highest level since November 2021. The continued upswing in claims has Tilley closely watching an underlying datapoint of the monthly jobs report: Unemployed persons by reason for unemployment. \u201cOn a three-month average basis, it\u2019s up about 200,000 people from last year,\u201d Tilley said. \u201cAnd that metric of permanent job losers, year-over-year, is almost never positive in an expansion. It was never positive between 2010 and 2019; it was not positive in between the tech crash recession of 2001 and then 2008.\u201d He added: \u201cSo when you sort of peel back the onion from what looks like very strong job growth in a raw number count and look at it a little closer \u2026 that paints a labor market that has normalized and is at risk of slipping.\u201d Still, other measures of layoff activity haven\u2019t shown a worrisome spike. US-based employers announced fewer job cuts last month than they did in May; however, those layoff reports are trending well above last year\u2019s, according to data released Wednesday by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The outplacement and workplace research firm counted 48,786 cuts announced in June. That\u2019s down nearly 24% from the 63,618 cuts announced in May, but 19.8% higher than the 40,709 cuts announced in June last year. How immigrants contribute to the labor market Since August 2022, monthly payroll gains have averaged 250,000 per month, which is much faster than the 2019 average of 164,000, noted Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. \u201cIn other words, we\u2019re achieving much higher job growth with about the same unemployment rate, at a time when the native-born population is stagnant,\u201d Pollak told CNN via email. \u201cOne key reason is\u00a0immigration\u00a0and its effect on labor supply.\u201d Immigrants accounted for 43% of the labor force gain in 2024, Rachel Sederberg, senior economist at labor market research firm Lightcast, told CNN Business. In May, that share skyrocketed to 280%, as the immigrant gains more than made up for the native-born workers who left the labor force, she said. The job gains made by immigrants have become another flashpoint in an already heavily contentious presidential election. During the CNN debate last week between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, the latter falsely claimed that all job gains since Biden took office were made by illegal immigrants and \u201cbounce-back jobs.\u201d \u201cMost research does not find that\u00a0immigration\u00a0harms employment outcomes for native-born Americans because immigrants are both consumers and producers of goods and services, so they may increase job competition in some areas but they also increase demand for goods and services, which creates jobs,\u201d Pollak noted. Other indicators to watch Average hourly earnings: Workers\u2019 pay gains have been slowing, and that\u2019s expected to continue in June. Economists expect that the month-on-month gains should come in around 0.3%, from 0.4% in May, and for annual gains to cool to 3.9% from 4.1%. This is an indicator that Federal Reserve officials have watched closely as a potential inflationary pressure. Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday said the labor market has seen a \u201cpretty substantial move\u201d toward getting back into a better balance. While speaking at the ECB\u2019s annual conference in Portugal, Powell noted the unemployment rate was moving up toward \u201ca more sustainable level,\u201d as were wage increases. \u201cWage increases are still a bit above where they would wind up in equilibrium; but nonetheless, you can see the labor market is cooling off appropriately,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re watching it very carefully, but it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s heating up or presenting a big problem for inflation.\u201d Labor force participation rates: While prime working-age women have experienced record-high employment in recent months, other measures of labor force participation continue to remain below pre-pandemic levels. The overall labor force participation rate dipped in May to 62.5% from 62.7%, reversing progress made earlier this year. Part-time workers: New data from employment site Indeed indicated that employers are looking to hire more part-time workers. The number of involuntary part-time workers has increased in recent months. \u201cThey\u2019d like full-time hours but can\u2019t get them, which is potentially an indicator of a softening labor market,\u201d according to Lightcast\u2019s Sederberg. \u201cThat said, the number of people who are involuntarily part time are still very, very low.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/economy/us-jobs-report-june-preview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_tech_meta-eu-competition-rules", "text": "Facebook parent Meta has been accused of breaking Europe\u2019s new digital competition rules over its \u201cpay or consent\u201d advertising model. Late last year, Meta (META)\u00a0launched\u00a0a service called \u201cSubscription for no ads,\u201d allowing European users of Facebook and Instagram to pay up to \u20ac12.99 ($14) a month for ad-free versions. The alternative is to accept versions with personalized ads. The European Commission said in a statement Monday that, in its preliminary view, \u201cthis binary choice forces users to consent to the (use) of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalized but equivalent version of Meta\u2019s social networks.\u201d If the provisional findings of the Commission\u2019s investigation are confirmed, the EU could hit Meta with a fine equivalent to 10% of its global annual revenue under its landmark Digital Markets Act. Based on the company\u2019s 2023 results, that would amount to $13.5 billion. Meta said it didn\u2019t accept the Commission\u2019s findings. \u201c\u2019Subscription for no ads\u2019 follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.\u201d The EU announcement comes a week after the Commission accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the DMA by preventing app developers from freely directing consumers to cheaper services. The regulators are also investigating Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) under the new law. The DMA, which came into force in March, requires dominant online platforms \u2014 so-called gatekeepers \u2014 to give users more choice, and rivals more opportunities to compete. Online platforms often collect personal data across their own and third-party services and use it in digital advertising services. Margrethe Vestager, a European Commissioner in charge of competition policy, noted in Monday\u2019s statement that Meta had been accumulating personal data of \u201cmillions of EU citizens over many years.\u201d \u201cWe want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalized ads experience,\u201d she said. Michael Koenig, a senior official at the Commission, said Meta must offer users an alternative to \u201cfull\u201d ad personalization that \u201cdoes not rely on this personal data and which is then automatically less personalized and still available to them.\u201d \u201cThen Meta is free to keep a third option, which is a subscription not to see ads at all, or a fourth option which may have some premium features,\u201d he told journalists. The Commission is due to conclude its probe into Meta by late March next year.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said.

{"id": "2024_07_10_media_george-stephanopoulos-biden-tmz-video", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. George Stephanopoulos, sporting a T-shirt, shorts, and over-the-ear headphones, was traversing the New York City streets by foot on Tuesday when he was approached by a stranger who asked for his thoughts on\u00a0President Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0fitness for office. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can serve four more years,\u201d candidly replied the\u00a0ABC News\u00a0anchor, who had just sat down with Biden a few days earlier for his first on-camera television interview following the\u00a0CNN\u00a0presidential debate. The blunt remark from Stephanopoulos \u2014 video of which\u00a0made its way\u00a0to\u00a0TMZ\u00a0\u2014 served as the latest example of the news media turning on Biden, expressing strong concerns about whether he has the fortitude to defeat\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0in November and then serve an additional term in office. On Tuesday night, Stephanopoulos expressed regret for his frank remark, saying through a spokesperson, \u201cEarlier today I responded to a question from a passerby. I shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d (Notably, Stephanopoulos did not withdraw the viewpoint he articulated, but simply said he shouldn\u2019t have expressed it.) ABC News separately said that Stephanopoulos \u201cexpressed his own point of view and not the position of ABC News.\u201d Regardless, any damage inflicted by the comment was already done. It goes without saying that Stephanopoulos is far from alone amongst his peers in the news media in sharing that opinion. Whether fair or unfair (and I do believe you can argue some of the coverage over the past two weeks has been over the top and irresponsible), the reality is that Biden has, at this juncture, lost much of the press corps. Many journalists simply do not buy the narrative that Biden, his campaign, and the White House are selling. \u201cTo Serve His Country, President Biden Should Leave the Race,\u201d The New York Times\u00a0editorial board titled a\u00a0scathing piece\u00a0last week as several other prominent figures called for him to step aside. That loss of trust poses a significant challenge for Biden as he tries to convince the American public that he is up for the difficult task before him. Every move Biden makes, every sentence he utters, has now fallen under a microscope, never a good sign for a political candidate. Worse for Biden, he is no longer being given the benefit of the doubt. In fact, just the opposite. The president said this week that he does not care about what \u201cthe elites\u201d think about his candidacy. But, given his decades in politics, he surely knows that alienating and going to war with the news media is not a winning strategy. Whether he likes it or not, how the news media covers his campaign influences how millions of Americans view his fitness for office. And given how close the 2024 race already was\u00a0before\u00a0the CNN debate, the recent coverage battering Biden\u2019s campaign poses a grave threat to its livelihood. How Biden might manage to pull himself out of this media storm threatening to consume his candidacy remains to be seen. Can he? Thus far, the steps Biden has taken to win back trust have failed to deliver the desired outcome. The Stephanopoulos interview is the perfect example of that. Instead of helping him move forward, granting the interview has effectively backfired, with Biden failing to even convince Stephanopoulos with his message. The fact that the president could not convince the interviewer his campaign hand-picked for his first post-debate sit-down of his ability to lead the nation for the next four years does not bode well for his campaign.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/media/george-stephanopoulos-biden-tmz-video/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_business_economy-inflation-jobs-fed", "text": "The biggest danger facing the American economy for years has been inflation. Now, another problem is emerging as a credible threat on the horizon: Unemployment. Just as inflation continues to cool, yellow lights are flashing in the still-strong jobs market. The Federal Reserve must now confront the risk that it\u2019s making a mistake by keeping interest rates too high for too long. That\u2019s why some economists are pleading with the Fed to ease up its inflation fight\u2014before  high interest rates, which it\u2019s used to tame surging prices, grind the US economy into a recession. \u201cIt\u2019s time to cut rates,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. \u201cInflation is fading as the primary focus of concern. The balance of risks is slowly tipping towards higher unemployment.\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said the labor market is straining under the weight of high borrowing costs. \u201cThe biggest danger is a policy mistake: The Fed keeps rates too high for too long,\u201d Zandi told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cRight now, the Fed is signaling a September cut. I think that\u2019s okay, but if they wait any longer than that, I fear they are going to overdo it.\u201d Even Fed Chair Jerome Powell is acknowledging a significant shift in the risk calculus. \u201cElevated inflation is not the only risk we face,\u201d Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday, pointing to easing inflation and \u201ccooling\u201d in the labor market. \u2018The labor market may be turning\u2019 To be clear, the jobs market is by no means imploding. Jobs are still being created at a healthy pace \u2014 faster than many thought possible just a year ago. Yet just beneath the surface, cracks have begun to emerge. The unemployment rate remains historically low, but it has noticeably crept higher three months in a row \u2014 \u201ca sign the labor market may be turning,\u201d according to economists at KPMG. Hiring has slowed in leisure and hospitality, a key sector that is powered by consumer spending. The pace of workers quitting their jobs has dropped significantly. So has the rate of workers getting hired. Powell highlighted these changes, telling lawmakers that recent indicators \u201csend a pretty clear signal that labor market conditions have cooled considerably\u201d from two years. \u201cThis is no longer an overheated economy,\u201d Powell said. Of course, that\u2019s exactly what the Fed wanted to accomplish when it began its historic rate hiking campaign. The fear in 2022 was that the jobs market was so hot that it would add fuel to white-hot inflation growth and keep prices dangerously high, forcing the Fed to start a recession just to put the inflation fire out. Overheated inflation and a historically over-abundant job market are no longer viewed as major concerns. Waiting too long? The current risk is that the Fed is injecting inflation-fighting medicine into an economy that no longer needs it. And that could turn a cooling job market into one that\u2019s frozen\u2014leading to job losses. The job market added 206,000 positions in June, according to the latest government figures released Friday. In other words, it\u2019s not too hot, and not too cold\u2014it\u2019s \u201cbalanced,\u201d the Fed Chair said on Tuesday.  \u201cA balanced labor market with too restrictive rates from the Fed will not remain balanced for long,\u201d Brusuelas said. \u201cThat means higher unemployment.\u201d Brusuelas clarified that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean \u201cskyrocketing\u201d unemployment is on the horizon, but a premature recession may be, nonetheless, if the Fed waits too long to cut rates. In a Monday report, KPMG senior economist Ken Kim noted that the unemployment rate is close to triggering the Sahm Rule, which signals a recession has started when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate increases by 0.5 percentage points or more above the three-month average. Kim also pointed to how the services sector \u2014 a key engine of growth for the US economy \u2014 is suddenly showing signs of weakness. \u201cNo longer is inflation the predominant concern,\u201d Kim wrote. \u201cEqually as worrisome for the Fed should be the potential for a sharper deterioration in the labor market and economic activity. A soft landing is the goal but a hard landing is emerging as a tail risk.\u201d Inflation isn\u2019t gone Of course, the high cost of living remains a major concern for Americans. Although the rate of inflation has slowed sharply from 9% in June 2022, there is a painful snowballing effect from more than two years of sharp price gains. Americans are paying much more for groceries, rent and insurance than before Covid-19. And there are still risks on the inflation front. The war in the Middle East continues, posing a potential threat to energy production in the region. The same is true of the Russia-Ukraine war, where oil refineries deep inside Russia have been hit by drone attacks. The upcoming US election also creates significant uncertainty \u2014 and complications. Some mainstream economists are concerned that former President Donald Trump\u2019s economic agenda \u2014 tax cuts, immigration crackdown and tariff hikes \u2014 would \u201creignite\u201d inflation. Plus, cutting rates just before the US election could cause the Fed to be \u201cthrown into the political cauldron\u2014a place it doesn\u2019t want to be,\u201d said Zandi, the Moody\u2019s economist. Learning from the past If the Fed cuts rates prematurely, it could stimulate demand from consumers and businesses. That could boost inflation and make matters worse. Powell and his colleagues face a difficult decision\u2014and they don\u2019t want to repeat mistakes of the past. In the 1970s, the Fed rapidly spiked rates but then lowered them before inflation was defeated. Inflation roared back and forced the Fed to take even more drastic steps. More recently, the Powell-led Fed was slow to the inflation fight, waiting too long to respond to price spikes because officials (and many economists) thought inflation was \u201ctransitory,\u201d and would dissipate on its own. \u201cThey have PTSD from what happened before,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cThey made a mistake in not raising rates fast enough. Now they run the risk of keeping rates too high for too long.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/business/economy-inflation-jobs-fed/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_tech_samsung-z-fold-flip-6", "text": "Samsung\u2019s latest generation of foldable phones aim to draw in traditional phone users with the help of artificial intelligence. At its annual Unpacked event on Wednesday, held in Paris for the first time, the company announced updates to its foldable devices and earbuds, and shared more details about its upcoming smart ring. The stars of the show, however, are Samsung\u2019s latest foldables phones, now lighter, slimmer and packed with AI tools: the Galaxy Z Fold 6, a smartphone that opens outward like a book to form a tablet, and the clamshell-like Galaxy Z Flip 6, with a design reminiscent of flip phones from the early 2000s. The company says both devices feature a more durable hinge, better battery life and run on Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor optimized for AI processing. These upgrades, however, come with a higher cost. The new Galaxy Z Fold starts at $1,899.99, up $100 from last year, and is available in silver, pink and navy. Meanwhile, the Z Flip starts at $1,099.99 (also $100 more than last year) and comes in silver, yellow, blue and mint. The devices go on sale Wednesday. Price remains one of the biggest challenges to get consumers on board with foldable smartphones. According to ABI Research, foldable shipments reached 20 million in 2023, which is likely to improve to around 28 million units in 2024, or less than 3% of total shipments. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, believes foldable displays will also find their way into other mobile products, such as tablets, laptops, and smartwatches over the coming years, but most manufacturers are currently focused on getting consumers comfortable with foldable phones. \u201cWhile the user experience of foldable devices has improved through each new iteration, the sector has still yet to fully convince consumers of the improved use cases, tactile benefits, and the added functionality of a foldable product,\u201d he said. Ahead of the event, TM Roh \u2014 Samsung\u2019s president and head of mobile experience \u2014 told CNN the new price is reflective of component costs but could come down more in the future. \u201cThe price depends a lot on how the related technologies develop and how fast they evolve in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do believe it will take time (for the prices to drop), so as of now we are focusing more on the premium aspects.\u201d Roh also believes its Galaxy AI software will continue to keep its foldable line a market leader, at a time when other flip and fold models from companies such as Google, Huawei and Motorola roll out compelling options. Samsung\u2019s foldable line occupies between 80% and 85% of the market share. (Some expect Apple to launch a foldable iPhone in the next few years). In addition to a lighter design, the latest Galaxy Z Fold 6 goes up in size to a 6.3-inch cover screen, up slightly from 6.2 inches, to help enhance user productivity. At the same time, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 has a new 3.4-inch Super AMOLED screen and camera system, featuring a 50MP wide lens that supports 2 times optical zoom and 12MP ultra-wide sensors promising more details in pictures. Samsung\u2019s big AI push Both the Flip and Fold are packed with new AI tools, including an updated Note Assist feature that enables transcription, translation and summarizing of voice recordings directly in Notes, and live translation for phone calls. Another new feature called Composer from the Samsung Keyboard creates text suggestions based on keywords for email and social media apps, aiming to reflect your tone by analyzing previous posts. Google\u2019s AI assistant Gemini is also directly built into the phone. Users can say \u201cHey Google\u201d or swipe the corner of the screen to get help with writing or doing web searches. Other features include a circle to search tool and a feature that provides image options based on simple sketches or drawings when Samsung\u2019s S Pen stylus is used. AI has been on smartphones for years, such as Siri and Google Assistant, but the new generative AI features seek to improve the overall user experience particularly when it comes to getting work done, according to McQueen. \u201cThe addition of generative AI in smartphones will be key to launching a plethora of AI-powered applications and tools that will help re-stimulate market demand as consumers move from just entertainment to enhanced productivity devices,\u201d he said. Roh told CNN that AI is deeply integrated into its Galaxy products and that Samsung is also taking a hybrid approach when it comes to privacy, allowing users the option to decide when AI requests are performed directly on the device or in the cloud. \u201cIf privacy is more important to you, or if low latency is more important, someone can use on-device AI instead versus having a higher capacity, greater performance where they can leverage a cloud-based AI,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can provide optimal technology given the consumer\u2019s use case so that our devices would no longer be just called the smartphone but more of an AI phone.\u201d Beyond the foldables Although Samsung previously teased its smart Ring that\u2019s worn on a finger earlier this year, the company unveiled pricing and new specs related to the device. The ring, which is packed with sensors, offers health monitoring, such as the ability to take your temperature, sleep tracking and personalized insights. The device, which comes in black, silver and gold, will likely go head to head with smart ring market leader Oura. Pricing starts at $399.99 and goes on sale Wednesday. According to IDC Research, smart rings are the fastest growing segment in wearables, with 29% year over year growth over the next 5 years. Francisco Jeronimo, a VP of data and analytics at IDC, said consumers should be drawn to the product because it\u2019s a \u201cless intrusive\u201d form factor than a smartwatch but still tracks key vitals. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Apple announced its own ring sometime soon,\u201d Jeronimo said. \u201cOf course it could cannibalize the sales of smartwatches but we don\u2019t think it will be a massive concern.\u201d That\u2019s because people might prefer to use a smartwatch for its ability to send messages or perform advanced health tracking, such as doing an EKG. But those same people might prefer to sleep with a smart ring on their finger rather than a smartwatch on their wrist. Meanwhile, the new Galaxy Buds 3, which starts at $179.99, now includes an interpreter mode that allows users to get lectures or meetings translated in real time into other languages. It also adds new control functions for playing or stopping music without needing to physically touch the earbuds. It comes in white and silver and goes on sale Wednesday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/tech/samsung-z-fold-flip-6/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_07_10_tech_south-korea-samsung-indefinite-strike-intl-hnk", "text": "The largest labor union at Samsung Electronics in South Korea has declared an indefinite strike after a three-day walkout failed to yield any ground in a tense dispute\u00a0between workers and the tech giant over pay and bonuses. The announcement Wednesday follows a strike earlier this week\u00a0involving 6,000 workers, mainly from the company\u2019s semiconductor division, according to the union. The National Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU) said that its 31,000 members \u2014 representing a nearly quarter of the company\u2019s total workforce in the country \u2014 would launch an indefinite strike from July 10 \u2014 the largest labor action in the smartphone and chipmaking giant\u2019s 55-year history. The company will \u201cregret this decision\u201d of not coming to the negotiation table, the union said in a statement posted on its official website. The longer the strike lasts, the more likely it is that management will \u201ckneel down\u201d and hold a dialogue, the NSEU said, adding that they\u2019re \u201cconfident of victory.\u201d  Samsung Electronics said in a statement Wednesday the company \u201cremains committed to engaging in good faith negotiations with the union,\u201d adding that it will \u201censure no disruptions occur in the production lines.\u201d However, Son Woomok, the union leader, told CNN Monday that \u201cit will take a long time to restore facilities that are shut down due to a strike.\u201d The dispute first came to attention in June, when the union staged a one-day\u00a0strike following failed talks over transparent pay structure and better working conditions. The world\u2019s biggest memory chipmaker has had a rough few years. A historic\u00a0shortage\u00a0of computer chips during the Covid\u00a0pandemic\u00a0was followed by falling demand last year as consumer appetite for electronics remained weak because of global economic uncertainty. But things are looking up for the company because of the AI boom. It is hopeful about a resurgence in demand for mobile devices this year, particularly with the rollout of new products, such as AI-powered smartphones. Samsung Electronics said last week that it estimates a more than 15-fold rise in its second-quarter operating profit, as compared to the same time previous year. The workers want this optimism reflected in their pay. \u201cThe company is not treating the employees properly,\u201d said Woomok on Monday. \u201cEven though the operating profit is high, the company has been saying it\u2019s in a crisis situation for over 10 years, and employees are increasingly dissatisfied with the lack of performance bonus increases,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/tech/south-korea-samsung-indefinite-strike-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_business_heat-keep-your-power-bill-down", "text": "Emma Corrado tries to be conscious of her electricity usage, both as an aspiring biosystems engineer with a focus on natural resources and a self-proclaimed \u201cbroke college student\u201d at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. But on the tail of a record-breaking heatwave that swept the Midwest and Northeast, she\u2019s finding it difficult to keep costs down. Corrado told CNN that the power bill for the two-bedroom apartment she shares with a roommate in Madison, Wisconsin, usually averages about $21 a month. Come summer, it spikes to $100\u2014 a jump she attributes to the cost of air conditioning. To escape the sweltering temperatures, Corrado seeks refuge at her workplace rather than keeping the air conditioner running at home. \u201cI have the option to work remotely, but I tend not to because the building we work in has really good AC,\u201d she said. Americans\u2019 power bills are expected to soar this summer, as heat waves have already begun baking parts of the country. But experts say there are ways to keep cool without breaking the bank \u2013 or at least to limit how much you\u2019re shelling out each month. Be strategic with your temperature setting Do use your air conditioner or other systems to keep cool. \u201cHeat is the number one weather-related killer,\u201d said Annie Carforo, climate justice campaigns manager for WE ACT for Environmental Justice, a community activist group. Carforo cited New York City\u2019s 2024 Heat-Related Mortality Report, which found that the most likely location for heat-related deaths was inside homes that had no AC or had an AC that was not in use. But be mindful of the temperature to which you set your air conditioner. \u201cWe advise people to set your air conditioner to the highest temperature that you\u2019re comfortable with,\u201d said Jamie McShane, director of media relations for New York-based energy company Con Edison. \u201cEvery degree that you increase the thermostat lowers your cost.\u201d Carforo says that some Americans are keeping their air conditioners off entirely when they head out for the day. But keeping your AC off when you\u2019re not home may actually result in higher bills later on. According to the Department of Energy, the smaller the difference between the temperatures inside and outside your home, the lower your overall cooling bill will be. The department says that setting your thermostat to a colder setting when you first turn on your AC may result in unnecessary expenses as it forces your AC to work harder to offset the outside heat. For this reason, it recommends equipping your home with a programmable thermostat that can adjust the temperature according to a preset schedule. \u201cYou can keep (your temperature) up to 78 and still be perfectly safe,\u201d said Mark Wolfe, the executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, but he advises against making the change abruptly. Instead, he recommends gradually upping the thermostat by one degree every couple of days to acclimate to the new temperature. Invest in your home\u2019s energy efficiency Wolfe anticipates that Americans may need to spend more on their electricity bill as climate change makes for hotter Septembers. One long-term solution is making sure your home\u2019s cooling system is up to date. \u201cEspecially if it\u2019s an old system, replacing it might be the better strategy than fixing it,\u201d he said. One way to gauge your cooling system\u2019s efficiency is by looking at your AC unit\u2019s seasonal energy efficiency ratio, or SEER rating. A higher rating indicates lower energy consumption levels and, in turn, lower costs of cooling. Upgrading from a SEER 10 unit to a SEER 14 could cut costs by 20%. But overhauling an existing cooling system can be pricey. That\u2019s why Wolfe encourages getting in touch with your local utility provider and taking advantage of available rebate programs. \u201cSome of these rebate programs are better than others, but they all make a difference. They all want to encourage you to make these improvements,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you buy a high efficiency furnace, if you buy a heat pump, if you install insulation, they provide subsidies to help you do that.\u201d McShane pointed to Con Edison\u2019s own residential rebate programs, which offer New Yorkers living in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Westchester up to $4,000 to get insulation professionally installed. \u201cYou can rail against it, but you can\u2019t stop it. Temperatures are continuing to rise,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cWhat we can do is look at how we use energy and manage it better.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/business/heat-keep-your-power-bill-down/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_success_how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges", "text": "Long before you take your high schooler on college campus tours, consider this: Shopping for college shouldn\u2019t be any different than shopping for a home.\u00a0When you want to buy a home, you come up with a range of how much you can afford and get pre-qualified for a mortgage. Then you look in neighborhoods that offer homes that meet your family\u2019s needs and fall within your price range. \u201cAdopt a mindset that we\u2019re buying college like we\u2019re buying a house,\u201d said Beth Walker, author of \u201cBuying College Better\u201d and \u201cNever Pay Retail for College.\u201d As a financial adviser and certified\u00a0college planning specialist, Walker tries to help families avoid a situation that many find themselves in at the 11th hour: Their child applies \u2014 and gets into \u2014 schools they cannot afford because the schools won\u2019t give them enough aid. And then they just \u2026 try to make it work, no matter how much debt is involved for the parents or the student. Instead, she advises families to start as early as 9th or 10th grade in figuring out what is affordable for them as a family \u2014 so parents don\u2019t sacrifice their own financial welfare and the future college student doesn\u2019t drown in debt upon graduation. And second, she recommends assessing how a child\u2019s talents and interests pare with majors and careers they might want to pursue. Doing both those things can help you target the right colleges to apply to. Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners, defines the perfect college as one \u201cwhere a student can go be happy, safe and successful, graduate in four years or less with a marketable degree and little or no debt.\u201d In helping families align parents\u2019 affordability constraints with their student\u2019s academic and social needs, he cautions them not to automatically assume the Ivys or other high-prestige schools will be best simply because of their status. And he stresses what success in life looks like after college and notes that an Ivy League degree isn\u2019t the only path to achieving it, especially if your child won\u2019t get much aid to attend. In fact, said Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, a lot of brand-name schools don\u2019t even offer merit-based aid, only need-based. So if you\u2019re not rich, but you make too much to qualify for need-based aid, you could find yourself having to cover the entire cost of tuition, room and board every year, which is pushing $90,000 at some US colleges. Set up financial guardrails well before the college search Fothergill created a free calculator called CostHero that lets parents assess what financial resources they will have available to pay for a child\u2019s college education. It then provides a range of affordability: At the low end is the number representing what they can pay if they don\u2019t take on debt. And at the high end is the number they can pay if they also take out an unsubsidized federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). \u201cIf you\u2019re not in a position to write a check for $90,000 a year, put up guardrails for yourself so you don\u2019t blow up your retirement,\u201d he said. The calculator inputs let you set the amount of resources you\u2019re willing to use to pay for college from your income and savings, your child\u2019s earnings from summer jobs, any family gifts, and any federal Stafford loans your child may take. It also factors in if you qualify for the federal American Opportunity Tax Credit. That credit, for qualified educational expenses, will reduce your tax bill or increase any refund you have coming. The calculator also gives you a debt-to-income score like the kind a mortgage lender might use to assess whether you\u2019re a good credit risk. Ideally, he said, you don\u2019t want your housing costs to exceed 36% of your gross income and your total debt \u2014 including debt from housing, cars, credit cards and any parental education loans \u2014 to exceed 43%. If your DTI ratio is close to or higher than 43% that is a sign you could get yourself into trouble if you end up having any financial problems while your child is in college, Fothergill said. \u201cIf folks have a way to determine the range of affordability prior to the onset of the college search, the outcomes are a lot better.\u00a0 For example, if one knows that the range of affordability is between $30,000 [a year] with no parent debt and $50,000 with parent debt, then any college that comes in with a net cost in that range is, by definition, affordable,\u201d Fothergill said. Net cost refers to the true cost of attendance after figuring out how much aid your child may get (e.g., grants and scholarships). Figure out where your student may qualify for the most aid Generally speaking, the biggest tuition discounts go to the most academically accomplished students in an incoming class. \u201cThe student needs to be in the top 25% of those admitted,\u201d Walker said. Getting into that top 25% cohort is based on SAT or ACT scores, and having a high, unweighted GPA based on a rigorous high school curriculum. The curriculum\u2019s academic rigor can be further bolstered by taking AP courses. Since your child is more likely to make the top quartile at some schools than others, Fothergill and Walker both recommend your child focus on applying only to those schools in which they stand the best chances of being in that top group to maximize their chances for merit-based aid. Otherwise, you\u2018ll spend money to apply to guidance-counselor-recommended \u201csafety\u201d schools or \u201creach\u201d schools with no sense if those places are affordable to you should your child get in. Using reported data from admissions officers about their key criteria in admitting an incoming class and based on what more than 1,000 schools report about the qualifications they used to grant aid, Fothergill created another tool called ListHero. It gives students a score that helps gauge\u00a0how competitive their profile is\u00a0at a given school, relative to others admitted, and by extension their eligibility for tuition discounts. Right now the tool is only available to college planning professionals for a fee. But Fothergill plans to create a free mini-version for consumers to use. For parents doing their own research on test scores, GPA requirements, costs and aid, he recommends checking the Department of Education College Scorecard, the site CollegeData.com and the College Board. Other ways to reduce college costs before applying While your children are in high school they can take other steps to reduce the total cost of their education. One way is by doing well on the PSAT to qualify to compete for a National Merit Scholarship. Another is to take AP courses. If their high school doesn\u2019t offer them, there is a program called Freshman Year for Free offered by the Modern States Education Alliance. It provides free AP placement courses and pays the fee for students to take the AP tests or college-level preparation (CLEP) tests administered through the College Board. Getting the minimum AP scores a college requires to earn a college credit will lower how much you ultimately have to spend on tuition. A third option is to see if your state has a program that offers a year of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to a state university from which your child could earn their degree. Or, if you plan to go to any other college, make sure the school will accept the credits from a community college course you plan to take. No matter what steps you take, starting the research and budgeting process early can save everyone a lot of stress, debt and potential heartache in the end. Said Walker: \u201cWe have to be a lot more intentional about this purchase.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/success/how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}

But today, I have some news of my own to share,\u201d Cipri\u00e1n-Matthews announced in a memo to employees. \u201cAfter much consideration, I\u2019ve decided this is the right time to step away from my current role at CBS News and begin to write my next chapter.\u201d The sudden move comes just months before the high stakes 2024 presidential election, leaving the Tiffany Network\u2019s news organization without a top boss to guide it through the pivotal moment. Wendy McMahon, chief executive of CBS News and Stations, said in a separate memo to staffers that Cipri\u00e1n-Matthews will move into a newly created role as senior editorial adviser helping to guide the outlet\u2019s politics coverage during the election. The announcement also comes days after Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS News, accepted an offer from Hollywood production studio Skydance Media that will see the two companies merge. Following the merger, Skydance Media plans to install its own leadership team. Cipri\u00e1n-Matthews alluded to the corporate uncertainty in her memo to staff. \u201cSome may be asking why I\u2019m announcing this now. We all know our industry and company are going through a transformation and a number of short- and long-term decisions need to be made,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI do not want to be disingenuous with any of you about who should drive these decisions. I\u2019ve always leaned into my integrity and my values and I felt it was important to be transparent at this juncture about my plans.\u201d \u201cIngrid will transition into this new role over the next few weeks, and we will share more updates soon,\u201d McMahon said. When she took over as CBS News president, Cipri\u00e1n-Matthews became the first Latina to hold the influential post at the network\u2019s news division. Her short run came after Neeraj Khemlani stepped down after a brief two-year stint, during which he become the subject of a human resources probe. The decision by Cipri\u00e1n-Matthews to vacate her role means that two of the nation\u2019s biggest television broadcast news organizations will be without a chief heading into the November elections amid a particularly turbulent period in the media industry. Earlier this year, Disney ousted Kim Godwin as ABC News chief and has yet to announce a replacement.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/media/cbs-news-president-ingrid-ciprian-matthews-stepping-down/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/11/2024", "section": "business"}}
