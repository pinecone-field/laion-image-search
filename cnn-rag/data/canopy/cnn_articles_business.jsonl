Simons was 86 years old. Simons, the founder of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, helped to pioneer quantitative investing, a market strategy that relies on mathematical and statistical models to identify investing opportunities. Later in life, Simons became a political donor and philanthropist. Simons had a love for math and numbers from an early age, according to his foundation\u2019s website. Born in Newton, Massachusetts, in 1938, Simons earned a mathematics degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a doctorate in math from the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cMathematics was the only subject I liked,\u201d Simons said in a 2015 interview for the Numberphile podcast. After a brief stint teaching at MIT and Harvard University, Simons joined the Institute for Defense Analyses in Princeton, New Jersey, working as a code breaker for the National Security Agency. According to his foundation, Simons was fired from the institute in 1968 due to his opposition to the Vietnam War. Simons then joined the faculty at Stony Brook University as the head of the school\u2019s mathematics department. Simons left the academic world in the late \u201970s, eventually founding Renaissance Technologies in 1982. \u201cIn looking at the patterns of prices, I could see that there was something we could study here and that there were ways to predict prices mathematically and statistically,\u201d Simons said on the Numberphile podcast. \u201cGradually, we built models, and the models got better and better. Finally, the models replaced the fundamental stuff.\u201d Simons\u2019 computer models helped grow his hedge fund into a multi-billion-dollar business. Later in life, Simons devoted his time to philanthropy and became a large Democrat political donor. The Simons Foundation donates to autism research and provides grants for science and math education and research. Last year, Simons\u2019 foundation donated $500 million to Stony Brook\u2019s endowment, the largest unrestricted gift to an American university in history, according to the Simons Foundation. \u201cI joined Stony Brook University in 1968 as chair of their Department of Mathematics,\u201d Simons said at the time. \u201cI knew then it was a top intellectual center with a serious commitment to research and innovation. But Stony Brook also gave me a chance to lead \u2014 and so it has been deeply rewarding to watch the university grow and flourish even more.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/business/jim-simons-dies-renaissance-technologies/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_business_porsche-911-hybrid", "text": "Porsche is set to unveil one of the biggest changes to its signature model. A hybrid Porsche 911, with its gas engine assisted by at least one battery-powered electric motor, will officially be revealed in an online event on May 28. The move is a major step in the evolution of one of the most recognizable sports cars in the world and helps support the acceptance of electric motors across most vehicles. Given their generally greater fuel efficiency without the sacrifice of power, hybrids have become commonplace in many types of vehicles. Porsche itself already sells plug-in hybrid models like the Cayenne e-Hybrid SUV and Panamera e-Hybrid four-door car but a hybrid 911 is another matter. Few cars are as defined by a gasoline engine as the 911 and few automakers are as defined by one model as Porsche is by the 911. While Porsche sells far more SUVs than sports cars these days, the 911 remains the automaker\u2019s core model. Even the Porsche Macan and Cayenne SUVs, with their rounded edges and sloped hoods, have nods in their designs to the 911. Porsche also sells fully electric cars, the Taycan and the new Macan Electric SUV. But executives have said the 911 would be the last Porsche to become all-electric because its engineering is so unique and quintessential to its brand. By taking away the engine in the back \u2014 giving it the distinctive shape and rear-weighted driving feel \u2014 what makes it a 911? This new hybrid model will be the closest Porsche can get to an electric 911 without raising those sorts of philosophical questions. The hybrid 911 has already undergone more than 3 million miles of testing on tracks and public roads in various climates, according to Porsche, but the more practical details won\u2019t be announced until the end of this month. For instance, Porsche would not say whether the car will be a plug-in hybrid, as past and current Porsche hybrids have been. Porsche has favored plug-in hybrids because their more powerful batteries add to performance. But we do know the hybrid 911 is clearly faster than the current purely gas-powered 911. A Porsche test driver was able to take the hybrid around Germany\u2019s famed N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife racetrack in 7 minutes and 17 seconds \u2014 8.7 seconds faster than a comparable current-generation 911. The faster time indicates the hybrid 911 has greater power due to the addition of electric assistance. The N\u00fcrburgring is a twisty, challenging track so the faster time also indicates the car\u2019s handling isn\u2019t hindered by the added weight of batteries and electric motors. \u201cWe have more grip, significantly more power, and the spontaneous response of the performance hybrid is a great advantage,\u201d\u00a0former racing driver and \u201cbrand ambassador\u201d J\u00f6rg Bergmeister said in a statement. The announcement of the new hybrid version comes about 60 years after Porsche launched the 911. The first 911 was unveiled in 1963 but didn\u2019t go into production until 1964. It was a larger and more powerful addition to Porsche\u2019s original model \u2014 the 356. Both models, which were produced together for only a few years, had small back seats and engines mounted behind the rear wheels. The layout was similar to the Volkswagen Beetle, a car designed by Ferdinand Porsche Sr., the father of Ferdinand \u201cFerry\u201d Porsche, who created the 356. Ferry\u2019s son, Ferdinand \u201cButzi\u201d Porsche, worked on the design of the 911, modeled after the 356\u2019s teardrop shape. Its form, including the increasingly cramped backseats, has remained fundamentally the same since the original model.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/business/porsche-911-hybrid/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_investing_premarket-stocks-trading", "text": "A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business\u2019 Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Like it or not, most business leaders, analysts and economists agree that artificial intelligence will play an outsized role in shaping the future of the US economy. The next few years will be critical in defining the shape of the AI revolution, and economist and former dean of Columbia Business School Glenn Hubbard is worried the United States isn\u2019t ready to accept the disruptions that come along with it. Before the Bell spoke with Hubbard about what he sees as an increasingly dangerous problem that could stifle growth for years to come. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Why is this the right time to refocus on AI and economic growth? Growth is always the right answer. Anything we want to do as a society \u2014 if we want to fight climate change, if we want to rebuild our military, want to educate and train people \u2014 it\u2019s all about economic growth. So how come politicians aren\u2019t talking about this? Imagine I have a coin in my hand. The head side is growth, and we all think that\u2019s great. But the tail side is disruption. Economists believe that you can\u2019t have growth without disruption. And since our political class doesn\u2019t know how to handle disruption, they\u2019ve stopped talking about growth. A better idea might be to handle disruption \u2014 actually help people get trained, get educated, help communities, and yet that\u2019s disappeared off the radar screen. The fact that we are interested in growth is hardly a surprise. The big surprise is why we don\u2019t talk about it. I think the answer is that it\u2019s just hard for politicians. When you talk about disruption, are you talking about the job losses that will come with greater use of artificial intelligence? Think of two waves. Over the past three or four decades, technological change and some globalization has caused a slow-mo disruption of the job market and communities around the country. Now look at AI, we\u2019re going to have that same disruption except it\u2019s going to be much faster. We\u2019re talking about five years, not 30. And if we couldn\u2019t even handle the slow-mo, 30-year process, how are we going to do it in five? We really need to rethink how we manage change. Because of course we want the change from AI. The question is, how do you help people cope? Major CEOs are already talking about how they\u2019re implementing AI in their own businesses. Do we really need government help and intervention? I think it does require some government help because companies will certainly do what\u2019s in their own interest, which would be to become more efficient or use AI to revolutionize processes, but it\u2019s not up to me as a company to prepare my workers for another kind of job. That\u2019s just not my interest. So you do need public policy. I do think it\u2019s simple and we kind of know how to do this. It\u2019s arming community colleges, it\u2019s public-private partnerships between businesses and community colleges. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t know what to do, but we need to do it. And of course, it\u2019s not going to be free either, the government would have to spend some money. A lot of people would argue that the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act have done a lot to increase spending and stimulate growth\u2026\u00a0 I would have gone higher and lower. The real role for government is massive support for basic research that could lead to the next generation of chips. The question is not about today, it\u2019s really about tomorrow. We\u2019re way underspending on R&D, and research is a lot better than writing checks to companies that already have a lot of money. We also need to target things we think are critical for national defense and protect those things. But we don\u2019t have a checkbook big enough to subsidize everything, that\u2019s not going to be the road to recovery. So we either need to go up and support research or go down and try to find narrow pockets to subsidize. Both the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act have good headings and leads, but below that there\u2019s a lot of waste. Inflation is still above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. Wouldn\u2019t prioritizing economic growth exacerbate the problem? Most of what I\u2019m suggesting isn\u2019t going to be a huge demand stimulus. It\u2019s more about supply side productivity, so a little bit less of a concern. But it is still the case that you don\u2019t want to keep expanding the deficit. Policymakers would need to make choices: You could raise some taxes or you cut some other spending. A massive tax hike isn\u2019t likely to happen during an election year\u2026 Yeah, I\u2019m not expecting any candidate to suggest that right now. But it\u2019s really an arithmetic problem. Payments on the national debt, which were essentially zero a couple of years ago, are now as big as defense spending. And so we really have to think this through and the next president is going to have to deal with it. He may not be campaigning on it, but whoever he is, he\u2019s going to have to do something about it. How does moving the focus away from growth hurt Americans\u2019 economic prospects?\u00a0 It will slow down productivity growth. Generative AI will probably be the biggest driver of productivity growth in the next decade or two, not so much because it\u2019s replacing jobs but it\u2019s adding to the productivity of a person. But it also means that we have to be willing to tolerate the fact that some firms will go out of business, some people will lose their jobs and other firms will get very big. Are we willing to do all those things? I would say fine, but I\u2019m not sure our political process is willing to do that. What will the long-term consequences be if the current trend continues?\u00a0 Social support for our system is unraveling and it\u2019s been unraveling for a while. There are many communities and many groups of individuals who don\u2019t really feel like contemporary capitalism is serving them well. And the longer we let that go, we\u2019re really running the risk of killing the golden goose. I don\u2019t even see why this would be unpopular. If I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to have a block grant for communities. I\u2019m going to boost community colleges,\u201d why is that bad? If I\u2019m a governor, I love it. If I\u2019m a mayor, I\u2019m loving it. I can\u2019t quite figure out why we can\u2019t get it done.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

The British bank said in a report Wednesday that it expects nearly 1.2 million Swifties to attend the superstar\u2019s shows in the UK this summer, with the typical fan expected to spend \u00a3642 ($810) on travel, accommodation and other expenses \u2014 injecting a total of \u00a3755 million ($953 million) into the economy. It is just the latest example of \u201cSwiftonomics\u201d \u2014 the musician\u2019s ability to influence the economies of the cities and countries that she visits on her mammoth global tour, which kicked off in March last year in the United States. Fans are likely to fork out \u00a3121 ($153) for accommodation, \u00a3111 ($140) for travel and \u00a359 ($74) in restaurants around the venues, according to Barclays, which based its estimates on customer transaction data and proprietary consumer research. Swift will perform 15 shows across four UK cities in England, Wales and Scotland in June and August. The concerts sold out within minutes of tickets going on sale, with fans spending \u00a3206 ($260) on average on a single ticket, Barclays said. Including the ticket price, UK concertgoers will spend, on average, \u00a3848 ($1,068) each, which is more than 12 times the average cost of a night out in the UK, according to Barclays\u2019 research. While the price tag may seem hefty, it\u2019s much less than many Americans will pay to see the \u201cEras Tour\u201d back home. And it is well worth it for Swifties, says Dr Peter Brooks, chief behavioral scientist at Barclays. \u201cWhen it comes to cultural icons like Taylor Swift \u2014 like we saw with Elvis and Beatlemania in the 50s and 60s \u2014 supporters have such a strong connection to the artist and to the rest of the fandom that the desire to spend becomes even more powerful,\u201d Brooks wrote in the report. \u201cFor \u2018Eras Tour\u2019 ticketholders, every pound they spend is an investment in the memories they\u2019ll create,\u201d he added. Many Swifties are prepared to go to even greater lengths to see their idol live. Almost a fifth of Swift\u2019s fans in the UK who responded to a survey commissioned by Barclays last month said they planned to travel to mainland Europe to see the singer perform. That\u2019s \u201cpossibly due to ticket availability, cheaper travel and accommodation costs, or simply so that (fans) can combine the concert with (a) holiday or city break,\u201d the bank wrote in its report. The European leg of the \u201cEras Tour\u201d includes concerts in Sweden, Portugal, Spain, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Poland and Austria this year. Some of Swift\u2019s American fans are also choosing to travel overseas to see her perform. Even with flights and accommodation expenses factored in, the overall cost of attending one of Swift\u2019s shows in Europe is often lower than in the United States, where ticket prices are much higher.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/business/taylor-swift-uk-tour-one-billion-boost-economy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said.

But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_media_google-gemini-ai-search-news-outlet-impact", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. The A.I. doomsday clock appears ready to strike midnight for publishers. Google\u00a0on Tuesday announced that it will infuse its ubiquitous search engine with its powerful artificial intelligence model,\u00a0Gemini, drawing on the rapidly advancing technology to directly answer user queries at the top of results pages. \u201cGoogle will do the Googling for you,\u201d the company explained. In other words, users will soon no longer have to click on the links displayed in search results to find the information they are seeking. On its surface that might sound convenient, but for news publishers \u2014 many of whom are already struggling with steep traffic declines \u2014 the revamped search experience will likely cause an even\u00a0further\u00a0decrease in audience, potentially starving them of readers and revenue. Why spend time clicking on a link when Google has already scoured the internet and harvested the relevant information with its A.I.? \u201cGoogle will take care of the legwork,\u201d executives said. But a lot of that legwork, of course, comes in the form of human-written articles and expertise published across the internet on blogs and media outlets, all built on a foundation of advertising support. Google\u2019s message was heard loud and clear. Within hours of the Mountain View announcement, the news industry began sounding the alarm. \u201cThis will be catastrophic to our traffic, as marketed by Google to further satisfy user queries, leaving even less incentive to click through so that we can monetize our content,\u201d\u00a0Danielle Coffey, the chief executive of the\u00a0News/Media Alliance, bluntly told CNN. Coffey, whose organization represents more than 2,000 news publishers and has taken an aggressive posture toward A.I. developers\u2019 use of journalism, added: \u201cThe little traffic we get today will be further diminished, and with a dominant search engine that\u2019s cementing its market power, we once again have to adhere to their terms. This time with a product that directly competes with our content, using our content to fuel it. This is a perverse twist on \u2018innovation.\u2019\u201d The announcement from Google, which newsrooms had expected and expressed worry over in both public and private forums in recent months, is poised to further batter an industry that has been dealt a series of brutal blows \u2014\u00a0much of it at the hands of Big Tech\u00a0\u2014 over the last several years. It also comes as\u00a0OpenAI\u00a0reportedly readies to launch its own A.I.-powered search engine. Since\u00a0ChatGPT\u00a0crashed onto the scene more than a year ago, showcasing the potential power of A.I. for the public and setting off an arms race with Google,\u00a0Meta\u00a0and others, publishers have worried greatly about the impact the technology will ultimately have on their businesses. But they have had little time to plan their responses to the transformative technology, given the breakneck pace in which it has developed. Some newsrooms have chosen to cautiously lock arms with the technology giants, striking deals with OpenAI to license their deep archives of content. Others have taken a much different path, with\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0most notably filing a scorched Earth lawsuit against the ChatGPT creator. While publishers once worked hand-in hand with Big Tech companies (remember those days?), their relationships have soured tremendously in recent years.\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg\u00a0most publicly turned his back on the news industry, deprioritizing news articles on his platforms and shutting off other initiatives his company once championed. Google has maintained a better relationship with publishers but also faced sharp criticism. Most recently, it\u00a0drew scorn\u00a0after temporarily blocking some California news outlets from search results in response to a bill that would force it to pay publishers. On Tuesday, likely predicting the panic that its announcement would stir, Google argued that the A.I. changes would actually benefit news companies. Google told CNN it is showing more links with its AI Overviews feature and that by improving the search product, it will allow the company to send more traffic to web publishers. \u201cWe see that the links included in AI Overviews get more clicks than if the page had appeared as a traditional web listing for that query,\u201d Google said in its announcement. \u201cAs we expand this experience, we\u2019ll continue to focus on sending valuable traffic to publishers and creators.\u201d But given Silicon Valley\u2019s track record with publishers, it\u2019s unlikely that the statement will give them much relief. And already there is skepticism over Google\u2019s claims. \u201cOur initial analysis suggests it will significantly reduce search traffic to content creators\u2019 websites, directly impacting their ad revenue and, by extension, their livelihoods,\u201d\u00a0Marc McCollum, chief innovation officer at\u00a0Raptive, which provides services to thousands of only creators and businesses,\u00a0said in a statement. \u201cThis change could put the future of the open internet in danger.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/media/google-gemini-ai-search-news-outlet-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

This week, Xi is welcoming him to China for a two-day state visit \u2014 their fourth in-person meeting since Russia\u2019s onslaught in Ukraine began. The war has driven the two leaders and their economies closer together \u2014 with trade hitting record levels last year as Russia upped its imports of key commodities from China and Chinese buyers lapped up discounted Russian fuel. The United States has said Chinese exports of products like machine tools and microelectronics are enabling Russia to bolster the defense industrial base powering its war in Ukraine, and official data show hefty increases of related goods that are consistent with those claims. China has repeatedly\u00a0defended its trade\u00a0with Russia as part of normal bilateral relations. It also says it maintains a neutral position on the war and plays no other role than seeking peace. Here\u2019s how the two sides have upgraded their ties since February 2022. Sanctions\u00a0drive economies closer The European Union, the US and many of its allies and others across the world have imposed a range of sanctions targeting Russian entities and the flow of goods to and from the warring country. Those have included efforts to limit its revenue from key exports like fuel, as well as its access to technologies and goods with military applications. Despite these efforts to isolate Putin\u2019s government and reduce its war coffers, Russia\u2019s economy blew past expectations to grow by 3.6% in 2023, according to data from the International Monetary Fund. That followed a contraction in 2022, according to Russian state media. The sanctions have caused a sweeping shift in who Russia trades with \u2014 and China has emerged as a key economic lifeline, greatly expanding trade ties with its northern neighbor.\u00a0The two countries last year racked up $240 billion in bilateral trade, hitting a target to exceed $200 billion in two-way trade by 2024 ahead of schedule \u2014 a feat lauded by both Putin and Xi. That\u2019s driven China to rank as Russia\u2019s top trade partner, Putin declared last year, with his presidential aide later confirming to Russian state media that the country\u00a0had surpassed the EU to take that spot. As the EU slashed purchases of Russian fuel and limited exports ranging from high-tech goods to transportation equipment, China bolstered its own exports of\u00a0industrial and commercial goods to the country, such as vehicles, machinery and home appliances, data and official statements show. Russia has also become China\u2019s main oil supplier, overtaking Saudi Arabia, according to official Chinese trade data. China, however, is not alone in taking advantage of Russia\u2019s need to find new markets for its fuel, with India also among buyers upping imports in the wake of the war. Governments warn against support for Russia\u2019s war effort The wartime surge in trade, and growing purchases of oil, have sparked criticism in the West that China was helping to fund Russia\u2019s war. Western governments and independent analysts also raised alarm that dual-use goods with potential military applications are part of these surging imports. White House officials in recent weeks have confronted China on what they believe is Beijing\u2019s substantial support for Russia\u2019s defense industrial base, including through exports like semiconductors, materials and machine tools they say are enabling Russia to ramp up production of tanks, munitions and armored vehicles. In a visit to Beijing late last month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Chinese leaders that the US and other countries would act if Beijing didn\u2019t move to stem this flow. French President Emmanuel Macron and his European Commission counterpart Ursula von der Leyen also pressed Xi on such supplies during the leader\u2019s state visit to France last week, with Von der Leyen saying after the meeting that \u201cmore effort is needed to curtail delivery of dual-use goods to Russia that find their way to the battlefield.\u201d Beijing has previously slammed the US as making \u201cgroundless accusations\u201d over \u201cnormal trade and economic exchanges\u201d between China and Russia. But analysts have pointed to nascent, potential signs that China may be seeking to dial down such imports \u2014 with China\u2019s monthly exports to Russia declining in both March and April compared with the same periods in 2023, according to official Chinese customs data. Putin and Xi\u2019s high-level friendship Xi and Putin\u2019s relationship has also appeared to strengthen as both leaders consolidated power,\u00a0rewriting\u00a0previous term limits in recent years to extend their\u00a0respective lengthy rules. The war has not changed that dynamic. Putin\u2019s overseas travel has declined since the outbreak of the conflict, but this trip marks his second to China since the invasion and the two leaders\u2019 fourth in-person meeting in that time. Xi has made a single known phone call to Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky during that period and met US President Joe Biden in person twice on the sidelines of international summits since Biden took office in 2021. Xi and Putin have a history of marking milestones together. This week\u2019s visit is Putin\u2019s symbolic first international visit since his victory in a tightly controlled election in March. It mirrors Xi\u2019s state visit to Russia in March 2023, which was the Chinese leader\u2019s first overseas trip after starting a norm-shattering third term as president.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/business/china-russia-ties-ukraine-war-intl-hnk-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_investing_gamestop-short-sellers-nightcap", "text": "The only bet riskier than buying meme stocks like GameStop may be cheering for their decline. That\u2019s the lesson Wall Street\u2019s short-sellers are learning the hard way this week. See here: For the first four months of the year, GameStop short-sellers \u2014 investors who bet on a stock\u2019s decline \u2014 were sitting on $392 million in gains, up nearly 50%. But with this week\u2019s surge, those gains have vanished and left shorts with more than $1.2 billion in paper losses, according to research from S3 Partners. Nearly $1 billion of that was wiped out Monday alone. To understand the meme stock phenomenon, it helps to understand a bit of the tribalism underpinning it. When meme stocks first emerged in 2021, the day traders running up the price of GameStop weren\u2019t a bunch of anti-establishment marauders attacking Wall Street generally \u2014 they were going for the short-sellers, regarded by many, from retail investors to CEOs like Elon Musk, to be the most reviled traders in finance. After all, no one likes the guy who gets rich off of others\u2019 failings. (Short-sellers argue, however, that they play an important role in preventing market bubbles.) Disgust for short-sellers fueled GameStop\u2019s 2,000% surge that ultimately squeezed firms like Citron Research to retire from the short-selling game and, a year later, forced the hedge fund Melvin Capital to fold entirely. The Reddit community that originated the frenzy, WallStreetBets, preached an us-vs.-them investing style, often using profane language and memes to paint the short-sellers as the enemy. If you were one of the Apes (as the day traders called themselves), inflicting financial pain on the shorts was just as important, if not more important, than lining your own pockets. Meme mania 2.0? Although the meme fever is rising this week \u2014 set off by a single, wordless social media post by the GameStop stock guru RoaringKitty \u2014 we\u2019re unlikely to see a repeat of the frenzy that gripped Wall Street three years ago. At that time, GameStop\u2019s \u201cshort interest,\u201d aka the number of shares sold short relative to its total public float, was a staggering 140%, meaning some shares had been shorted more than once. Today, short interest is just 24% \u2014 firmly in negative sentiment territory, but nowhere near the absurd levels of January 2021. Today\u2019s GameStop shorts aren\u2019t likely to hang on and repeat the mistakes of their Melvin Capital brethren. Then again, shorts and their meme-pushing long-positioned enemies share a reputation for relentlessness. Looking at the fundamentals of GameStop \u2014 a mall-based retailer that\u2019s burning through cash and has already slashed expenses to stay in business \u2014 it\u2019s easy to understand why folks are wagering that it\u2019s on the decline. \u201cBuy to cover\u201d trades will force a lot of shorts out of their positions and push GameStop\u2019s stock price higher than the day traders could on their own, wrote Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, in a note Tuesday. \u201cBut there will also be new short sellers entering the ring, with GME\u2019s stock price over $30 being an attractive entry point.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/investing/gamestop-short-sellers-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

A retirement savings crisis may be looming in the United States but it doesn\u2019t appear to be forcing people to consider working full-time into their old age. By the end of the decade, about 21% of the population will be 65 or older, up from 15% in 2016, according to forecasts by the Census Bureau. Most non-retired adults have some type of retirement savings, but only 36% think their savings are on track. New research from economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York finds that this retirement savings deficit hasn\u2019t made a dent in when Americans plan to exit, or partially exit, the workforce. In fact, researchers found that since the pandemic, workers have reported much lower expectations of working full-time beyond ages 62 and 67 (the latter is the retirement age for full Social Security benefits). Surprisingly, they found that the decline is particularly notable for lower-income and female workers. What\u2019s happening: The pandemic ushered in the great resignation. Almost 50 million people quit their job in the two years following the worst of Covid-19, citing pressures such as burnout, general job dissatisfaction or child care or elder care needs. Amid a tight labor market, many were also able to find a better job, with better pay. The trend was so prevalent that Beyonc\u00e9 even released a song about it. But even though the pandemic is over, and the US economy has recovered quickly from the 2020 recession, the labor force is still experiencing unprecedented changes, report New York Fed economists Felix Aidala, Gizem Kosar and Wilbert van der Klaauw. Looking at the Survey of Consumer Expectations\u2019 (SCE) triannual Labor Market Survey, the economists found that beginning in March 2020, retirement-age full-time employment expectations began to plunge and have persistently declined since. The survey hit an all-time low in March 2024, when just 45.8% of respondents said that they planned to work full-time beyond the age of 62. Those expectations averaged 54.6% in the six years before the pandemic. \u201cThe decline is broad-based across age, education, and income groups, with workers under age 45, without a college degree, and with annual household incomes below $60,000 showing slightly larger declines than their peers,\u201d wrote the researchers. What it means: While the great resignation has ended and wage growth is easing, the New York Fed\u2019s survey responses still \u201creveal a persistent decline in expectations of working full-time beyond ages 62 and 67,\u201d said the economists. They\u2019re not sure what\u2019s behind the phenomenon and they said they were surprised by the results given increases in life expectancy. There could be a litany of explanations, many due to post-pandemic cultural shifts about the value of work and an increase in savings during the pandemic. Either way, it could be significant for the economy. \u201cThe pandemic-induced change in retirement expectations may continue to affect the labor market in years to come,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt also can have important macroeconomic implications when consumers act on their expectations in making consumption and saving decisions.\u201d It could also have serious implications for the timing of claims for Social Security benefits. Social Security payments still provide\u00a0about 90% of income\u00a0for 12% of older men and 15% of older women, according to Social Security Agency surveys. But without intervention, the Social Security trust fund\u00a0will be depleted\u00a0by the mid-2030s, meaning that only a portion of retirees\u2019 expected benefits will be paid out. Lawmakers have faced a decades-long political stalemate on how to fix it. Yes, but: This is a survey of expectations, researchers at the New York Fed are quick to point out. Just because Americans say they plan to shift to part-time work or retire early, it doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ll be able to. Debt \u2014 and delinquencies \u2014 are on the rise for Americans The\u00a0economy has been resilient, the\u00a0job market healthy\u00a0and\u00a0consumers keep spending, but more Americans are becoming financially overextended \u2014 especially on their credit cards, reports my colleague Alicia Wallace. New data released Tuesday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed that as household debt balances grew during the first quarter, delinquencies also marched higher. Notably, the percentage of credit card balances in serious delinquency (90 days or more late) climbed to its highest level since 2012. \u201cIn the first quarter of 2024, credit card and auto loan transition rates into serious delinquency continued to rise across all age groups,\u201d Joelle Scally, regional economic principal within the Household and Public Policy Research Division at the New York Fed, said in a statement. \u201cAn increasing number of borrowers missed credit card payments, revealing worsening financial distress among some households.\u201d Aggregate delinquency rates increased during the first quarter to 3.2% of outstanding debt in some stage of delinquency, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2020, according to the New York Fed\u2019s latest Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit. The transitions into delinquency \u2014 especially serious delinquency \u2014 increased across all debt types, according to the report. Walmart is cutting hundreds of corporate jobs Walmart said Tuesday it is eliminating several hundred corporate jobs and will relocate most of its remaining remote office staff to its Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters, reports CNN\u2019s Parija Kavilanz. Walmart confirmed the move in a memo sent by Donna Morris, its chief people officer, to employees on Tuesday and obtained by CNN. Morris, in the memo, said the decision to relocate employees and ask other remote staff to come back into the office was made to facilitate better collaboration, innovation \u201cand move even faster.\u201d \u201cWe also believe it helps strengthen our culture as well as grow and develop our associates,\u201d she said in the memo. The relocation will impact the majority of workers in Walmart\u2019s Dallas, Atlanta and Toronto offices. While most relocations will be to its Bentonville headquarters, some workers will be relocated to Walmart offices in the San Francisco Bay Area or to Hoboken, New Jersey, and the New York area. \u201cIn addition, some parts of our business have made changes that will result in a reduction of several hundred campus roles,\u201d Morris said in the memo. \u201cWhile the overall numbers are small in percentage, we are focused on supporting each of our associates affected by these changes.\u201d Walmart\u00a0is expected to report its latest quarterly earnings on Thursday.

{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

It will let the court know by July 7 how it will proceed with the case. Boeing, in a statement, said it has upheld its end of the bargain. \u201cWe believe that we have honored the terms of that agreement, and look forward to the opportunity to respond to the Department on this issue,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cAs we do so, we will engage with the Department with the utmost transparency, as we have throughout the entire term of the agreement.\u201d The notification comes as the Justice Department conducts a new investigation into Boeing\u2019s operations in the wake the door plug incident. The earlier deal had resolved a fraud investigation related to the company\u2019s development of its 737 Max aircraft. Under its deferred prosecution agreement from January 2021, Boeing paid $2.5 billion in penalties and promised to improve its safety and compliance protocols. Families of victims of the October 2018 Lion Air 737 Max crash and the March 2019 Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crash had long denounced the delayed prosecution agreement, arguing it denied them justice for the deaths of their loved ones. Families of victims and lawyers representing them met with the Justice Department late last month to persuade the Biden administration to end the agreement in light of multiple safety lapses at Boeing this year and in past years after the 2021 agreement was reached. Following the April 2024 meeting, attorney Paul Cassell, who represents the victims\u2019 families, said at a press conference that the deferred prosecution agreement was \u201crigged\u201d and brokered without families\u2019 say. Cassell pledged to hold Boeing accountable for its \u201cfraud and misconduct.\u201d On Tuesday, Cassell said, \u201cThis is a positive first step, and for the families, a long time coming. But we need to see further action from DOJ to hold Boeing accountable, and plan to use our meeting on May 31 to explain in more detail what we believe would be a satisfactory remedy to Boeing\u2019s ongoing criminal conduct.\u201d The Justice Department in its letter said it notified the families that Boeing breached its agreement, and it will continue to confer with families of the crash victims as well as other airline customers about next steps. The Department of Justice plans to meet with the families next on May 31. In Thursday\u2019s letter to the federal judge overseeing the prior agreement, the Justice Department said it had notified the company that \u201cthe government has determined that Boeing breached its obligations\u201d in multiple parts of the 2021 deal \u201cby failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the U.S. fraud laws throughout its operations.\u201d Boeing safety issues following its agreement Despite pledging to clean up its act, Boeing had a seemingly endless run of quality and safety lapses in the years since its deferred prosecution agreement. On September 20, 2021, just months after its agreement, Boeing disclosed it found\u00a0empty tequila bottles\u00a0inside one of the two 747 jets being refurbished for use as the next generation of Air Force One. In April 2023, Boeing announced its supplier used a \u201cnon-standard manufacturing process,\u201d delaying deliveries of the 737 Max. In February 2024, a month after the door plug incident, a preliminary National Transportation Safety Board investigation found that the plane left a Boeing factory missing the four bolts needed to secure the door plug. Later that month, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a report sharply\u00a0critical of the culture\u00a0at Boeing, citing \u201cgaps in Boeing\u2019s safety journey,\u201d and gave Boeing 90 days\u00a0to come up with a plan to fix its problems. Subsequent FAA reports found multiple problems\u00a0with Boeing\u2019s production practices following a six-week audit. In March, the FAA identified more\u00a0potential safety issues\u00a0with the engines of the 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner. Last month, the FAA announced an investigation into\u00a0a whistleblower\u2019s complaint\u00a0that the company took shortcuts when manufacturing its 777 and 787 Dreamliner jets and that those risks could become catastrophic as the airplanes age. The company disputed the complaint.

The rideshare company on Wednesday announced the launch of Uber Shuttle, an offering that will let users book up to five seats in a shuttle from a central location to an event or the airport \u2013 for less than the cost of a regular Uber ride. The cost of the shuttle rides won\u2019t be affected by surge pricing, a common affliction when lots of people are looking for rides at the same time. Riders can book their space on the shuttles, which will hold between 14 and 55 seats, up to a week in advance and will receive a QR code ticket to board. Uber plans to partner with local shuttle companies with commercially licensed drivers to facilitate the offering, but users will be able to rate and tip drivers within the Uber app like with any other ride. Uber has previously rolled out early shuttle tests, including in India, and as an offering for corporate customers. The feature will roll out to US consumers this summer for event venues in select cities, including Chicago, Pittsburgh, Charlotte and Miami, with plans to expand more broadly in the coming months. The Uber Shuttle announcement was one of several new features announced at the company\u2019s annual product update Wednesday, which also include a discounted Uber One membership program for students and the ability for Uber Eats users to order from Costco even if they don\u2019t have a membership for the big box retailer. Taken together, the announcements are designed to give people even more reasons to use its products, while focusing on affordability with group rides and other discounted offerings. The strategy comes at a time when consumers are pulling back on spending in the face of higher prices for a range of goods, from groceries to clothing. The diversification of Uber\u2019s business beyond traditional ride hailing has also helped it maintain its leadership position over rival Lyft. \u201cThe simple act of sharing, whether it\u2019s rides or groceries, makes your every day just a little bit cheaper,\u201d Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said at the company\u2019s Wednesday product event in New York City. Also among Uber\u2019s Wednesday announcements is a feature designed for caregivers, which will let them book rides, order groceries and purchase medical supplies and other over-the-counter items for loved ones. In certain cases, the person receiving care\u2019s medical benefits can be applied to cover the rides and orders, and a three-way chat will let the caregiver, rider and driver communicate together. (The feature builds upon a similar offering that lets healthcare providers book rides for patients.) Uber will also let riders pre-book shared rides \u2014 the evolution of what used to be called Uber Pool, where riders can split a ride with strangers going in a similar direction \u2014 for a discount, a move it says was inspired by growth in people using the app during commuting hours. The feature will initially launch in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, San Diego and Atlanta, before expanding to other areas. \u201cSharing is an essential part of the future of cities at our scale,\u201d Camiel Irving, general manager of US and Canada mobility operations, said Wednesday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/tech/uber-shuttle-airport-concert-annual-product-update/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_economy_us-retail-sales-april", "text": "US consumers could be reaching their breaking point. After dealing with elevated inflation and the highest interest rates in decades, they\u2019re starting to rein in their spending. Last month, retail sales were unchanged from March, when spending increased by a downwardly revised 0.6%, the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday. April spending missed the 0.4% increase that economists had projected, according to FactSet. The figures are adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation. By comparison, a year ago, retail sales surged by 3%. Stripping away auto sales, April retail sales were up by 0.2% last month, matching economists\u2019 expectations. By sector, the biggest monthly increase in spending was at gas stations, where sales were up 3.1% in April compared to March. That\u2019s likely a result of surging gas prices experienced in the previous two months. However, they\u2019ve started to cool in recent weeks. Spending was also higher at clothing and accessory stores (+1.6%), food and beverage stores (+0.8%) as well as at restaurants and bars (+0.2%). Almost all other sectors saw monthly declines in spending. The biggest decline was online retail sales, which fell by 1.2% last month. That\u2019s a significant development given online sales have been a bright spot in prior months. Separately, new inflation figures released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed some improvement. The nation\u2019s annual inflation rate eased from 3.5% in March to 3.4% in April, in line with expectations. That came after March\u2019s unexpected jump in inflation. Both pieces of data are welcome news for Federal Reserve officials: Central bankers have been looking for signs that inflation will return back to the Fed\u2019s 2% target. Financially stressed consumers are ushering in an economic slowdown Wednesday\u2019s retail report is another piece of evidence that the economy is slowing. That\u2019s good in the sense that it doesn\u2019t give retailers the ability to pass along higher prices to consumers if they aren\u2019t willing to accept them, which had previously been the case. \u201cBut if that transitions into a deeper slowdown it could herald some economic problems that markets would not welcome,\u201d Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in a note on Wednesday. For the time being though, she said the retail sales report gives the Fed more of a reason to ponder cutting interest rates at upcoming meetings. Many economists now feel that the Fed could cut interest rates as soon as September. The much weaker-than-expected retail sales data comes as the nation\u2019s unemployment rate ticked up last month to 3.9% as the pace of hiring slowed. Also, the number of people applying for first-time unemployment benefits recently rose to the highest level since August. The weakening labor market is causing consumers to act with \u201cmore prudence,\u201d EY senior economist Lydia Boussour said in a note Wednesday. Consumers are also taking on a lot more debt to support their spending but increasingly aren\u2019t making payments on time, according to data released earlier this week by the New York Fed. Notably, the percentage of credit card balances in serious delinquency (90 days or more late) climbed to its highest level since 2012.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/economy/us-retail-sales-april/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

The season opener between the Indiana Fever and Connecticut Sun drew an average of 2.1 million viewers on ESPN2, ESPN+ and Disney+, making it the most watched WNBA game in more than two decades. The matchup also marked the first time Disney+ has streamed a live sports game, peaking with an average of 2.3 million viewers, ESPN said. The game, which saw the Sun outshine the Fever in a 92-71 victory, drew the largest WNBA audience since the Los Angeles Sparks and Houston Comets faced off in 2001, according to Sports Illustrated.

{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_business_sunspots-disrupt-phones-gps-scn", "text": "Buckle up: An unusual amount of solar activity this week could disrupt some of the most important technologies society relies on. On Thursday, the US government issued its first severe geomagnetic storm watch in nearly 20 years, advising the public of \u201cat least five earth-directed coronal mass ejections\u201d as well as sunspots\u00a0covering an area 16 times wider than the earth itself. A severe geomagnetic storm, or G4, is the second-highest grade in the US government\u2019s classification system. Radiation from this activity began to hit the earth\u2019s magnetic field on Friday and will last through the weekend, said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). On Friday evening, NOAA upgraded the storm to G5 or \u201cextreme,\u201d marking the first such event since October 2003. NOAA\u2019s warning of extreme space weather suggests the storm could trigger numerous effects for life on earth, possibly affecting the power grid as well as satellite and high frequency radio communications. Here\u2019s what that means for technology users. Communications impacts The solar activity NOAA\u2019s talking about involves the release of energy from the sun that travels through space and eventually reaches Earth. When that radiation hits the magnetic sphere surrounding the planet, it causes fluctuations in the ionosphere, a layer of the upper atmosphere. Those changes can directly affect satellites and other spacecraft in orbit, altering their orientation or potentially knocking out their electronics. Moreover, the changes to the ionosphere can block or degrade radio transmissions trying to pass through the atmosphere to reach satellites. And they can also prevent radio transmissions from successfully bouncing off the ionosphere \u2014 which some radio operators normally do to increase the range of their signals. Since GPS satellites depend on signals penetrating the ionosphere, the geomagnetic disturbance scientists are expecting could affect that critical technology used by planes, ocean-going vessels, and in the agriculture and oil and gas industries. And it could affect shortwave radio transmissions used by ships and aircraft, emergency management agencies, the military and even ham radio operators, all of whom rely on the high frequency radio airwaves that NOAA says could be scattered by the storm. \u201cGeomagnetic storms can impact infrastructure in near-Earth orbit and on Earth\u2019s surface, potentially disrupting communications, the electric power grid, navigation, radio and satellite operations,\u201d NOAA\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center said in a release. \u201cSWPC has notified the operators of these systems so they can take protective action.\u201d What about your cellphone? Consumer wireless networks rely on different radio frequencies than the high frequency band, so it appears unlikely that the storm will directly affect cellular service. The GPS features on your phone also typically use a mix of pure GPS and cellular tower-based location tracking, so even if GPS signals are disrupted, phone users may still be able to maintain a rough location fix. So long as the underlying electrical infrastructure that supports wireless networks remains unaffected, even an extreme space weather event should result in \u201cminimal direct impact to public safety line of-sight radio and commercial cellular services \u2026 and no first-order impact to consumer electronic devices,\u201d according to researchers summarizing the findings of a 2010 study of extreme space weather conducted by NOAA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency outlined a similar report in a 2021 presentation on space weather, finding that line-of-sight radio transmissions are generally not affected by space weather except in specific situations. The presentation did note some risks for copper cables and telephone lines based on land. In a slightly different scenario in February, NOAA noted two major solar flares. But despite \u201cwidely reported cellular network outages\u201d around the same time, the agency said, it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that the flares played a role\u00a0in\u00a0those blackouts. On Friday, NOAA officials reiterated that the impact to cell phones this weekend should be slim to none, unless there are broad disruptions to the power grid. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen any evidence in the past that a space weather storm could impact that now,\u201d Brent Gordon, chief of the Space Weather Services branch for SWPC, told reporters on a conference call. \u201cIf power is not available for those, then yes, certainly, the secondary impacts from that would be great.\u201d The power grid is potentially at risk Severe space weather can jeopardize power grids, according to NOAA, whose alert this week said to expect \u201cpossible widespread voltage control problems\u201d and that \u201csome protective systems may mistakenly trip out key assets from the power grid.\u201d In 1989, a space weather event led to a massive blackout in Quebec, Canada for more than nine hours after geomagnetic fluctuations damaged transformers and other important equipment. In October, an extreme geomagnetic storm stronger than the one predicted for this weekend led to power outages in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa, the SWPC said. The largest known geomagnetic storm in history, known as the Carrington Event of 1859, caused telegraph stations to spark and catch fire. A blackout of the electrical grid could have cascading effects for communications and other technologies, including cellphones. Cellular towers might lose power, as could the data centers that host websites and their information. Still, many wireless carriers providers already maintain backup power generators and mobile cellular towers that they can deploy in the event of a natural disaster or other major incident. Redundancy and resiliency are watchwords of all critical infrastructure providers, so even if the power grid did fail, consumers might have to worry more about how to keep their phones charged rather than whether they could stay online. As if to underscore that point, the US government\u2019s advice to the public on how to prepare for a space weather event largely resembles the same steps you\u2019d take in response to an extended power outage. For example, the government recommends keeping extra batteries or a hand-powered charger available for small electronic devices. Officials say you may want to disconnect electric appliances to protect them from power surges and limit your electricity usage during a solar weather event. You may also want to keep your car\u2019s gas tank at least half-full so that you do not need to visit a gas station (which needs electricity to operate the pumps).

{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_business_florida-a-and-m-pauses-donation", "text": "Florida A&M University is putting a purported $237.75 million donation \u201con pause,\u201d after media reports and college board leaders raised concerns about the actual value of the stock gift\u2014and the details surrounding the donor\u2019s previous donations. \u201cA decision that was made yesterday to put a pause on this activity\u2014a hold, is more or less, is the language that was used\u2014pending some additional information that has come to my attention,\u201d FAMU President Larry Robinson said Thursday during an emergency school board meeting, called after media reports and school leaders raised concerns about the legitimacy of the gift. It\u2019s a stunning reversal from the fanfare last Saturday at FAMU\u2019s commencement ceremony, when the announcement of the gift made headlines as one of the largest ever personal donations ever to a historically Black college or university. Gregory Gerami, the 30-year-old CEO of Texas hydroponic hemp farm company Batterson Farms Corp., presented the $237.75 million stock gift via an oversized, ceremonial check to university administration members including Robinson, who called the gift \u201cbreathtaking in its generosity and its scope\u201d via a\u00a0press release\u00a0the day of the donation. But the jubilance quickly gave way to skepticism. A\u00a0report\u00a0from Politico noted Batterson Farms Corp.\u202fis a comparatively small company, and that its private shares are unlikely to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In 2020, a notable deal involving a donor later identified as Gerami fell apart. South Carolina\u2019s Coastal Carolina University had announced a $95 million donation from an anonymous donor, who then backed out months later. An investigation by the\u00a0Myrtle Beach Sun News\u00a0identified Gerami in a story that noted, among other details, that he backed out alleging racism from CCU officials\u2014an allegation they denied. At\u00a0an\u00a0emergency board meeting on Thursday, FAMU\u00a0board\u00a0of trustee\u00a0and foundation members expressed\u00a0their concerns and frustration about the school\u2019s vetting process involving Gerami\u2019s donation. Several members of the FAMU Foundation Board of Directors and Deveron Gibbons, the vice chair of the university\u2019s Board of Trustees, said they were not informed of the donation until it was announced at commencement. \u201cThis meeting is taking place because no one, as I am aware of from this conversation, had any clue this was going on,\u201d Gibbons told CNN.\u00a0\u201cWe are talking about a transformational, largest in HBCU history donation: big check on stage, with press involved and big PR campaign push after the fact. If that doesn\u2019t show that we need to take a step back and get our own house in order, I\u202fdon\u2019t know what else does.\u201d Gibbons has called for an independent investigation into the transaction. \u201cI hope that this is a good gift. It could be transformative for the university and much needed. But we must vet the process, doing an announcement is not the first thing you do \u2026 Vet the individual. You vet the donation,\u201d Vice Chair Gibbons said. Board Chair Kristin Harper provided a statement to CNN on Friday saying, \u201cSerious concerns have been raised regarding the validity of the gift, the adequacy of the due diligence processes and whether the Foundation Board and Board of Trustees have been provided ample oversight opportunity.\u201d \u201cI regrettably share these concerns\u201d Harper added. On May 5, just one day after the announcement at commencement, FAMU released a\u202fstatement via X (formerly Twitter)\u202finsisting the university had done its \u201cdue diligence.\u201d The statement went on to say that Gerami had transferred $237,750,000 of stocks into a FAMU account last month. A non-disclosure agreement requested by Gerami prohibited officials from disclosing the details to either the university\u2019s board of trustees or the board of directors, Vice President for University Advancement Shawnta Friday-Stroud said during an emergency meeting Thursday. \u201cIn addition to the wealth screening that was done at the beginning, we did a more expansive screening of Mr. Gerami\u2019s\u00a0background,\u201d Friday-Stroud said. \u201cWe had a discussion with Dr. Robinson, all of which has been put out on social media. We said, \u2018ok, we will proceed with the decision to move forward,\u201d Friday-Stroud added. \u201cMy concern is our reputation has been greatly impacted and I want to make sure that we restore faith in our alumni and all of the friends and family that support Florida A&M University,\u201d said FAMU Foundation Board member Terry Arnold. When reached by CNN on Thursday, Gerami declined immediate comment.\u00a0\u202fHe referred questions to the university and agreed to answer CNN\u2019s questions on the following day, but he couldn\u2019t be reached. FAMU\u2019s Special Board of Trustees, which oversees the full school and the foundation, has\u202fscheduled a\u00a0meeting for May 15\u00a0to discuss the donation. FAMU\u2019s communications department did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on more detailed questions about the gift and the nature of the vetting process.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/business/florida-a-and-m-pauses-donation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_tech_schumer-ai-framework", "text": "Federal legislation to govern artificial intelligence took another step closer to reality on Wednesday as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, along with a bipartisan trio of senators, announced a sprawling blueprint to shape how congressional committees tackle the technology in forthcoming bills. The 31-page roadmap released this week calls for billions of dollars in government spending to accelerate AI research and development, reflecting earlier commitments by Schumer, a Democrat from New York, and the so-called \u201cAI gang\u201d to prioritize US innovation in an intensely competitive field. It also instructs multiple Senate committees to come up with guardrails for AI to address some of its biggest risks, such as AI-enabled discrimination, job displacement and election interference. \u201cHarnessing the potential of AI demands an all-hands-on-deck approach and that\u2019s exactly what our bipartisan AI working group has been leading,\u201d Schumer said Wednesday. Some of the document\u2019s proposals reflect longstanding congressional goals, such as the creation of a national data privacy law that gives consumers more control over their personal information and which could help regulate AI companies\u2019 use of such data. Others appear modeled after legislation adopted by the European Union, such as a proposed ban on the use of AI for social scoring systems akin to those implemented by the Chinese government. And it urges congressional committees to develop coherent policies for when and how to impose export controls on \u201cpowerful AI systems\u201d \u2014 or for designating certain AI models as classified for national security purposes. The roadmap endorses a recommendation to allocate at least $32 billion a year, or at least 1% of US GDP, on AI research and development, a proposal issued in a 2021 report by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence. The organizing plan developed over months of meetings and listening sessions with top tech companies, civil rights leaders, labor unions and intellectual property holders. And it seeks to reinvigorate a legislative push that began last year, after Schumer took a personal role in spearheading the effort along with New Mexico Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich and Republican Sens. Mike Rounds of South Dakota and Todd Young of Indiana. \u201cThis roadmap represents the most comprehensive and impactful bipartisan recommendations on artificial intelligence ever issued by the legislative branch,\u201d Young said Wednesday. The latest plan highlights how Senate leaders are trying to move from a learning phase to an action phase, by issuing assignments to committees to craft legislation that may be passed piecemeal. Schumer has previously said that with the 2024 elections fast approaching, he may make it a top priority to pass legislation aimed at protecting the elections from AI-driven interference. Schumer has described regulating artificial intelligence as a challenge for Congress unlike any other, vowing a swift timeline measured in months, not years. But policy analysts, and some congressional aides, doubt whether Congress can pass significant legislation regulating AI in an election year. Meanwhile, the European Union has surged ahead with AI regulation, giving final approval in March to the trading bloc\u2019s landmark EU AI Act that bans certain AI applications altogether and imposes significant restrictions on others deemed to be \u201chigh-risk.\u201d On Wednesday, some in the tech industry applauded the Senate roadmap\u2019s release. \u201cThis AI policy roadmap is an encouraging start, focusing on defending the screen and recording industries against the use of unauthorized replicas,\u201d said Dana Rao, general counsel and chief trust officer at Adobe. \u201cIt will be important for governments to provide protections across the wider creative ecosystem.\u201d Rao urged lawmakers to pass legislation enshrining a national right against impersonation to protect artists from AI-generated clones of themselves. \u201cTechnology is borderless, and as a global leader in innovation, the US needs a clear national AI policy with guardrails so American innovation in AI can safely flourish,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, CEO of the Consumer Technology Association. Some consumer advocates were more critical, saying the roadmap was vague in its recommendations for addressing AI risks. \u201cThe framework eagerly suggests pouring Americans\u2019 tax dollars into AI research and development for military, defense, and private sector profiteering. Meanwhile, there\u2019s almost nothing meaningful around some of the most important and urgent AI policy issues like the technology\u2019s impact on policing, immigration, and worker\u2019s rights,\u201d said Evan Greer, director of the advocacy group Fight For the Future, adding that the document \u201creads like it was written by Sam Altman and Big Tech lobbyists.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/tech/schumer-ai-framework/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

Workers in some factories supplying Shein are still working 75-hour weeks,\u00a0according to an investigation by Public Eye, a Swiss human rights advocacy group that first highlighted the alleged abuse back in 2021. \u201cThe 75-hour weeks that we found out about two years ago still seem to be common at Shein,\u201d the Swiss organization said. Public Eye interviewed 13 textile workers employed at six factories in Guangzhou, a region in southern China, last summer. It found that staff worked an average of 12 hours a day, excluding lunch and dinner breaks, and usually for six or seven days a week. Shein does not reveal the identity of its suppliers, Public Eye said in its report. The group said it established that the factories were Shein suppliers through interviewees\u2019 responses as well as the presence of Shein products. Public Eye also claimed that workers\u2019 wages had hardly changed since its 2021 report. They fluctuated between 6,000 and 10,000 yuan per month ($829 and $1,382). However, after deducting pay for overtime, wages fell to about 2,400 ($332) a month. That\u2019s\u00a0well below the 6,512 yuan ($900) Public Eye says is a living wage in China, citing calculations by campaign group the Asia Floor Wage Alliance. \u201cI work every day from 8 in the morning to 10.30 at night and take one day off each month. I can\u2019t afford any more days off because it costs too much,\u201d Public Eye cited one worker as saying. Shein is\u00a0an online shopping retailer\u00a0founded in 2008 that sells its cut-price fast fashion apparel all over the world. In a statement to CNN the company said that it does \u201cnot recognize many of the allegations in (Public Eye\u2019s) report.\u201d \u201cThe Public Eye report is based on a sample of 13 interviewees and, though all voices in our supply chain are important, this small sample size should be seen in the context of our comprehensive ongoing process to continually improve our supply chain, which involves engaging with thousands of suppliers and workers within the supply chain,\u201d it added. In December 2022, Shein\u00a0announced plans\u00a0to invest $15 million to upgrade hundreds of factories belonging to its suppliers. That announcement followed a documentary\u00a0broadcast by the UK\u2019s Channel 4 that made allegations of labor exploitation against two of Shein\u2019s suppliers in China, with factory staff allegedly working\u00a018 hours a day and making pennies per item. On Monday, it said it continued to make substantial investments to strengthen governance and compliance among its suppliers. \u201cThese efforts are already delivering results, with our regular supplier audits showing a consistent improvement in performance and compliance by our supplier partners,\u201d Shein said in its statement. A spokesperson for Shein told CNN that the company requires its suppliers to cap workers schedules at 60 hours per week, including overtime, and to give workers at least one day off a week. Staff also have the right to refuse to work overtime. Third-party audits carried out between April 2022 and June 2023 showed that workers at its suppliers earned basic salaries that were, on average, more than double the local minimum wage, and \u201cmuch higher\u201d than the living wage in Shenzhen, about 81 miles south of Guangzhou, the spokesperson added. Public Eye said it did not return to Nancun, near Guangzhou \u2014 where Shein has its headquarters \u2014 to interview workers as it had done in 2021, because an increase in media scrutiny in the area made \u201cthe atmosphere too risky.\u201d Some workers also told investigators that they had noticed an rise in the number of surveillance cameras in the factories, and believed that the recordings were sent to Shein in real time to help the firm enforce its rules. Shein\u2019s suppliers \u201cmake their own decision to install cameras in their facilities\u201d to enhance security, but that it \u201cdoes not have access to suppliers\u2019 security camera feeds or footage,\u201d the company spokesperson told CNN. Public Eye\u2019s investigators also observed young people, judged to be about 14 or 15 years old, performing simple tasks, such as packaging, in some of the factories. \u201cWe strictly do not tolerate child labor. We treat any violations with utmost severity,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that \u201cany such violations found would result in the immediate termination of (the firm\u2019s) business relationship with the supplier.\u201d This article has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/business/shein-75-hour-weeks-investigation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_15_tech_tiktok-frank-mccourt-bid-creator-lawsuit", "text": "Another wealthy investor says he\u2019s organizing a bid to purchase TikTok, after President Joe Biden signed a law last month forcing TikTok to find a new owner or be banned in the United States. Frank McCourt, a real estate billionaire and the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, said Wednesday he is laying the groundwork to acquire TikTok as part of a broad initiative to make a healthier internet. McCourt, who has spent years accusing technology giants of exploiting their users and undermining the internet\u2019s original open vision, did not disclose how much he aims to spend on TikTok or how much he believes the platform is worth. Nor did he address how he plans to deal with the Chinese government\u2019s expected opposition to a forced sale, which would likely trigger export controls China has imposed on TikTok\u2019s\u00a0secretive recommendation algorithm. Still, McCourt said, the potential opportunity to acquire TikTok is a chance to rewire how social media works. Under McCourt\u2019s proposal, TikTok would operate on an open-source, decentralized protocol where users control their own data no matter what social media app they use. \u201cWe can, and must, do more to safeguard the health and well-being of our children, families, democracy and society,\u201d McCourt said in a statement. \u201cWe believe we can preserve \u2014 and enhance \u2014 the TikTok experience by giving individuals and creators on the platform the value and control they deserve regarding who has access to their data and how it is used.\u201d McCourt said he is working with the investment firm Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis to help assemble the bid, adding that the push is backed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web. McCourt joins a host of other would-be suitors angling to pick up a platform used by 170 million Americans. Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced in March he\u2019s assembling a bid, as well as Kevin O\u2019Leary, the Canadian chairman of the private venture capital firm O\u2019Leary Ventures. TikTok, meanwhile, has indicated that it\u2019s not for sale and the company has instead begun to mount a fight against the new law. The company sued to block the law earlier this month, saying that spinning off from its Chinese parent company is not feasible and that the legislation would lead to a ban of the app in the United States starting in January of next year. TikTok\u2019s lawsuit claims\u00a0the US government \u201chas taken the unprecedented step of expressly singling out and banning\u201d the short-form video app in an unconstitutional exercise of congressional power that would affect both the platform and its American users. A group of eight TikTok creators on Tuesday also filed a separate lawsuit challenging the potential ban. Their suit calls the law an \u201cextraordinary restraint on speech that violates the First Amendment\u201d and alleged that the law \u201cpromises to shutter a discrete medium of communication that has become part of American life.\u201d The group includes a college football coach; a rancher and former US marine; and a small business owner who runs a line of skincare products, among others, who collectively claim approximately 14 million followers on TikTok. Several of the creators claim they could lose money earned through TikTok\u2019s Creator Fund or by promoting their small businesses if the app were banned, and that their attempts to use other platforms have proven less fruitful. \u201cAs Americans, we should be able to pick whatever apps we use and the government shouldn\u2019t have the power to take that freedom away from us haphazardly,\u201d one of the creators involved in the suit, Topher Townsend, said in a statement. \u201cTikTok contributes significantly to my income and allowed the opportunity to be a full-time creator for almost four years now \u2026 This (new law) is being driven by larger politics, but the end result is going to harm a lot of people, including me.\u201d TikTok declined to comment on the creator lawsuit.

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications.

According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

Berkshire revealed it acquired nearly 26 million shares of Chubb in a Wednesday Securities and Exchange Commission filing of the company\u2019s first quarter investments. That translates to a value of approximately $6.7 billion. Buffett\u2019s company had shielded the position from public knowledge as it was building the stake, requesting \u201cconfidential treatment\u201d from the SEC in previous filings. Chubb, an insurance business that operates in 54 countries, made headlines in March after the company underwrote President Donald Trump\u2019s nearly $92 million appeal bond in E.

{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_business_grocery-prices-april", "text": "Food shoppers can finally breathe a slight sigh of relief: After years of increases followed by months of plateau, grocery prices fell last month. Grocery prices retreated 0.2% from March to April, adjusted for seasonal swings, according to inflation data released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But on the other end, food prices at restaurants rose 0.3% in that period. Food prices overall were flat as a result. The dip, while small, is a welcome reversal. Grocery prices began soaring at the start of the pandemic, far outpacing overall inflation for years as supply chains snarled, the war in Ukraine affected global crop exports, extreme weather damaged yields and corporations took an opportunity to pad prices. But back in February, overall food prices remained flat for the first time since April 2023. And now they\u2019ve actually gone down, even if only slightly. Still, grocery prices are higher than they were a year ago. In the 12 months through April, prices rose 1.1%. But overall inflation for that period was higher, up 3.4%. Apples and eggs take a plunge In that year-long period, a number of individual items got cheaper: Ham fell 3.4%, cheese dropped 3.3% and fish and seafood, along with potatoes, decreased 2.1%. Coffee prices went down 2%. Milk slipped 1.2%, and rice ticked down 1%. Two items saw notable drops: Apples, in the wake of a supply glut last year, plunged 12.7%. And eggs, last year the poster child for rising prices, were down 9%, continuing a more recent downward trend. Still, some items got more expensive over the course of the year, particularly beef, due in part to a constrained supply of cattle exacerbated by deadly wildfires in Texas. Uncooked beef roasts spiked 10.1%. And summer grilling season staples shot up as well, with hot dogs rising 7.1%, uncooked beef steaks up 6.5%, and uncooked ground beef rising by 6%. Elsewhere in the grocery store, flour rose 2.5% and fruits and vegetables together inched up 1.7%. From March to April, several grocery items got cheaper. In that month, eggs plunged 7.3% and apples fell 2.7%. Overall, fresh fruits and vegetables declined 1.1%. Milk fell 0.8% and poultry fell 0.6%. But some items got more expensive: Breakfast sausage jumped 3.4%, flour went up 3.2%, ham jumped 1.8% and bacon rose 0.8%. Fast food prices jump While grocery prices have been moderating, menu prices remain high, especially at fast food spots. In the year through April, prices at restaurants rose 4.1%. At sit-down restaurants, prices went up 3.4%, while at limited-service restaurants \u2014 where you\u2019re served at the counter \u2014\u00a0prices rose 4.8%. After years of rising menu prices, customers have started to pull back, visiting chains less often and spending less when they do.

{"id": "2024_05_15_business_inflation-biden-rate-fed", "text": "Some progressives have frequently blamed corporate greed for fueling the high cost of living that Americans are fed up with. Yet new research from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco casts doubt on the greedflation theory. Economists at the SF Fed found that corporate price gouging was not a primary catalyst for the inflation surge of 2021 to 2022. The Fed researchers did find that some companies exercised pricing power by raising prices above their production costs \u2013 a gap known as markups. For instance, markups spiked for gasoline, cars and other goods in 2021. Likewise, there were increased markups for repair, general merchandise, laundry, personal care and other services, according to the Fed. \u2018Not unusual\u2019 Of course, the inflation crisis was not limited to just a few key sectors. It was economy-wide. (The annual inflation rate fell slightly in April, but it still remains well above the Fed\u2019s 2% target.) When zooming out and looking at markups across the economy, the SF Fed economists found little evidence that price gouging was the main culprit. \u201cAggregate markups \u2013 the more relevant measure for overall inflation \u2013 have stayed essentially flat since the start of the recovery,\u201d the paper concluded. \u201cRising markups have not been a main driver of the recent surge and subsequent decline in inflation during the current recovery.\u201d In fact, the SF Fed found that the path of collective markups over the past three years \u201cis not unusual compared with previous recoveries.\u201d \u2018It angers them and angers me\u2019 This runs counters to the argument from some progressives including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who for years has refocused the inflation argument on corporate greed. \u201cRight now prices are up at the\u00a0pump, at the supermarket, and online. At the same time, energy companies, grocery companies, and online retailers are reporting record profits,\u201d Warren said in December 2021. \u201cThat\u2019s not simply a pandemic issue. It\u2019s not simply some inevitable economic force of nature. It\u2019s greed\u2014and in some cases, it is flatly illegal.\u201d More recently, President Joe Biden has called out corporate greed as a reason prices remain high. \u201cIf you take a look at what people have, they have the money to spend. It angers them and angers me that you have to spend more,\u201d Biden told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett, pointing to the shrinking size of Snickers bars and other food products. \u201cIt\u2019s like 20% less for the same price. That\u2019s corporate greed. That\u2019s corporate greed. And we have got to deal with it. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m working on.\u201d In February, Biden said there are \u201cstill too many corporations in America ripping people off. Price gouging, junk fees, greedflation, shrinkflation.\u201d \ufeff\u201cAmerica \u2013 we\u2019re tired of being played for suckers!\u201d Biden said. Although the paper did not directly mention corporate greed, shrinkflation or Biden, the research undercuts the argument that greedflation drove the early inflation. White House spokesperson Jeremy Edwards told CNN in a statement that the study supports Biden\u2019s argument that \u201crecord profits are increasing inflation in some sectors, such as gas and general merchandise.\u201d \u201cThese markups should have reversed as we recovered from the pandemic\u2014the fact that they haven\u2019t means prices can come down if corporate profits come back to earth,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cPresident Biden has repeatedly called on large corporations to pass their record profits along to their customers by lowering prices. And he is taking on corporate rip-offs like hidden junk fees that costs families billions of dollars a year. The President will continue to call out corporate rip-offs and fight to keep money in Americans\u2019 pockets.\u201d \u2018Looking for scapegoats\u2019 The debate comes as inflation remains a major frustration for Americans \u2013 and a significant political liability for Biden ahead of the November election. Consumer sentiment, a metric closely tracked by the White House, unexpectedly tumbled to a six-month low at the start of May. It was the biggest one-month drop in nearly three years, a deterioration driven in part by concerns about inflation and interest rates. Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist at AGF Investments, said the White House is \u201cdesperate to blame someone or something for inflation.\u201d \u201cBlaming greedy corporations is just looking for scapegoats,\u201d Valliere told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s no prescriptions here that would have a major impact quickly, other than the Fed reluctantly raising interest rates \u2013 an option that, incredibly, isn\u2019t out of the question.\u201d Many economists blame the recent inflation surge on more traditional factors, namely higher production costs linked to swings in demand and Covid-era supply trouble. To be sure, inflation has improved dramatically over the past two years. After peaking at 9% in June 2022, annual inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) has eased to the low-to-mid 3% range. Rate cuts delayed However, progress in the inflation fight has stalled recently and the last three months of data have shown prices increased by more than expected. And inflation remains well above the 2% targeted by the Federal Reserve. The so-called final mile of returning inflation back to normal has proven to be difficult. This situation has prevented the Fed from giving Americans a break from elevated borrowing costs, which remain at two-decade highs. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated Tuesday that it \u201clooks like it will take longer for us to become confident that inflation is coming down to 2% over time.\u201d Although the SF Fed report pokes holes in the greedflation argument, other research has been more mixed. For instance, progressive advocacy group Groundwork Collaborative recently argued that corporate profits drove 53% of inflation during the second and third quarters of 2023. That report found corporate profits were to blame for 34% of inflation since the start of Covid-19. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason most Americans blame corporate greed for high prices, and it\u2019s because they know price-gouging when they see it,\u201d\u00a0Caroline Ciccone, president of progressive watchdog group\u00a0Accountable.US, said in a statement. \u201cIt simply doesn\u2019t add up when corporations enjoying record profits, enriching investors and giving their CEOs huge bonuses claim creeping price hikes were out of their control. They could have passed some success onto consumers in the form of stable and reasonable prices, but many chose to profiteer again and again.\u201d Last year, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City found that corporate profits contributed 41% to inflation during the first two years of the Covid recovery. However, that same Kansas City Fed paper noted that this is not unusual and corporate profits contributed even more (59% on average) to inflation during prior economic recoveries.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/business/inflation-biden-rate-fed/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_economy_consumer-price-index-inflation-april", "text": "All three major indexes surged to record highs Wednesday after new data showed that inflation cooled in April after ticking up recently.  The S&P 500, tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and blue-chip Dow all closed at new record highs after the latest Consumer Price Index showed that prices were up 3.4% for the 12 months ended in April, easing from 3.5% the month before. The broad-market S&P 500 gained more than 1.2% on Wednesday and cracked the 5,300-level for the first time, closing at 5,308.15. The Nasdaq was about 1.4% higher, setting a new record at 16,742.39. The Dow, meanwhile, was up 350 points or 0.9% and teetered near the key 40,000-level, closing at 39,908. All three major indexes are tracking toward a winning week. Investors believe that the cooler inflation reading, coupled with a separate report showing weak retail sales in April, increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year. \u201cTaken [together with retail sales] this supports a Fed rate cut in the fall,\u201d Gary Pzegeo, head of fixed income at CIBC Private Wealth US, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. \u201cMarkets are discounting a cut in September and have moved to price in a second cut by December.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s report landed mostly in line with economists\u2019 expectations, which is a welcome turnabout from January, February and March, when CPI (and other inflation gauges) came in hot, hot, and hot. \u201cThis was a good report in the context of three hotter-than-expected [CPI] reports, and it makes it look like potentially those were bumps in the road rather than a really stagnant inflation environment,\u201d Tyler Schipper, economics professor at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota, told CNN in an interview. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.3%, a slower pace of growth than the 0.4% seen in the two months prior, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 CPI report. Economists were expecting a 0.4% monthly increase and an annual gain of 3.4%, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Rising gasoline and shelter costs accounted for more than 70% of the monthly increase in overall inflation, according to the report. While elevated housing costs and high prices at the pump continue to weigh on Americans, Wednesday\u2019s report did provide some welcome news on another staple spending area: Grocery prices fell for the first time in a year, dropping 0.2% from March. A closely watched underlying measurement of inflation showed even more progress. Core CPI, which strips out the more volatile categories of energy and food, slowed from 3.8% to 3.6%, its lowest rate since April 2021. From the month before, core CPI ticked up by 0.3%, its slowest pace since the end of last year. Prices are cooling but some pain points remain In addition to grocery prices falling for the month, overall food prices and the cost of going out to eat saw some easing as well. Food price inflation held pat at 2.2% annually, while food away from home inflation ticked down to 4.1%, its lowest rate since May 2021. New and used car prices continued to fall from record heights; but, especially in this period of high interest rates, they remain costly endeavors \u2014 not only to purchase but also to maintain. Motor vehicle insurance continued its painful rise in April, climbing 1.8% for the month and rising to 22.6% annually. Repair and maintenance costs were flat for the month but are still running well above overall inflation at 7.6% annually. Apparel prices jumped higher for the month, with some categories such as men\u2019s shirts and women\u2019s suits up nearly 3%. For those to leap higher at a time when goods prices are seeing disinflation (in some cases, outright deflation), could be a reflection of broader trade problems globally and a potential issue for consumers \u2014 and incumbents \u2014 later this year, Schipper said. \u201cIt might not be particularly problematic now; but if you think about the fall, when it\u2019s election season, and people are doing back-to-school shopping, that could be a category that becomes politically problematic,\u201d Schipper said. A slow drift downward However, April\u2019s report did show some slight progress on what\u2019s been the biggest Achilles heel: Shelter inflation eased to 5.5%, its lowest annual rate since May 2022. Housing costs \u201chave been a pretty persistent area of pain over the past several years,\u201d John Sedunov, professor of finance and real estate at Villanova University, told CNN. The housing component of the CPI has proved frustrating for economists and other observers because the government\u2019s measurement of shelter costs come with a considerable lag. Private sector sources of real estate data have shown a cooling rental market. When taking those housing costs out of the equation, a closely watched \u201csupercore\u201d index measuring services inflation that excludes shelter costs rose just 0.2% for the month, its slowest pace since last summer. The Federal Reserve has been wanting to see meaningful process on inflation before it starts trimming back interest rates. Those rates are at a 23-year high following an aggressive, yearslong rate-hiking campaign by the central bank to throw water on smoldering demand and tame decades-high inflation. \u201cThe last month or two had looked like maybe the improvement was stalling, and this [report] looks like it\u2019s continuing at a slow pace,\u201d Erica Groshen, a former BLS commissioner who serves as senior economics adviser at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told CNN. Inflation has cooled considerably after spiking to 9.1% annually in June 2022, and the economy has remained resilient in the process \u2014 although there are signals that the once-rampant pace of spending activity has cooled. A separate report on Wednesday showed that US retail sales were flat in April. \u201cPotentially, that\u2019s an indication of consumers getting tapped out,\u201d Sedunov said. \u201cAt the end of the day, that retail softening is an indicator that maybe there\u2019s going to be less pressure on prices in certain areas going forward, which could have a continuing moderating effect on inflation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/economy/consumer-price-index-inflation-april/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}

The company had previously warned that achieving its goal of taking the 168-year-old brand further upmarket, to become the definition of \u201cModern British Luxury,\u201d had been harder than expected after demand for luxury had slowed. Sales fell 12% in the final quarter, dragged down by a 19% slump in China, and wiping out gains made earlier in the year, Burberry said Wednesday. It reported operating profit of \u00a3418 million ($526.4 million). Sales in London, its home market, declined 17%, which Chief Executive Jonathan Akeroyd blamed on a lack of tax-free shopping for tourists. \u201cSpending by Chinese tourists at our stores in London is less than half of what it was compared to the pre-pandemic, whereas it\u2019s more than tripled in Paris,\u201d Akeroyd said. Sales in continental Europe rose 8% in the last quarter of 2023. Akeroyd said that, while the financial results underperformed the company\u2019s original expectations, it had made good progress refocusing its brand. The British fashion house has lagged higher-end competitors like\u00a0Hermes\u00a0and\u00a0Prada,\u00a0which have reported increases in sales. However, the sector as a whole is still struggling.

{"id": "2024_05_11_business_applebees-chilis-mcdonalds-prices", "text": "McDonald\u2019s and other fast food chains are charging more. So much so that you may want to consider going for a slightly slower burger. Or at least, that\u2019s what Applebee\u2019s wants you to think about. \u201cYou can get our burger for $9.99,\u201d John Peyton, CEO of Applebee\u2019s parent company Dine Brands, told CNN in an interview. With that in mind, \u201cwhy would you take a $10 burger \u2026 that you can eat in a bag out of your car?\u201d If Peyton\u2019s sales pitch resonates with customers, it could help convince diners to eat at sit-down restaurants, something they might otherwise see as an indulgence. For a while, restaurant customers were trading down \u2014 swapping out expensive meals for cheaper ones, but still dining out. Now, some are responding to higher menu prices by trading out entirely: Instead of opting for cheaper restaurants or meals, they\u2019re eating more at home and spending less when they do go out. That means that restaurants have to battle it out for these cost-conscious consumers. And now, it\u2019s not just burger chain against burger chain. Because fast food joints have been hiking up prices in recent years, dine-in spots like Applebee\u2019s can run promotions that end up costing about the same as a fast food lunch \u2014 giving them a chance to try to steal those customers away. The overlap offers \u201ca new opportunity,\u201d according to Peyton. Lunch at McDonald\u2019s now costs about the same as lunch at Applebee\u2019s, where you can sit at a table and have your meal delivered by a server. Pointing that out is a new way to bid for customers. Applebee\u2019s, which has seen sales slump as lower-income customers pull back, is offering deals and hoping the prices will speak for themselves. Chili\u2019s, on the other hand, is making the comparison more explicit. For them, and the fast food chains they\u2019re now competing against, the stakes are high. A smaller pie Years of price hikes have\u00a0contributed to declining traffic, pushing restaurants to fight over fewer customers, according to David Henkes, a senior principal at Technomic, a food industry research and consulting firm. \u201cIt\u2019s a smaller pie today than it was a year ago,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re competing for a share of a smaller market. And so it is more competitive.\u201d Fast food prices, in particular, have shot up. \u201cFast food has gotten really expensive,\u201d Henkes said. \u201cCertainly, relative to where it was 12 to 18 months ago, and also in comparison to casual dining sit-down restaurants right now.\u201d In the 12 months through March, not adjusting for seasonal swings, prices at fast food and fast casual restaurants went up 5%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In that period full-service menu prices went up 3.2%, and grocery prices ticked up 1.2%. A few years ago, McDonald\u2019s\u00a0said that it could raise prices without losing too many customers. But now, it\u2019s struggling with lower-income customers. CEO Chris Kempczinski said\u00a0during a February analyst call\u00a0that \u201cthe battle ground is certainly with that low-income consumer.\u201d The following month, CFO Ian Borden conceded\u00a0during another analyst call\u00a0that \u201cit\u2019s a challenging consumer environment.\u201d The chain is working on a $5 menu to win over those customers, according to Bloomberg. Things aren\u2019t much better over at Applebee\u2019s. Sales at US Applebee\u2019s locations open at least a year\u00a0slumped 4.6% in the first quarter. In that period, customers who earn $50,000 a year or less visited less often, and spent less when they did, Peyton said, adding that the demographic makes up about 45% of Applebee\u2019s customers. \u201cFor several quarters\u2026 we\u2019ve been asking ourselves, when will we see the impact of inflation, and the economy in general, and interest rates, on on our guest,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really began to see it in the first quarter.\u201d He added that \u201cwe think it\u2019s going to be a fight for share of wallet and market share all year.\u201d Fast food as a foil With fast food prices high, sit-down restaurants can make a case for themselves. People have taken their fast food price grievances to social channels, some complaining about the price of McDonald\u2019s burgers and hash browns. Chili\u2019s has been paying attention. \u201cOur social media team has been watching the conversation that the consumer is frustrated by fast food prices,\u201d said Kevin Hochman, president of Chili\u2019s and CEO of its parent company, Brinker International, during an April analyst call. In response, Chili\u2019s decided to run ads that \u201cuse fast food as a foil,\u201d he said. The chain said in an April press release that it was adding a new burger \u2014 which it described as having \u201ctwice the beef of a Big Mac and flavors fast food lovers will recognize\u201d \u2014 to its \u20183 for me\u2019 value menu. For $10.99, customers get the burger plus an app and a drink. On X, Chili\u2019s asked whether Chili\u2019s is better than fast food, and promised rewards to those who said yes. Chili\u2019s also ran video ads comparing its food favorably to fast food burgers. But it might not be that easy. Getting people to go to Chili\u2019s instead of McDonald\u2019s may be a stretch, said Henkes. One problem for chains like Chili\u2019s and Applebee\u2019s is that they\u2019re not so much competing on price, as they are on time. \u201cPeople go to sit-down restaurants, generally speaking, for different occasions, than they go to fast food restaurants,\u201d Henkes noted. You might expect to spend an hour at a Chili\u2019s or an Applebee\u2019s, and breeze right through a McDonald\u2019s. Still, campaigns like Chili\u2019s can help communicate to customers that these days its food is relatively cheap. \u201cPlanting that seed that, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re a good value,\u2019 I think is a good message to have,\u201d Henkes said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/business/applebees-chilis-mcdonalds-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_business_us-tariffs-ev-europe-china-trade", "text": "US President Joe Biden has quadrupled tariffs on electric vehicles from China to 100%, effectively sealing off one of the world\u2019s biggest passenger car markets to the largest global producer of EVs. \u201cI\u2019m determined that the future of electric vehicles will be made in America by union workers,\u201d Biden said Tuesday. But the real battleground over EVs may lie far beyond US shores \u2014 in Europe. The United States currently buys very few EVs from China. It\u2019s a very different matter in Europe \u2014 by far the biggest export market for Chinese EV manufacturers. Washington\u2019s drastic measure piles pressure on the European Union to defend its automakers, which are likely to face even fiercer competition from Chinese EV imports if they\u2019re all but priced out of the United States. Joseph Webster, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said the latest US tariffs on EVs and other goods from China, including semiconductors and batteries, might \u201cforce Brussels\u2019 hand\u201d since higher US tariffs could divert much of the trade to Europe. \u201cBrussels will have to act quickly, either to put its own tariffs in place or to accept a flood of Chinese-made products,\u201d he added in comments on the think tank\u2019s website. The EU is already investigating state support for Chinese EV makers and, if it finds that their prices are artificially low, it will announce extra import duties by early July. Brussels suspects that subsidies by Beijing may be creating unfair competition for European carmakers. Agatha Kratz, a director at research provider Rhodium Group, said the hike in US tariffs on Chinese EVs makes it \u201ceasier\u201d for the EU to take its tariffs \u201call the way to 30%,\u201d triple their current level. But it would be \u201cvery hard\u201d for Brussels to match US tariffs, she told CNN. The EU \u201ccan\u2019t justify going much higher (than 30%) as the duties need to be aligned with the findings of the investigation on the scale of subsidization in China.\u201d \u201cThis means that the EU will need to explore other tools and defensive instruments to try and stem the flow of China-made EVs coming into Europe,\u201d she added. They could include measures targeting data security, and strict enforcement of environmental and labor standards. EU tariffs could backfire According to Citi, the EU accounted for 36% of Chinese EV exports last year, more than the next five largest markets combined. By contrast, the United States currently receives just 1.1% of China\u2019s EV exports. That amounts to less than $365 million, according to consultancy Capital Economics. Chinese brands enjoy much lower production costs than their European rivals. This means that duties of 40% to 50% would probably be necessary \u201cto make the European market unattractive for Chinese EV exporters,\u201d Kratz and other researchers at Rhodium Group argue. For BYD, China\u2019s biggest EV maker, the tariffs would likely have to be even higher to be effective, they add. Duties at such levels are unlikely, however, according to Rhodium Group. That\u2019s also because they could ultimately hurt European automakers, many of which manufacture cars in China that they then sell in Europe. On an earnings call with reporters last week, BMW CEO Oliver Zipse warned Europe to proceed with caution. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that our industry needs protection,\u201d he later told analysts, adding that operating on a global basis is an advantage. \u201cYou can easily endanger that advantage by introducing import tariffs.\u201d The EU will also want to avoid provoking retaliation from Beijing, which could make life difficult for European carmakers selling in China. \u201cThe EU\u2019s situation is very different than the US\u2026 since the German automakers rely so heavily on the China market for significant sales (and) profits,\u201d said Tu Le, managing director at Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. \u201cThat makes the chances of (the EU) doing something heavy-handed very low.\u201d Trade war brewing? Biden\u2019s tariffs speak to a growing sense of urgency among Western officials to prevent domestic jobs and strategically important industries from being wiped out by cheap Chinese imports. As a trade partner, China is more important to the EU than to the United States \u2014 crucially, it represents a much bigger market for EU goods exports. Nonetheless, Brussels is taking a more protective stance on trade. In addition to the probe into Chinese EVs, the EU is investigating alleged dumping of industrial products by China or unfair state support for Chinese makers of wind turbines. \u201cThe EU is using its whole toolbox at the moment to defend its economy and European jobs from what it perceives to be unfair trade practices from China,\u201d said Kratz from Rhodium Group, who suggested the EU and China are already engaged in a low-level trade war. \u201cI\u2019d say we are entering a very tense period in terms of trade interactions and trade defense,\u201d she added. The United States may also pressure the EU and other allies to reduce their reliance on trade with China, as it has successfully done with semiconductors. In a statement announcing the tariffs Tuesday, the White House said it would continue to work with allies \u201cto strengthen cooperation to address shared concerns about China\u2019s unfair practices.\u201d Leaders from the Group of Seven developed economies will discuss how to protect their industries from Chinese competition at a summit in Italy next month. \u201cThe next few weeks will be telling,\u201d said Josh Lipsky, a senior director at the Atlantic Council. \u201cIf Europe and the G7 countries match or mirror US policies\u2026 it may cause Beijing to realize that this time is different,\u201d he wrote in comments Tuesday. \u201cOn the other hand, if Europe hedges (its bets), coming out of its own anti-dumping review, it could affirm China\u2019s view that their challenge is primarily with the United States, not the rest of the advanced economies.\u201d Juliana Liu in Hong Kong contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/business/us-tariffs-ev-europe-china-trade/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_tech_uber-lyft-massachusetts-trial", "text": "Uber\u00a0and Lyft\u00a0are set to face trial on Monday in a\u00a0US\u00a0lawsuit by Massachusetts\u2019 attorney general alleging the ride-share companies misclassified their drivers as independent contractors rather than more costly employees. The non-jury trial in Boston comes amid\u00a0broader legal and political battles\u00a0in the Democratic-led state and elsewhere nationally over the status of drivers for app-based companies whose rise has fueled the\u00a0US gig worker economy. Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell is asking a judge to conclude that drivers for\u00a0Uber\u00a0and Lyft are employees under state law and therefore entitled to benefits such as a minimum wage, overtime and earned sick time. Her office claims the companies for years misclassified thousands of Massachusetts drivers and cannot meet a three-part test under the state\u2019s worker-friendly laws that would allow them to be deemed independent contractors. Studies have shown that using contractors can cost companies\u00a0as much as 30% less\u00a0than using employees. Uber (UBER)\u00a0and Lyft (LYFT) argue that they properly classified the drivers, saying they are not transportation companies that employ drivers but technology companies whose apps facilitate connections between drivers and potential riders. The companies warn\u00a0that, should Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Peter Krupp rule against them, they would be unable to maintain\u00a0their\u00a0flexible business model in the state and may be forced to cut or cease operations in Massachusetts. Rohit Singla, a lawyer for Lyft, during a Thursday pre-trial hearing said his client\u2019s \u201ccurrent business cannot support drivers as employees, is not set up for that and wouldn\u2019t work that way.\u201d The case is going to trial a week after Massachusetts\u2019 highest court\u00a0heard arguments\u00a0over whether to allow an industry-backed ballot measure to go before voters in November that defines the drivers as contractors but entitles them to some new benefits. The court appeared open to allowing some version of that proposal to go on the ballot along with a rival, labor-backed ballot measure that seeks to allow the drivers to unionize. The lawsuit going to trial was filed in 2020 by Campbell\u2019s predecessor, Maura Healey, now the state\u2019s Democratic governor. Should the state prevail, it has said the companies could face large penalties for not properly classifying their drivers. By not classifying their Massachusetts drivers as employees,\u00a0Uber\u00a0and Lyft avoided paying $266.4 million into workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment insurance and paid family medical leave over 10 years, according to a report by the state auditor.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/tech/uber-lyft-massachusetts-trial/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_success_college-tuition-payment-options", "text": "The good news is your child got into college and is preparing to enroll this fall. The bad news is that you\u2019ve just learned the aid package your child\u2019s school is offering is much smaller than you\u2019d hoped. That means your share of the total cost of college may be larger than what you have at the ready. The gap for some parents and students can be much worse if you consider top schools in New England, where the annual sticker price before aid is now $90,000 or more. The total average annual cost came to $60,420 at private four-year colleges in 2023, according to the College Board. After accounting for the average aid offer to offset tuition costs, students and their parents were still on the hook to pay an average of nearly $35,000. But even when students enroll in less expensive public universities, for any parent who doesn\u2019t have a fat 529 college savings and investment plan, or any at all, it\u2019s sobering to realize that in the next few months you\u2019re going to have to come up with a lot more money than you were expecting. Exactly how to do that is the question. \u201cThere is no magic bullet,\u201d said Beth Walker, founder of the Center for College Planning Solutions and author of \u201cNever Pay Retail for College.\u201d But here are some suggestions that may help, or at least buy you a little time to figure out how to handle all the education expenses coming due in the next four years \u2014 or longer, if you have younger kids who are also planning to go to college. Your child may have to borrow money. Try not to feel guilty If you never wanted your children to be saddled with debt before graduating from college, you might rethink that. Freshmen can take out a $5,500 federal Stafford loan at a relatively favorable interest rate. The rate for the 2024-2025 school year will be 6.53%.  Over four years of college, students can take out a total of up to $27,000. What\u2019s more, they don\u2019t have to pay the money back while they\u2019re in school, and they can get a favorable income-driven repayment plan after graduating. \u201cIt\u2019s their best financing tool available,\u201d Walker said. If it really pains you to see them assume debt, remember you can plan now to help them pay it off once they\u2019ve graduated, she noted. Other borrowing options Beyond Stafford loans, there are other borrowing options, but they all come with big caveats: Private student loans: Some students may also take out a private student loan, which doesn\u2019t provide any of the flexible repayment protections they have with federal loans, and could come with a much higher interest rate. But if your child doesn\u2019t have a credit history, you will need to cosign the loan. So you should think about whether you can assume the risks of repaying that money if your child can\u2019t pay it off, especially if the loan you choose doesn\u2019t allow you to defer payment until your child graduates. Parental loans: Parents can also take out a federal Direct PLUS loan. But Joseph Bogardus, a certified financial planner who specializes in college cost planning, is not a big fan because of its high fees (over 4% of the loan amount), the fact that there is no real break on the interest rate (it will be 9.08% for school year 2024-2025) and parents may have to start repaying it while the student is in school, unless they request a deferment. As he put it, \u201cIf you can\u2019t afford to pay $500 a month now, what makes you think you\u2019ll be able to pay $1,000 a month later?\u201d Your 401(k): Taking a withdrawal from your retirement savings may be tempting, but it\u2019s never a great idea. No one is going to fund your retirement if you don\u2019t. But if you are thinking of using some retirement money, make sure to first directly roll over the amount from your 401(k) into an IRA. You will have to pay income taxes on the money, but if you\u2019re under 59-1/2 you will not be hit with a 10% early withdrawal penalty in an IRA if you use the money for qualified educational expenses, Bogardus said. Your credit card: A bad idea. Skip to the next options. The average credit card rate is north of 20%.\u00a0And if you can\u2019t pay off a large sum right away or you can only make the minimum payments due every month, you risk never getting out of that debt cycle. Home equity line of credit: If you\u2019re in a real pinch for your child\u2019s freshman year, and you have substantial equity in your home, Walker said, you might consider an interest-only home equity line of credit as a short-term cash-flow option. \u201cThat\u2019s cash-flow friendly while your child is in college,\u201d Walker said. \u201cYou\u2019re renting money on the cheap to buy time to figure out how you\u2019ll do this.\u201d So, say you take out a $20,000 interest-only HELOC at 8%. That means you\u2019ll only have to pay roughly $133 a month in interest, or $1,600 for the year. You will, however, have to pay the principal back after a given term \u2014 typically 10 years. And if you can\u2019t do so in full, you will have to pay interest and principal on the remaining balance until it\u2019s paid off. Redirect current spending and savings Even smaller measures can help somewhat in closing the funding gap if you\u2019re looking to raise some cash between now and the fall. Quantify how much a teenager at home costs: Walker said parents often overlook the expense of having their children under the same roof. She recommends evaluating how much your college-bound student costs you while they are at home. Think food, gas, entertainment, incidentals, etc. That\u2019s money you\u2019ll be able to redirect toward college costs when they leave home. Redirect discretionary income to savings: During the few months before the bill for the first semester comes due, temporarily cut back on your discretionary spending (e.g., travel and entertainment) and redirect that money into a high-yield savings account. Temporarily pause or reduce some retirement contributions: It\u2019s not optimal, but if you feel you\u2019re doing okay in terms of your retirement savings, you might temporarily redirect the money from your paycheck that would have gone into your 401(k) or IRA for the next three months and put it into the college kitty instead. But, Bogardus cautioned, \u201cYou don\u2019t want it to be a crutch. Think of the oxygen mask analogy: When doing this, parents should be in a good position first for their own future, then concern themselves with their student\u2019s college costs.\u201d Be honest about what you can afford College is among the biggest financial investments parents and their children will ever make. Ideally, key questions like \u201cHow much can we afford?\u201d should be raised no later than when your child is a sophomore in high school, at which point you can better set expectations of the kind of school you (and they) can afford, Walker said. So if you find yourself in a bind with your first-born this summer, you can at least be better prepared when your second child starts thinking about college. You both should take a hard look at different colleges\u2019 costs, Walker suggested, and ask: Is a Bachelor\u2019s degree from a school that costs two to three times as much as another really going to be worth two to three times as much when the child graduates? Also, Bogardus suggests checking to see if your state offers a tuition aid plan or subsidized loan rates for educational expenses. For instance, he said, see if your state has a program that offers a year or two of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to the state university from which your child could earn their degree.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/success/college-tuition-payment-options/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "business"}}
