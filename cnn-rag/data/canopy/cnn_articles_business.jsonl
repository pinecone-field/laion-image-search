{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_business_fast-fashion-wedding-dresses", "text": "Wedding dress shopping may never go back to what it used to be. Instead of collecting your entire bridal entourage to spend a few hours at a boutique trying on several dresses for the perfect find at a lofty price of a $1,000 or more, some retailers are offering to make the wedding dress hunt as easy breezy as buying a T-shirt off the rack. Taking their cue from Millennials and Gen Zers who are turning stuffy traditions on their head and marking life\u2019s milestones moments \u2014 such as weddings \u2014 in their own pared down way, a string of affordable fashion brands have jumped into the weddings industry to appease thrifty shoppers with inexpensive bridal wear. Abercrombie, Forever 21, Boot Barn, Shein and Lulus, better known for their tank tops, shorts, ripped jeans, bikinis, cowboy boots and sparkly dresses tailor-made for Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift concertgoers, are trying to dress brides for much less. The move isn\u2019t a complete headscratcher. For one, it allows these mass-market brands to get their slice of the more than $100 billion US wedding industry, according to The Knot Worldwide, a wedding planning and vendor marketplace. \u201cThese companies see bridal as a natural extension of their business given that they are already present in many of these product categories,\u201d said Janine Stichter,\u00a0managing director and consumer retail and lifestyle brands analyst with global financial services and market research firm BTIG. Plus, many of their core customers are older GenZers and younger Millennials who are in the sweet spot age demographic for getting married and attending weddings, she said. \u201cThe move into wedding wear makes sense so long as it\u2019s not a distraction from their core business,\u201d Stichter said. One-stop-shop for jeans and a wedding dress Clothing store Abercrombie & Fitch \u2014 which has undergone a major metamorphosis by shedding its overtly sexualized marketing strategy of the past to more on-trend, age-appropriate and parent-approved clothing \u2014 is continuing its evolution, by going after brides. The retailer in March launched the A&F Wedding Shop, a collection of more than 100 pieces for brides, the bridal party and wedding guests, all priced from $80 to $150. Beyond dresses, the collection includes items such as bikinis, pajamas and skirts for other events tied to the wedding. \u201cOur customers live for the long weekend, and when we asked them about their exciting upcoming getaways, we heard so many of them speak about wedding weekends, wedding-adjacent occasions, and the all-important question of what to wear, which this collection is perfectly designed to answer,\u201d Carey Collins Krug, chief marketing officer of Abercrombie & Fitch Co., said in a statement announcing the launch. In April, fast-fashion brand Forever 21 debuted its first bridal collection, priced from $9 to about $50. The clothing includes dresses, sleepwear, accessories, such as a wedding-ready cowboy hat with a veil affixed to it. A white strapless satin and lace midi dress from its bridal shop has a pricetag of $24.29, while another altar-ready white split-hem halter midi dress will set a bride back only $27. That\u2019s a basement bargain compared to the average  wedding dress cost last year of $2,000. California-based trendy fashion chain Lulus has also got in on the act by opening its first bridal boutique, with dresses ranging from $100 to $270, in Los Angeles in February. \u201cAt Lulus, brides won\u2019t have to compromise. Attaining that luxurious look without breaking their budgets isn\u2019t a dream, it\u2019s a reality,\u201d\u00a0Crystal Landsem, Lulus CEO, said in a statement in February. The standalone bridal boutique builds on Lulus\u2019 2019 entry into wedding wear and \u201cenables the brand to offer its customer-first online experience to brides in real life,\u201d the retailer said in a press release. That\u2019s a smart move, said Allyson Rees, a senior insight strategist at trend forecasting and analytics firm WGSN, in an interview with CNN. \u201cFor these bridal collections to land with Gen Z, It\u2019s important that these brands tap into the way that Gen Z shops. Gen Z is always online, but 97% of US Gen Z still shop in-store,\u201d Rees said. \u201cWedding dresses, in particular, and the tradition of trying them on, is a rite of passage that Gen Z still want to partake in. So brands will need to create compelling in-store experiences that encourage socializing.\u201d A lot less traditional As the oldest GenZers reach marrying age in their mid-20s, they\u2019re increasingly putting their own spin on nuptials and are letting go of some antiquated traditions. Part of this is also being driven by these younger non-conforming consumers being forced into even more cost sensitivity than\u00a0Millennials. \u201cThe cost-of-living crisis has affected Gen Z, and they feel deeply insecure about their finances,\u201d said Rees. \u201cOver half are living paycheck to paycheck and a third are living with their parents. So it\u2019s no surprise that fast fashion, which has seen its market share increase over the last few years due to the cost-of-living crisis, is capitalizing on the need for affordable, on-trend wedding fashion.\u201d At the same time, wedding fashion is a lot less traditional now, she said. With wedding dresses in particular, one trend that emerged during the pandemic was the popularity of black wedding gowns. \u201cGen Z is very much picking up where Millennials left off here. So it\u2019s not uncommon for brides to wear alternative colors to white, or to change outfits several times during the course of the event. So this an area where fast fashion brands can really fill a void,\u201d Rees said. Shein, which launched in 2012 and has since ballooned into the world\u2019s biggest online-only fast-fashion seller, also sells bridal and wedding wear. Its bridal gowns cost on average between $50 and $100, up to a maximum of $200. On Memorial Day weekend, the retailer will open a wedding-related pop-up shop in Las Vegas to showcase its new bridal gowns and bridesmaid dresses. \u201cAffordable prices are important for Gen Z customers, who often balance the desire for fashionable and trendy styles with a need for options that won\u2019t break the bank,\u201d Lisa Zlotnick, spokesperson for Shein, said in an interview with CNN. \u201cAs wedding attire evolves from traditional, occasion-specific outfits to versatile, stylish pieces that can be worn on multiple occasions, we aim to ensure our offerings meet this increasing demand.\u201d Even Boot Barn, which sells cowboy boots and westernwear, has jumped on the wedding bandwagon for the first time, with its new western-themed wedding collection of bridal dresses, cowboy boots, hats and accessories priced mostly at $400 and below. \u201cThere\u2019s been a surge in country weddings and casual garden weddings coming out of the pandemic as people wanted to get married outdoors. These are also budget-friendly choices,\u201d said Isha Nicole, senior vice president of marketing with Boot Barn, in an interview. \u201cCouples are trying to move away from something that is formal and stuffy to weddings that embrace a different setting. We looked at these trends and it seemed like a right time to support our customer,\u201d Nicole said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/business/fast-fashion-wedding-dresses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

The investigations involve Waymo, the self-driving technology subsidiary of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet, as well as Zoox, the autonomous vehicle subsidiary of Amazon. The companies are required by regulators to report any crashes or other incidents that occur as their vehicles drive on public roads. NHTSA has learned of 22 incidents in which self-driving Waymo cars \u201cexhibited driving behavior that potentially violated traffic safety laws,\u201d according to a document posted online by NHTSA, including situations in which the vehicles \u201cappeared to disobey traffic safety control devices.\u201d In some cases, the vehicles collided with stationary objects such as gates and chains. This sometimes happened after the vehicles \u201cexhibited unexpected behaviors.\u2019 In some cases, the Waymo vehicle was driving entirely on its own, but in other cases the vehicle had a human in the driver\u2019s seat supervising its operation. In cases where the human driver was present, the Waymo vehicle\u2019s autonomous driving system was shut off moments before a collision. Information about the accidents was either reported to the NHTSA as required under federal regulations or was drawn from publicly available reports, according to NHTSA. \u201cAt Waymo we currently serve over 50 thousand weekly trips for our riders in some of the most challenging and complex environments,\u201d the company said in a statement emailed to CNN. \u201cWe are proud of our performance and safety record over tens of millions of autonomous miles driven, as well as our demonstrated commitment to safety transparency.\u201d Waymo is cooperating with NHTSA in the investigation, the company indicated in its statement. NHTSA is also investigating self-driving vehicles operated by Zoox, the autonomous technology subsidiary of Amazon. In two separate incidents, self-driving Toyota Highlanders operated by Zoox braked suddenly and unexpectedly, and then were rear-ended by motorcyclists. In one case, a motorcyclist was slightly injured in the crashes, in the other a Zoox safety driver was hurt. The NHTSA investigation will look into the Zoox self-driving system\u2019s \u201cbehavior in crosswalks around vulnerable road users, and in other similar rear-end collision scenarios.\u201d \u201cTransparency and collaboration with regulators is of the utmost importance, and we remain committed to working closely with NHTSA to answer their questions,\u201d a Zoox spokesperson said in an email.

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. They may be at the end of the alphabet, but Gen Z\u2019ers are pretty adept at pushing forward. What\u2019s happening: The economy hasn\u2019t been easy for the class of 2020 (and the years around it), but thankfully, it\u2019s getting much better. Those students who graduated from college during the global pandemic, the recession it induced and the topsy-turvy economic environment it left in its wake, have experienced a much faster bounce-back in the labor market and stronger wage growth than any recovery in recent history, according to new research by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI). The unemployment rate for recent college grads \u2014 workers between the ages of 21 and 24 \u2014 has recovered more than 2.5 times faster than in the aftermath of the Great Recession, researchers at the DC-based think tank found. And recent grads aren\u2019t just finding any job, they\u2019re finding good jobs. The underemployment rate for this cohort fully recovered just two years after the onset of the pandemic. On top of that, the report found, young grads  experienced inflation-adjusted wage growth for the first time this early in a recovery in at least three decades. The labor market for recent college grads is now stronger than it was before the pandemic, which EPI economists Katherine deCourcy and Elise Gould say \u201cwas a direct result of an aggressive fiscal policy response to the pandemic\u2019s economic shock.\u201d Those who graduated during the 2008-2009 recession, meanwhile, still haven\u2019t fully recovered from chronic underemployment. What it means: Millennials may never fully recoup the lost wages and career setbacks experienced during the Great Recession. Those who graduated around the 2008 recession earned less money than other graduates for at least 10 to 15 years, according to a study published by the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. That lack of earning power has delayed homebuying, marriage and child rearing for so-called recession millennials. Gen Z doesn\u2019t appear to be having that problem. That\u2019s likely a good thing for the strength of the consumer economy in the years to come. Not all is well: The EPI study found that racial and gender wage gaps still remain large among recent grads. On average, women are still paid $5.30 less per hour than their male counterparts, while Black and Hispanic workers are paid $3.24 and $2.07 less per hour than white workers, the research found. And Gen Z\u2019ers are taking on more debt than their millennial counterparts did at their age. It also might not last. Employers\u2019 hiring projections for the class of 2024 are down 5.8% year-over-year, according to a LinkedIn study released Monday. GameStop, AMC shares skyrocket after meme stock trader posts for first time in 3 years The surprise social media return of the trader who helped ignite the meme stock frenzy in 2021 sent GameStop shares skyrocketing Monday, reports my colleague Krystal Hur. The surge had nothing to do with the troubled company\u2019s fundamentals \u2014 and everything to do with a cartoon of a gamer that the trader Keith Gill, nicknamed Roaring Kitty, shared on X. GameStop shares surged 74% on Monday after the account run by Gill\u00a0shared a meme on X, marking its first post in three years. The shares skyrocketed by more than 110% earlier and were halted for volatility several times on Monday morning. Short sellers saw $1 billion in losses betting against GameStop on Monday, according to data company S3 Partners. Short-sellers aim to turn profits on a stock by borrowing shares, selling them and returning them after purchasing them at a lower price. Shares of AMC Entertainment, another meme stock, popped 78%. Reddit shares climbed roughly 9%. Shares of trading platform Robinhood Markets, which suspended purchases\u00a0of\u00a0GameStop,\u00a0AMC and other meme stocks during the frenzy in 2021, rose 4%. The image Gill posted depicts a man leaning forward in a chair with a video game controller in hand. GameStop had\u00a0posted the same cartoon in February, but with a blue arrow and chair. In Gill\u2019s cartoon, they are red. The meme is interpreted to convey, \u201cwhen things get serious,\u201d\u00a0according to Know Your Meme. Gill did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. GameStop shares tripped multiple circuit breakers \u2014 a temporary and mandated halt in trading to let investors cool off for a bit. Robinhood denied claims on social media on Monday that it had once again halted GameStop stock purchases on its platform. \u201cThis is incorrect. Robinhood has not shut down the purchase of Gamestop shares,\u201d Robinhood spokesperson Anupriya Ghate said in a statement to CNN. \u201cGME is seeing elevated volatility and movement, which triggers market-wide exchange trading limits and halts. These are market-wide and not specific to Robinhood.\u201d Shein promised to tackle overwork. A new report claims 75-hour weeks are still common More than a year after Shein promised to tackle excessive working hours in its supply chain,\u00a0a new report\u00a0suggests the Chinese fast-fashion company still has a problem. Workers\u00a0in some factories supplying\u00a0Shein are still working 75-hour weeks,\u00a0according to an investigation by Public Eye, a Swiss human rights advocacy group that first highlighted the alleged abuse back in 2021. \u201cThe 75-hour weeks that we found out about two years ago still seem to be common at Shein,\u201d the Swiss organization said. Public Eye interviewed 13 textile workers employed at six factories in Guangzhou, a region in southern China, last summer. It found that staff worked an average of 12 hours a day, excluding lunch and dinner breaks,\u00a0and\u00a0usually for six or seven days a week. Shein does not reveal the identity of its suppliers, Public Eye said in its report. The group said it established that the factories were Shein suppliers through interviewees\u2019 responses as well as the presence of Shein products. In a statement to CNN Shein said that it does \u201cnot recognize many of the allegations in (Public Eye\u2019s) report.\u201d \u201cThe Public Eye report is based on a sample of 13 interviewees and, though all voices in our supply chain are important, this small sample size should be seen in the context of our comprehensive ongoing process to continually improve our supply chain, which involves engaging with thousands of suppliers and workers within the supply chain,\u201d it added.

{"id": "2024_05_14_business_boeing-justice-department-criminal-prosecution", "text": "The US Justice Department on Tuesday notified Boeing that it breached terms of\u00a0its\u00a02021 agreement in which the company avoided criminal charges for two fatal 737 Max crashes. After a series of safety missteps earlier this year, including a door plug that blew off an Alaska Airlines flight shortly after takeoff in January, the Department of Justice said Boeing is now subject to criminal prosecution. \u201cFor failing to fulfill completely the terms of and obligations under the [deferred prosecution agreement], Boeing is subject to prosecution by the United States for any federal criminal violation of which the United States has knowledge,\u201d the Justice Department said in a letter to US District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor in Fort Worth, Texas, who oversaw the prior agreement. The Biden administration said in its letter that it has not yet determined how it will proceed, however, and Boeing will have an opportunity to respond to its breach of the agreement \u2013 and steps it has taken to remediate the situation \u2013 by June 13. It will let the court know by July 7 how it will proceed with the case. The notification comes as the Justice Department conducts a new investigation into Boeing\u2019s operations in the wake the door plug incident. The earlier deal had resolved a fraud investigation related to the company\u2019s development of its 737 Max aircraft. Under its deferred prosecution agreement from January 2021, Boeing paid $2.5 billion in penalties and promised to improve its safety and compliance protocols. Families of victims of the October 2018 Lion Air 737 Max crash and the March 2019 Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crash had long denounced the delayed prosecution agreement, arguing it denied them justice for the deaths of their loved ones. Families of victims and lawyers representing them met with the Justice Department late last month to persuade the Biden administration to end the agreement in light of multiple safety lapses at Boeing this year and in past years after the 2021 agreement was reached. Following the April 2024 meeting, attorney Paul Cassell, who represents the victims\u2019 families, said at a press conference that the deferred prosecution agreement was \u201crigged\u201d and brokered without families\u2019 say. Cassell pledged to hold Boeing accountable for its \u201cfraud and misconduct.\u201d On Tuesday, Cassell said, \u201cThis is a positive first step, and for the families, a long time coming. But we need to see further action from DOJ to hold Boeing accountable, and plan to use our meeting on May 31 to explain in more detail what we believe would be a satisfactory remedy to Boeing\u2019s ongoing criminal conduct.\u201d The Justice Department in its letter said it notified the families that Boeing breached its agreement, and it will continue to confer with families of the crash victims as well as other airline customers about next steps. The Department of Justice plans to meet with the families next on May 31. In Thursday\u2019s letter to the federal judge overseeing the prior agreement, the Justice Department said it had notified the company that \u201cthe government has determined that Boeing breached its obligations\u201d in multiple parts of the 2021 deal \u201cby failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the U.S. fraud laws throughout its operations.\u201d Boeing safety issues following its agreement Despite pledging to clean up its act, Boeing had a seemingly endless run of quality and safety lapses in the years since its deferred prosecution agreement. On September 20, 2021, just months after its agreement, Boeing disclosed it found\u00a0empty tequila bottles\u00a0inside one of the two 747 jets being refurbished for use as the next generation of Air Force One. In April 2023, Boeing announced its supplier used a \u201cnon-standard manufacturing process,\u201d delaying deliveries of the 737 Max. In February 2024, a month after the door plug incident, a preliminary National Transportation Safety Board investigation found that the plane left a Boeing factory missing the four bolts needed to secure the door plug. Later that month, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a report sharply\u00a0critical of the culture\u00a0at Boeing, citing \u201cgaps in Boeing\u2019s safety journey,\u201d and gave Boeing 90 days\u00a0to come up with a plan to fix its problems. Subsequent FAA reports found multiple problems\u00a0with Boeing\u2019s production practices following a six-week audit. In March, the FAA identified more\u00a0potential safety issues\u00a0with the engines of the 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner. Last month, the FAA announced an investigation into\u00a0a whistleblower\u2019s complaint\u00a0that the company took shortcuts when manufacturing its 777 and 787 Dreamliner jets and that those risks could become catastrophic as the airplanes age. The company disputed the complaint.

{"id": "2024_05_14_business_china-reaction-biden-tariffs", "text": "China has vowed to resolutely defend its interests in the face of huge new US tariffs and warned that the trade barriers would affect the wider relationship between the two economic superpowers. President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced that tariffs on $18 billion worth of imports of Chinese electric vehicles and an array of other products would soar over the next two years. The White House said the measures were designed to protect American workers and businesses in the face of China\u2019s unfair trade practices, including \u201cflooding global markets with artificially low-priced exports.\u201d China \u201cfirmly opposes\u201d the new tariffs, the country\u2019s Commerce Ministry said in a statement. \u201cThe increase in \u2026 tariffs by the United States contradicts President Joe Biden\u2019s commitment to \u2018not seek to suppress and contain China\u2019s development\u2019 and \u2018not to seek to decouple and break links with China,\u2019\u201d it said. \u201cThis action will seriously impact the atmosphere of bilateral cooperation.\u201d EVs imported from China will see their tariffs more than quadrupled from 27.5% to 100% \u2014 a policy lever meant to challenge Beijing\u2019s practice of encouraging aggressively low pricing by domestic EV manufacturers while levying a 40% tariff on US car imports. In addition to EVs, increased tariffs will apply to imports of Chinese steel and aluminum, legacy semiconductors, battery components, critical minerals, solar cells, cranes and medical products. Tariffs on solar cells and semiconductors will double to 50%, while the remainder of the targeted imports will attract tariffs of 25%. \u201cChina opposes the unilateral imposition of tariffs which violate (World Trade Organization) rules, and will take all necessary actions to protect its legitimate rights,\u201d Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters Tuesday shortly before the widely anticipated White House announcement. The Commerce Ministry said China would take resolute measures to defend its rights and interests and urged the Biden administration to \u201ccorrect its wrongdoing.\u201d China\u2019s global trade surplus in goods has soared in recent years and is now approaching $1 trillion, stoking tensions with the United States and Europe. The Biden administration and European Union officials fear Beijing is trying to tackle a subsidy-fueled overcapacity problem in its decelerating economy by dumping excess products on global markets. Leaders from the Group of Seven developed economies will discuss how to protect their industries at a summit next month. Responding to a separate question during the briefing, Wang added that the growth of China\u2019s new energy industry \u2014 including EVs, lithium batteries and photovoltaic products \u2014 is built on \u201ccontinued technical innovation, complete industrial and supply chains, and full-on market competition.\u201d \u201cOur leading edge is a result of comparative advantage and the rule of markets combined, not (of) subsidies,\u201d Wang said.

{"id": "2024_05_14_economy_ppi-wholesale-inflation-april", "text": "Americans already contending with persistent and stubbornly high inflation just got more unwelcome news on Tuesday: There are more price hikes likely coming down the pike. Wholesale inflation picked up in April to its highest rate in a year, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Tuesday. The Producer Price Index, which measures the change in prices that manufacturers pay to suppliers, was 2.2% for the 12 months ended in April, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Tuesday. That gain is higher than what was seen in March, which was downwardly revised from 2.1% to 1.8%. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.5%, a faster pace than March\u2019s 0.1% loss (also downwardly revised) and ran much hotter than what economists had anticipated. Economists were expecting a monthly gain of 0.3%, according to FactSet consensus estimates. \u201cThe concern here is that we now have a trend, an upward trend in producer prices, which can only be passed through to consumers and result in upward pressure on consumer price inflation over the coming months,\u201d Kurt Rankin, senior economist for the PNC Financial Services Group, told CNN in an interview. And that means interest rates will stay higher for longer and could further delay the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans for cuts on that front, he said. On Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said readings like the April PPI provide more justification to keep rates elevated for a longer period of time. But it does not necessarily mean the central bank will need to raise interest rates, Powell said while speaking at a Foreign Bankers Association event alongside European Central Bank Governing Council member Klaas Knot. Sticky, stubborn services inflation While higher energy costs (up 2% in April) helped to push goods prices higher, services inflation is what drove up the overall PPI last month. Nearly three-quarters of the April monthly gain was attributable to price hikes seen by producers of services, according to the report. Services providers saw a 0.6% increase in prices for the month, the fastest pace seen for that category since March 2022, Rankin noted. \u201cServices has been the issue over the past year as consumers continue to spend money, and costs for services-oriented businesses is still stronger than goods inflation; but goods producer prices are now also rising after having fallen through most of 2023,\u201d he said. PPI captures average price shifts before they reach consumers and serves as a potential bellwether for retail-level inflation in the months ahead. Although there was a welcome drop in food prices, which were down 0.7% for the month, April\u2019s data shows that activity upstream is looking quite a bit choppy. Even when excluding the volatile components of food and energy, \u201ccore\u201d PPI accelerated instead of slowing as economists had anticipated. The core index was up 2.4% for the 12 months ended in April \u2014 the highest annual rate since August of last year. On a monthly basis, core shot up 0.5% \u2014 well above estimates for a 0.2% increase. March\u2019s core PPI was revised down to show that prices fell 0.1% from March and rose 2.1% annually. \u201cToday\u2019s PPI number means inflation through June, July, August, is going to continue to have supply side pressure\u201d on businesses that deal more directly with consumers, Rankin said. \u201cNow those same businesses have their own costs to pass onto consumers, which compounds with continued strong consumer demand.\u201d The latest wholesale data is landing a day before an even more critical read on the state of inflation in the US: The Consumer Price Index for April will be released Wednesday morning.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/economy/ppi-wholesale-inflation-april/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_tech_google-ai-gmail-photos-developers-conference", "text": "A day after OpenAI impressed with a startlingly improved ChatGPT AI model, Google showed off an equally stunning vision for how AI will improve the products that billions of people use every day. The updates, announced at its annual Google I/O developer conference, come as the company is trying to push beyond its core advertising business with new devices and AI-powered tools. Artificial intelligence was so top of mind during the event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said at the end of the presentation the term \u201cAI\u201d was said 120 times \u2013 as counted by none other than its AI platform Gemini. During the keynote, Google showed how it wants its AI products to become a bigger part of users\u2019 lives, such as by sharing information, interacting with others, finding objects around the house, making schedules, shopping and using an Android device. Google essentially wants its AI to be part of everything you do. Pichai kicked off the event by highlighting various new features powered by its latest AI model Gemini 1.5 Pro. One new feature, called Ask Photos, allows users to search photos for deeper insights, such as asking when your daughter learned to swim or recall what your license plate number is, by looking through saved pictures. He also showed how users can ask Gemini 1.5 Pro to summarize all recent emails from your child\u2019s school by analyzing attachments, and summarizing key points and spitting out action items. Meanwhile, Google executives took turns demonstrating other capabilities, such as how the latest model could \u201cread\u201d a textbook and turn it into a kind of AI lecture featuring natural-sounding teachers that answer questions. Just one day before, OpenAI \u2014 one of the tech industry\u2019s leaders in artificial intelligence \u2014 unveiled a new AI model that it says will make chatbot ChatGPT smarter and easier to use. GPT-4o aims to turn ChatGPT into a digital personal assistant that can engage in real-time, spoken conversations and interact using text and \u201cvision.\u201d It can view screenshots, photos, documents or charts uploaded by users and have a conversation about them. Google also showed off Gemini\u2019s latest abilities to take different kinds of input \u2014 \u201cmultimodal\u201d capabilities to take in text, voice or images \u2014 as a direct response to ChatGPT\u2019s efforts. A Google executive also demoed a virtual \u201cteammate\u201d that can help stay on top of to-do lists, organize data and manage workflow. The company also highlighted search improvements by allowing users to ask more natural or more focused questions, and providing various versions of the responses, such as in-depth or summarized results. It can also make targeted suggestions, such as recommending kid friendly restaurants in certain locations, or note what might be wrong with a gadget, such as a camera, by taking a video of the issue via Google Lens. The goal is to take the legwork out of searching on Google, the company said. The company also briefly teased Project Astra, developed by Google\u2019s DeepMind AI lab, which will allow AI assistants to help users\u2019 everyday lives by using phone cameras to interpret information about the real world, such as identifying objects and even finding misplaced items. It also hinted at how it would work on augmented reality glasses. Google said that later this year it will integrate more AI functions into phones. For example, users will be able to drag and drop images created by AI into Google Messages and Gmail and ask questions about YouTube videos and PDFs on an Android device. And in a move that will likely appeal to many, a new built-in tool for Android will help detect suspicious activity in the middle of a call, such as a scammer trying to imitate a user\u2019s bank. According to analyst Jacob Bourne, from market research firm Emarketer, it\u2019s no surprise AI took center stage at this year\u2019s Google developer conference. \u201cBy showcasing its latest models and how they\u2019ll power existing products with strong consumer reach, Google is demonstrating how it can effectively differentiate itself from rivals,\u201d he said. He believes the reception of the new tools will be an indicator of how well Google can adapt its search product to meet the demands of the generative AI era. \u201cTo maintain its competitive edge and satisfy investors, Google will need to focus on translating its AI innovations into profitable products and services at scale,\u201d he said. As the company grows its AI footprint, it said it will introduce more protections to cut down on potential misuse. Google is expanding its existing SynthID feature to detect AI-generated content. Last year, the tool added watermarks to AI-generated images and audio. Google said it is also partnering with experts and institutions to test and improve the capabilities in its new models. Although the company has doubled down on artificial intelligence in the past year, it also met significant roadblocks. Last year, shortly after introducing its generative AI tool \u2014 then called Bard and since renamed Gemini \u2014 Google\u2019s share price dropped after a demo video of the tool showed it producing a factually inaccurate response to a question about the James Webb Space Telescope. More recently, the company hit pause in February on Gemini\u2019s ability to generate images of people after it was blasted on social media for producing historically inaccurate images that largely showed people of color in place of White people. Gemini, like other AI tools such as ChatGPT, is trained on vast troves of online data. Experts have long warned about the shortcomings around AI tools, such as the potential for inaccuracies, biases and the spreading of misinformation. Still, many companies are forging ahead on AI tools or partnerships. Apple may be interested in licensing and building Google\u2019s Gemini AI engine, which includes chatbots and other AI tools, into upcoming iPhones and its iOS 18 features, Bloomberg reported in March. The company is also reportedly talking to ChatGPT creator OpenAI.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/tech/google-ai-gmail-photos-developers-conference/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_media_nicholas-kristof-press-trump-democracy-threat", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. Famed\u00a0New York Times\u00a0journalist\u00a0Nicholas Kristof\u00a0on Tuesday will release his memoir,\u00a0\u201cChasing Hope: A Reporter\u2019s Life.\u201d\u00a0In the 432-page work, which I was provided an advanced copy of, Kristof vividly recounts some of the most pivotal experiences that have made up his decades as a reporter, foreign correspondent, bureau chief, and columnist for The Gray Lady. The book, of course, arrives as the American press still wrestles with how to cover\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0and the anti-democratic movement which he leads. Kristof, having spent years reporting on repressive governments across far-flung corners of the globe, is not shy about offering the lessons he has learned covering autocrats. The American press, he writes in clear-eyed terms, \u201cshouldn\u2019t be neutral about upholding democracy\u201d and must not \u201cdispassionately observe our way to authoritarianism.\u201d We spoke with Kristof over email for a Q&A about this and more. Our conversation is printed below in its unedited form. The opening scene of your memoir takes place in the Congo in 1997. You write that you thought you might lose your life on that reporting trip. At the end of your book, you write about how being a foreign correspondent has dramatically transformed as a profession. Today, you explain, foreign reporting trips are highly choreographed. The New York Times has its \u201cown James Bond-style Q\u201d who hands out special gear before heading into the field for trips and security consultants are there every step of the way. How beneficial have these resources been to journalism? They keep journalists alive. Look, in the old days, we just took off into war zones and sometimes got extraordinary stories by taking imprudent risks. I lost friends because of the risk-taking, and the reason I\u2019m able to write this answer for you is that I repeatedly was lucky. Early in the Iraq war, I calculated that journalists were dying proportionately at ten times the rate of American troops, because we weren\u2019t careful enough. When I last crossed into Syria during the civil war, I grumbled because the Times sent security consultants to escort me and they didn\u2019t let me sneak into Aleppo \u2014 but then journalists soon began to be kidnapped and tortured, so now I\u2019m very grateful to The Times for restraining me. My wife is even more grateful. In the 1980s, you write that as a reporter for The NYT you \u201chad a freedom that journalists today could barely fathom,\u201d in that \u201cmuch of the time, editors had little idea\u201d what you were working on. In your view, and broadly speaking, do reporters not have enough independence to go out into the world, find stories of importance and chase them? Is the 2024 journalist too chained to their desk? This is strange for a pundit to admit, but I think there\u2019s too much punditry in journalism today and not enough reporting. There can be a good audience for a political hit piece whipped out while sitting at a desk without actually talking to anyone, or for a talking head to do the same on television, but I deeply believe that where we in journalism most add value is when we go out and report; it\u2019s not when we stir the pot but when we add to the pot. I also think that\u2019s where we have the most impact. If I write about Trump, abortion, the Middle East, guns or other issues at the top of the agenda, fellow liberals will cheer me on, and conservatives will scoff \u2014 but I won\u2019t change minds. In contrast, where I\u2019ve been able to have an impact has always been by projecting issues onto the agenda. Darfur. Sex trafficking. Some human rights, poverty and health issues. And that happens only by getting out of the office and reporting. That\u2019s not just true of global crises. We\u2019re losing more than 100,000 Americans a year to overdoses, and I don\u2019t think we in journalism have adequately covered that catastrophe in working-class America. I think that\u2019s partly because of a lack of class diversity in our ranks. It\u2019s been a very difficult time to work as a journalist over the last few years. Scores of people have been laid off at nearly every major outlet, local newspapers have shuttered from coast-to-coast, and newsrooms continue to search for a viable economic model to remain operational into the future. You write in your book about how journalists should focus more on solutions. Is there a solution to these problems afflicting the industry that you see? I would never have imagined saying this a decade ago, but today I\u2019d be open to government grants to keep alive local news organizations around the country. The National Endowment for the Arts provides grants for local artists, and I\u2019d say that it\u2019s even more important that a town have a newspaper than that it have a theater. In terms of larger news organizations, philanthropy may be part of the answer. But I\u2019m deeply worried about what A.I. may do to the business model of news organizations. That\u2019s a shadow hanging over all of us. If we\u2019re not careful, down the road we won\u2019t be getting news from The New York Times, CNN or even TikTok, but from an A.I. assistant who pillages content from journalists and gives us a rehash that is tailor made to reinforce our own biases. As a foreign correspondent, you write openly about living with the consequences of having \u201coccasionally got[ten] sources in trouble\u201d when you perhaps were not careful enough. What advice might you offer journalists, particularly those reporting in countries ruled by oppressive leaders, so that they do not make such mistakes and live \u201chaunted by the fear\u201d that they may have \u201cinflicted suffering rather than alleviated it\u201d? Too many journalists aren\u2019t careful enough about protecting sources. The ethos in journalism has tended to be to provide as much description of a source as possible, and that makes sense in Washington. But with a Chinese person who may not understand the risk, I think we have a duty of care that may involve withholding part of someone\u2019s identity. When I\u2019m in China, there are armies of State Security people tailing me, using a zone-to-zone defense where they pass me from one person to the next, plus cameras on streets \u2014 and it\u2019s not a game. You make a mistake, and you destroy someone\u2019s life. One story I tell in \u201cChasing Hope\u201d is of a Chinese man who had information about missiles that I desperately wanted to get, and I met him secretly several time trying to wheedle the information out of him. \u00a0And by the end, I told him just to go home and never be in touch with a foreigner again. I knew that there was always some risk that I would get a great story, and he would be executed. It wasn\u2019t worth it. It felt strange to be turning away from a good story, but I\u2019m glad I did. You wanted to become governor of Oregon to change society for the better but were found ineligible to appear on the state\u2019s ballot over a residency requirement. You write in your book, however, that afterward you realized, \u201cPerhaps the grass is invariably greener on the other side of the fence.\u201d Do you believe that one can be more impactful working in journalism than politics? That\u2019s certainly true at times. William Safire, when asked if he would leave his Times column to be Secretary of State, replied: \u201cWhy take a step down?\u201d Look, there are great journalists and great politicians. I bellyflopped as a politician, so I\u2019m doing what I can with my keyboard. In the book, you write about efforts led by Donald Trump and his allies to \u201cundermine democracy.\u201d You offer a chilling description of what a \u201cpopulist authoritarianism\u201d might look like in the U.S., noting the federal government could be weaponized and \u201cused to punish or intimidate news organizations.\u201d You even write about how there could be \u201cassassinations\u201d that occur amid heightened polarization. As someone who has spent his entire life reporting across the world, do you believe that the American public truly understands the risks that you outline? Or do you believe that people are under the illusion such horrors cannot happen here? I\u2019ve seen how countries can unravel and how democracies can become more despotic, and I do think that many Americans don\u2019t appreciate the risks. We tend to think that change will be linear. Sometimes it zigs or zags. You write in your book that with so much at stake in 2024, \u201cJournalists must not settle for being dispassionate stenographers, quoting first one side and then the other.\u201d Instead, you say, \u201cOur foremost obligation is to report the truth, wherever it lies and whomever this offends. \u2026 We journalists shouldn\u2019t dispassionately observe our way to authoritarianism; we shouldn\u2019t be neutral about upholding democracy.\u201d Do you believe your colleagues in the press are as clear-eyed about this as you are? Some are and some aren\u2019t. Look, it\u2019s messy. Traditionally, we try to be fair and truthful. We aim to be fair by quoting all sides in a dispute, and most of the time that serves the interests of truth. But not always. During the Joe McCarthy period, it didn\u2019t work to quote McCarthy\u2019s rants and also the defenses of people he accused of being Communists; it took Edward R. Murrow to say clearly that McCarthy was a lying, bullying demagogue. Likewise, in the civil rights movement, it didn\u2019t work to quote Martin Luther King Jr. in one paragraph and George Wallace in the next. It took reporters going down South and, at considerable risk, conveying the brutality of Jim Crow segregation. Likewise, I think in 2016 we in the media treated Trump as just another candidate when, in my view, he was quite different. We were fair but perhaps not truthful, and I think our paramount responsibility is to convey the truths we know. But doing that with humility and effectiveness is really hard to pull off. Why do you believe that institutions and so many journalists find it difficult to flatly state that Trump is an anti-democratic candidate? I have enough trouble defining and defending my own square foot of principle. I won\u2019t try to speak for other journalists. I must ask: The NYT\u2019s top editor, Joe Kahn, recently drew backlash for saying, \u201cTo say that the threats of democracy are so great that the media is going to abandon its central role as a source of impartial information to help people vote \u2014 that\u2019s essentially saying that the news media should become a propaganda arm for a single candidate, because we prefer that candidate\u2019s agenda.\u201d What do you make of Kahn\u2019s comments? I think people are reading too much into a brief quote that can\u2019t encompass the complexity of running a newsroom today. I\u2019ve known Joe Kahn for 35 years, I admire him, and I believe in his commitment to accountability journalism \u2014 in China and in America. Will we periodically make mistakes? Of course. But The Times is an amazing institution that takes very seriously its responsibility to this country, to its democracy and to its future. Let\u2019s try to find a positive note to end on, amid all this doom and gloom. What gives you hope for the future of journalism? Bad journalism may never have been as bad as it is today, but great journalism has never been better. I\u2019m staggered by the brilliance of some of the multimedia, video and audio journalism I see today, by the dedication of colleagues to uncover the truth and by the courage of journalists risking their lives today in Gaza, Russia and elsewhere. The way photo journalists rush toward gunfire \u2014 it\u2019s poetry! I\u2019m awed by the caliber of young journalists flocking to the field even though we don\u2019t have a clear business model to provide them paychecks. And as I say in \u201cChasing Hope,\u201d journalism itself is an act of hope. We do what we do because we believe it makes a difference. What we do matters. I believe that journalism \u2014 along with law and the civil service \u2014 restrained the Trump presidency and is a force for civilization and democracy. When I was on Tiananmen Square that terrible night of June 3-4, 1989, as Chinese troops opened fire on us to crush the pro-democracy movement, a rickshaw driver picked up the body of a young man who had been shot. He drove his rickshaw by me, so that I could witness the broken, bleeding body and report on it. \u201cTell the world,\u201d the driver shouted, as tears streamed down his cheeks. \u201cTell the world.\u201d He believed that reporting mattered, that truth can eventually prevail, that what we do makes a difference. Some day, unpredictably, truth triumphs. He believed it and I believe it, and that is why I say that journalism is an act of hope.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/media/nicholas-kristof-press-trump-democracy-threat/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_02_28_tech_brain-implant-als-patient-bci", "text": "Staring at a computer screen, Mark focuses deeply, his\u202farms resting by his side. His right index finger trembles ever so slightly on top of a pillow, and then an alert rings out from the screen in front of him, a message to a caregiver that he needs assistance. Without ever clicking a mouse or touching a screen, Mark selected this command on his computer simply using signals from his brain. Mark, whom CNN agreed to identify using only his first name for privacy reasons, has an implant inside his brain that is translating his neural activity to commands on a computer. Mark is only the 10th person in the world implanted with this particular type of brain-computer interface, or BCI. He\u2019s participating in a human trial with a company called Synchron and underwent the procedure in August, after being diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis \u2013 sometimes called ALS or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease \u2013 in 2021. The hope is that the technology in Mark\u2019s brain could assist him and others like him who are losing their motor function. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for a piece of technology to help someone that will not be able to help themselves otherwise,\u201d Mark told CNN. Excitement around the potential for BCI technology has mounted over the past year, propelled in part by high-profile support from billionaire Elon Musk via his company Neuralink, as well as the recent publication of several promising studies from other players in the growing field. But the technology is far from mainstream, and efforts to commercialize it remain fraught with regulatory hurdles, ethics and privacy concerns. And the emerging technology itself faces numerous limitations. In other words, these procedures won\u2019t be coming to your local doctor\u2019s office anytime soon. Still, Mark says the opportunity to be at the forefront of testing this technology that could help others was important to him. Knowing that there is no cure for ALS, Mark says, signing up for the trial felt like a \u201cno-brainer\u201d to him. \u201cI figured I had two choices: I could wallow in self-pity, or I could pick myself up by the bootstraps and do what I could to help,\u201d Mark said. Creating a dictionary of the mind Relaxed and dressed in a light teal sweater, Mark offers no obvious physical indications that he has a BCI. He says he doesn\u2019t notice it, either. \u201cI have no sensation in my brain, that there\u2019s something there,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in an interview. Mark has two small scars, one on his right chest and one on his neck, but  no other visible indicators of a BCI. Synchron\u2019s brain implant, the one Mark has, is called a Stentrode and consists of a stent with electrode sensors that can detect electrical brain activity. Synchron patented the Stentrode, and the company was the first to receive approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to begin human trials for permanently implantable BCIs. Like a normal stent, it doesn\u2019t require open brain surgery. Instead, it\u2019s able to travel through the body\u2019s natural network of veins, so the entry point was Mark\u2019s jugular vein.\u202fHis surgeon threaded the device through the blood vessels all the way to the top of his brain, where it sits in the sagittal sinus, one of the brain\u2019s main veins, cradled in the motor cortex, the part of the brain responsible for movement. Whether it\u2019s shaking hands or taking a step, every action a person does is associated with a specific electrical signature from their brainwaves. The Stentrode learns to recognize those electrical patterns and creates a personalized dictionary of movement. There may be a general electrical signature for different movements, but each person\u2019s will vary slightly, making the device highly personalized. When Mark thinks about a certain movement, like clicking somewhere on a computer screen, the Stentrode reads that brain signal and recognizes the intended movement. Then that message travels via a very thin cable to an internal transmitter, similar to a pacemaker, that was surgically implanted in his chest. So much data travels from Mark\u2019s brain to the transmitter that it has to be wired to a computer.\u00a0That external transmitter sits right above the internal transmitter and carries the signal from Mark\u2019s brain to the computer almost instantaneously. At the moment, Mark has to be wired to the computer to use the device. However, the goal is that the next-generation devices will eventually have a wireless process, so a patient would need only the Stentrode and the transmitter inside the chest. Coming to terms with an ALS diagnosis Mark first noticed that something wasn\u2019t quite right in 2020. He couldn\u2019t snap his fingers or make a pinching motion with his left hand; he also noticed some visible muscle atrophy.\u00a0\u201cAnd then I dropped a cup of coffee,\u201d he recalls. At age 63, Mark\u2019s diagnosis was official: He had ALS, a disease with which most people are only expected to live three to five years after symptoms develop. \u201cIt was a hard pill to swallow,\u201d he admits. \u201cI still consider myself young.\u201d He had a job he loved and was going to retire soon. He also has a family, including two daughters and one granddaughter. Despite the diagnosis and weakness in his arm, Mark continued to work at his job at a wholesale floral company. Lifting buckets of water and boxes of flowers, however, soon became too difficult. Then driving became difficult. By December 2022, he stopped driving altogether. There was an emotional toll to ALS too as Mark started to lose his independence. \u201cI lived alone for 13 years, so I was used to doing everything by myself,\u201d he said. He eventually moved in with his brother and his brother\u2019s family. Today, his voice is strong, and he can still walk, but he says he has to use a foot-controlled feeder to eat because of the loss of strength in his arms. Mark is still able to make some very limited movements with his hands, but he\u2019s lost most of the dexterity in his fingers \u2013 meaning he can\u2019t pick up a pencil or scroll on his phone. Mark hopes the BCI can help him with tasks like accessing his phone. But Mark didn\u2019t lose hope that he could still find a way to help others. He enrolled in a drug trial, and when that ended, he immediately asked his doctor what else he could do that was \u201cnew and exciting.\u201d That\u2019s when he found himself in this feasibility trial with Synchron and the BCI. After his device was implanted in August, his ability to use his BCI wasn\u2019t immediate, something that frustrated him. It took about two months for his recovery, including waiting for the swelling from the pacemaker-like device to go down, before the Synchron team could even turn the implant on. But he remembers the first time it did work. \u201cThere was a few cheers,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe\u2019d been trying and trying, and it was not working so good, and then it finally worked.\u201d For the past three months, Mark has been working with Maria Nardozzi, an occupational therapist from Synchron. As he masters each task, he builds up that dictionary of movement that the device uses to read his brainwaves and translate them into actions on the computer. So far, Mark has mastered a program that allows him to send a health notification or a pain report to his provider if needed. His immediate goals are to be able to control his Alexa and turn on Netflix, as well as to learn how to text. \u201cText messaging is a really critical element of how we communicate with our family and friends now,\u201d said Stentrode developer Dr. Tom Oxley, the CEO of Synchron. \u201cSo that\u2019s usually what people mostly want back.\u201d Oxley said he has seen some patients with stentrodes able to type between five and 10 words per minute already, a notable achievement if you consider that most people can text between five and 20 words per minute. Mark has also used the device to play a \u201cPong\u201d-like table tennis video game. He describes the feeling of using the device as his brainwaves\u00a0contracting and then relaxing. Each move he wants to make on the computer has a focused, intentional thought. If he doesn\u2019t want the bar to move, he must relax. The process of training the device takes patience, Mark said, but he\u2019s excited to help his doctors and the Synchron team learn along with him. \u201cSometimes it doesn\u2019t work like we want,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of being involved in a study is we\u2019re here to learn, we\u2019re here to further the technology.\u201d The rise and race for BCI technology Although still far from mainstream, the potential of BCI technology has spurred the emergence of a handful of companies racing to develop this futuristic health tech. Two separate studies published in the journal Nature in August showed how brain implants using artificial intelligence technology empowered paralyzed patients to communicate by translating neural signals into text or speech via an avatar at a speed not previously achieved by this type of technology. And investors are showing strong appetite for the neurotech startups and companies working in the BCI arena. Synchron has raised about $145 million since its inception, the company said in a statement in December 2022. Musk\u2019s Neuralink has raised more than $323 million, according to a regulatory filing last year with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cThey\u2019re all a bit different,\u201d Oxley, the neurologist and CEO of Synchron, told CNN of the major players in the BCI field right now. Musk, especially, has \u201cshined a big light onto the field\u201d with his involvement in Neuralink, Oxley said. Ultimately, Oxley added, \u201ccompetition is good.\u201d As a result, he said, we will probably see many \u201cdifferent types of technologies come through for different use cases.\u201d As the race to commercialize BCI heats up, policymakers are taking notice. A United Nations body convened a conference with politicians and stakeholders in July at UNESCO\u2019s Paris headquarters to discuss the ethics of the emerging neurotechnology. The conference concluded with calls for a comprehensive framework to harness the potential and address the risks. \u201cNeurotechnology is advancing at warp speed,\u201d Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, said at the event. \u201cThis progress is a cause for celebration \u2013 and a reason for caution. We must safeguard ethical standards and ensure the full protection of human rights.\u201d Musk\u2019s involvement has fueled controversy. The billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has made bold claims about BCI\u2019s potential to solve a range of complex problems. Neuralink made international headlines this year when Musk said in a post on X that the company had implanted a chip in a human brain \u2013 though he did not share many other details.\u00a0Earlier this month, Musk also said Neuralink\u2019s first human trial participant\u00a0can control a computer mouse\u00a0with their brain.\u00a0Neuralink received FDA clearance for human clinical trials in May. Neuralink came under fire in 2022 for its treatment of monkeys during testing. The company acknowledged that a monkey died during an attempt to get the animal to play a video game like \u201cPong.\u201d Current and former employees of Neuralink at the time accused the company of rushing to market, according to Reuters, resulting in careless animal deaths. Hope for the future and a chance for a full life now There are still a lot of things Mark can do on his own. He can walk and speak and retains some movement in his limbs. But in the few years since his ALS diagnosis, Mark says, he has already noticed a loss in dexterity. The BCI provides Mark with hope that he can make a difference for other people in the future and a chance to continue living a full life now. If he wants to access Audible, his favorite app, he has to have someone lay his phone flat in front of him so he can select the app. He hopes that eventually, his implant can help him have easier access to his audiobooks and help with other daily tasks, even control his robotic feeder, which he currently powers with his foot. \u201cThis, to me, is an opportunity to be able to do those tasks without the use of my arm,\u201d he said. Ultimately, Mark said, he hopes that his involvement in this study will also provide hope for others. He said this was his main reason for participating in the trial. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to maybe help myself,\u201d Mark said. \u201cBut more importantly, I think, to help other individuals.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/02/28/tech/brain-implant-als-patient-bci/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_20_investing_microsoft-stock-record-high-altman-openai", "text": "Microsoft stock reached a record high on Monday after the company said that Sam Altman, former chief executive of OpenAI, will join the company to head its artificial intelligence innovation leg. Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing. Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive. Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year. The stock is one of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that have powered the lion\u2019s share of the market\u2019s returns this year, boosted by Wall Street\u2019s bet that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in tech.

{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture.

Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

TAGeX Brands is conducting an online auction of Red Lobster restaurant inventory, including kitchen equipment, furniture, tables and chairs. The auction begins Monday and continues through Thursday, according to company founder Neal Sherman. Red Lobster locations in Buffalo, Orlando, Jacksonville and other cities were listed as \u201ctemporarily closed\u201d on Red Lobster\u2019s website, according to local news reports. Red Lobster did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. The company has around 650 locations. Red Lobster is\u00a0reportedly\u00a0considering filing for bankruptcy protection. The chain has tapped a restructuring expert as its chief executive, a possible indicator of an impending bankruptcy. The mass closures are another sign of problems at Red Lobster and one of the only times in its more than 50-year history the chain has closed dozens of stores at once. Red Lobster was a casual dining pioneer, bringing affordable seafood to middle-class consumers for the first time. But the chain has declined in recent years due to a range of factors, including corporate mismanagement, say former leaders and restaurant analysts. In 2020, Thai Union, a longtime supplier to Red Lobster, took an undisclosed financial stake in the chain, becoming a key shareholder. Under Thai Union\u2019s direction, Red Lobster has cycled through four CEOs and an all-you-can-eat shrimp deal last year that slowed down table service and cut into Thai Union\u2019s profitability. The promotion\u00a0has been a tradition at the chain for more than 18 years, but Red Lobster made\u00a0endless shrimp a permanent fixture on the menu. \u201cWe need to be much more careful,\u201d Thai Union CEO Thiraphong Chansiri said in November of the shrimp deal. Thai Union said earlier this year it would divest from Red Lobster and take a $530 million loss on its investment. \u201cI\u2019m going to stop eating lobster,\u201d Chansiri said. The explosive growth and popularity of fast-casual chains like Chipotle and quick-service chains like Chick-fil-A over the past two decades also squeezed Red Lobster and the casual dining sector. Casual dining has slipped from 36% of total restaurant industry sales in 2013 to 31% in 2023, according to Technomic, a restaurant research firm.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/business/red-lobster-is-abruptly-closing-dozens-of-restaurants/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_tech_aws-ceo-adam-selipsky-steps-down", "text": "Amazon\u2019s biggest moneymaker, Amazon Web Services, is getting a new leader. Adam Selipsky, the chief executive of the cloud computing unit, will step down from his role next month, the company announced Tuesday. Selipsky, who first joined AWS in 2005 \u2014 before its services were even publicly available \u2014 has led the business since 2021, when previous AWS CEO Andy Jassy was promoted to lead all of Amazon. Matt Garman, currently vice president of sales, marketing and global services, will take over as AWS CEO starting June 3. The leader of AWS is of major consequence to the larger company, as the cloud computing business makes up nearly two-thirds of Amazon\u2019s overall profits. And with annual revenue of more than $90 billion last year, AWS is larger than many standalone companies. AWS is also at a pivotal moment with the growth of artificial intelligence, as it rolls out new tools and capacity in hopes of becoming the computing provider of choice for the next wave of technology. But it faces fierce competition from other major players, including Google Cloud and Microsoft\u00a0Azure. Amazon Web Services\u2019 sales have grown more than 85% since Selipsky\u2019s takeover. Amazon shares dipped more than 1% Tuesday following the announcement. However, Jassy said in an email to staff Tuesday that Selipsky\u2019s tenure was always meant to be short-lived. Jassy said that when he left AWS to become Amazon CEO, \u201cwe had strong leaders in AWS, several of whom could lead the overall business in the long-term, but who\u2019d benefit from a few more years gaining experience and learning under a more seasoned CEO.\u201d He added that in speaking with Selipsky about taking the job back in 2021, \u201cwe agreed that if he accepted the role, he\u2019d likely do it for a few years, and that one of the things he\u2019d focus on during that time was helping prepare the next generation of leadership. We were fortunate that Adam agreed to step in and lead AWS, and has deftly led the business, while also developing his leadership team,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cI\u2019m humbled by the many customers who have said they wouldn\u2019t be what they are without AWS, thankful to our many partners, and grateful to my passionate and innovative teammates. AWS will be in great hands with Matt and the incredible leadership team,\u201d Selipsky said in a post on X Tuesday. Even before Selipsky\u2019s takeover, Garman had been considered by analysts to be among the top frontrunners for AWS CEO. Garman started at Amazon as an intern in 2005, and joined full-time in 2006 as one of the first AWS product managers, according to the company. He later became general manager of AWS Compute services, before moving to lead the sales side of the business.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/tech/aws-ceo-adam-selipsky-steps-down/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_investing_gamestop-roaring-kitty", "text": "The surprise social media return of the trader who helped ignite the meme stock frenzy in 2021 sent GameStop shares skyrocketing Monday. The surge had nothing to do with the troubled company\u2019s fundamentals \u2014 and everything to do with a cartoon of a gamer that the trader, nicknamed Roaring Kitty, shared on X. GameStop shares surged 74% on Monday after the account run by Keith Gill shared a meme on X, marking its first post in three years. The shares skyrocketed by more than 110% earlier and were halted for volatility several times on Monday morning. Short sellers have seen $1 billion in mark-to-market losses betting against GameStop on Monday, according to data company S3 Partners. Short-sellers aim to turn profits on a stock by borrowing shares, selling them and returning them after purchasing them at a lower price. Shares of AMC Entertainment, another meme stock, popped 78%. Reddit shares climbed roughly 9%. Shares of trading platform Robinhood Markets, which suspended purchases\u00a0of\u00a0GameStop,\u00a0AMC and other meme stocks during the frenzy in 2021, rose 4%. The image Gill posted depicts a man leaning forward in a chair with a video game console in hand. GameStop had posted the same cartoon in February, but with a blue arrow and chair. In Gill\u2019s cartoon, they are red. The meme is interpreted to convey, \u201cwhen things get serious,\u201d according to Know Your Meme. Gill did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. GameStop shares tripped multiple circuit breakers \u2014 a temporary and mandated halt in trading to let investors cool off for a bit. Robinhood denied claims on social media on Monday that it had once again halted GameStop stock purchases on its platform. \u201cThis is incorrect. Robinhood has not shut down the purchase of Gamestop shares,\u201d Robinhood spokesperson Anupriya Ghate said in a statement to CNN. \u201cGME is seeing elevated volatility and movement, which triggers market-wide exchange trading limits and halts. These are market-wide and not specific to Robinhood.\u201d Who is Roaring Kitty? Gill, who goes by \u201cDeepf\u2014-ingvalue\u201d on Reddit, was one of the leading forces on the WallStreetBets subreddit that drove eye-popping returns in GameStop\u2019s stock. The traders bid up shares of the retailer, targeting short sellers. The retail investors sent other stocks soaring in 2021, including AMC Entertainment and Bed Bath & Beyond. They are now collectively known as meme stocks, or shares of companies with a cult following that see wide swings based on their popularity among trader communities on social media rather than their fundamentals. Gill described himself as a casual daytime trader in testimony during a 2021 Congressional hearing on the GameStop mania. He has said he did not set out to help stoke the GameStop frenzy and instead believed that the stock was an attractive opportunity for investors. \u201cThe idea that I used social media to promote GameStop stock to unwitting investors is preposterous,\u201d Gill said in written testimony.\u00a0\u201cI was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only. \u2026 Whether other individual investors bought the stock was irrelevant to my thesis.\u201d Gill also said that he first purchased GameStop stock, and later call options, in the summer of 2019, when the stock was trading around $5 apiece. He added to his position through the rest of the year and 2020, and testified that he believed \u201cthe market remains oblivious to GameStop\u2019s unique opportunity.\u201d But even he didn\u2019t believe it would hit a high of $483 a share in 2021. \u201cAt the time I thought it was possible but a very low probability,\u201d Gill testified. Gill was a main character in the 2023 movie \u201cDumb Money\u201d (played by actor Paul Dano), which portrays the events leading up to and during the GameStop short squeeze.

{"id": "2024_05_09_tech_china-qu-jing-baidu-pr-backlash-hnk-intl", "text": "A Chinese tech executive has ignited outrage in China with her fiery endorsement of toxic workplace culture, which eventually caused her to lose her own job. Qu Jing,\u00a0the\u00a0former vice president and head of communications\u00a0at Baidu, often dubbed China\u2019s equivalent to Google, sparked a public relations crisis for the Chinese search engine after her controversial comments hit a raw nerve with young workers fed up with grueling hours and relentless pressure. In a series of short videos posted last week on Douyin, China\u2019s version of TikTok, Qu spoke about her devotion to her career, strict management style and unflagging demands on her direct reports. In one video, she lashed out at an employee who refused to go on a 50-day business trip during the Covid-19 pandemic, when China imposed stringent travel restrictions and quarantines. \u201cWhy should I take my employee\u2019s family into consideration? I\u2019m not her mother-in-law,\u201d Qu said. \u201cI\u2019m 10 years, 20 years older than you. I didn\u2019t feel bitter about it or tired, even though I have two children. Who are you to tell me that your husband can\u2019t stand it?\u201d In another clip, Qu shared her personal sacrifices as a working mother. She was working so hard that she forgot her elder son\u2019s birthday and what grade her younger son was in at school. She said she didn\u2019t regret it because she \u201cchose to become a career woman.\u201d \u201cIf you work in public relations, don\u2019t expect weekends off,\u201d she said in a third video.\u00a0\u201cKeep your phone on 24 hours a day, always ready to respond.\u201d In another video, she also threatened to retaliate against employees who complain about her, saying they wouldn\u2019t get another job in the industry. The\u00a0American Psychological Association\u00a0describes \u201ctoxic workplace\u201d as an environment filled with infighting, intimidation and other affronts that harm productivity. Following the public outcry, Qu has lost her own job at Baidu (BIDU), a person familiar with the matter told CNN on condition of anonymity. CNN has also seen a screenshot of an internal personnel system that appears to confirm she no longer works at the company. Baidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment. By Thursday night, Qu had removed the title of \u201cBaidu\u2019s vice president\u201d from her account on Douyin. Qu had apologized earlier in the day and said her posts did not speak for Baidu. \u2018Lack of empathy\u2019 The controversy soon became a trending topic on Douyin and Weibo, China\u2019s X-like platform, dominating online discussions. Users\u00a0criticized Qu for her aggressive and insensitive approach and accused her, and Baidu, of\u00a0promoting a toxic workplace. \u201cIn her voice and in her tone, there\u2019s deep indifference to and lack of empathy for the common plight of her colleagues,\u201d said Ivy Yang, a China tech analyst and founder of consulting firm Wavelet Strategy. \u201cA lot of what she said really struck a nerve, because people feel that in their own workplaces very often. The fact that she said it in a way that\u2019s so direct and\u00a0in your face, it just generated this kind of emotional response,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is what the bosses are thinking, and she was merely saying it out aloud,\u201d Yang added. China\u2019s young workers have increasingly spoken out against\u00a0the culture of excessive overwork and extreme competitiveness\u00a0that has come to dominate many industries, especially the tech sector. In 2019, Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma drew intense criticism after endorsing the \u201c996\u201d trend, meaning working from 9am to 9pm six days a week, and calling it a \u201chuge blessing.\u201d Yang called the backlash against Ma a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d that led people to rethink the relationship between the workplace and themselves \u2014\u00a0a trend that has only intensified as the Chinese economy slows. China\u2019s economy grew stronger than expected at the start of this year, but problems \u2014 including a\u00a0property crisis, declining\u00a0foreign investment\u00a0and\u00a0tepid consumption\u00a0\u2014 are piling up. \u201cWhen companies demand complete loyalty, time and energy from their employees, employees feel there\u2019s no reciprocity or reward for their sacrifice or contribution, especially when things are slowing down. That becomes the central conflict, and this conflict is also at the heart of the Baidu saga,\u201d Yang added. As public anger mounted, the videos posted on Qu\u2019s personal Douyin account were taken down. \u2018Inappropriate points\u2019 After days of silence, Qu apologized on Thursday for \u201ccausing such a big storm\u201d in a post on her personal account on WeChat, China\u2019s most popular social media app. \u201cI have carefully read all the opinions and comments from various platforms, and many criticisms are very pertinent. I deeply reflect on and humbly accept them,\u201d Qu wrote. She also sought to put distance between her remarks and Baidu, saying she had not sought approval beforehand and that they did not represent the company\u2019s stance. \u201cThere were many inappropriate and unsuitable points made in the videos, which led to misunderstandings about the company\u2019s values and culture, causing serious harm,\u201d Qu wrote. A person familiar with the matter said Qu\u2019s clips were part of her push to amplify Baidu\u2019s voice on short video platforms, which have become an increasingly important channel for information dissemination in China. Qu had asked all members of the PR team to create their personal accounts, according to the person, who requested anonymity. \u201cThe main purpose is to improve everyone\u2019s ability to make short videos. Everyone can have different options over the content, and Cristina chose to speak about her personal experience,\u201d said the person, referring to Qu\u2019s English name. Qu worked as a reporter for China\u2019s state news agency Xinhua before switching to the PR industry. She joined Baidu in 2021 from Huawei, a Chinese tech giant known for its hard-charging \u201cwolf culture,\u201d where employees are expected to emulate wolves\u2019 bloodthirsty nature, fearlessness and resilience. Ren Zhengfei, the founder of Huawei, has previously\u00a0said in interviews that its corporate culture was misunderstood. \u201cWolf culture,\u201d\u00a0he has said,\u00a0meant \u201csensitivity, team spirit and resilience\u201d and that the company didn\u2019t have a \u201c996 culture.\u201d A former Baidu employee said Qu brought Huawei\u2019s \u201caggressive\u201d corporate culture with her to Baidu. \u201c(She triggered) a pretty big culture shock. About 60% of the team left within months of her arrival,\u201d the former employee told CNN on the condition of anonymity. The PR team is expected to always be available, keep their phones on, reply to messages immediately and attend meetings at midnight and on weekends with short notice, the former employee said. Qu also adopted the military-style language used in corporate management at Huawei, requiring the team to be \u201cdisciplined\u201d and \u201cable to win battles,\u201d the former employee said. CNN has reached out to Huawei for comment.

{"id": "2024_05_09_tech_meta-child-safety-investigation-arrests-new-mexico", "text": "An investigation by the New Mexico Attorney General into the potential dangers of Meta\u2019s platforms has resulted in the arrests of three men charged with attempted sexual abuse of children. The arrests came after a months-long investigation by the attorney general\u2019s office into the risks of sexual exploitation of children on Facebook and Instagram. That investigation also formed the basis of a lawsuit against Meta, filed in December, accusing the tech giant of creating a \u201cbreeding ground\u201d for child predators. Meta has pushed back against the claims in the lawsuit and says it offers dozens of safety tools for children and parents. As part of the investigation, the attorney general\u2019s office created multiple fake Facebook and Instagram profiles posing as children, which the suit alleges were served sexually suggestive content and, in some cases, were urged by other users to send pornographic content of themselves. The fake child accounts were also allegedly contacted and solicited for sex by the three New Mexico adult men whose arrests were announced by the attorney general on Wednesday. Two of the three men were arrested at a motel, where they allegedly believed they would be meeting up with a 12-year-old girl, based on their conversations with the decoy accounts. \u201cThis is (Meta CEO) Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s fault,\u201d New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said in a press conference announcing the arrests Wednesday. \u201cThis is the fault of a company that has extraordinary resources at its disposal and has chosen time and again to place profits over the interests of children.\u201d A Meta spokesperson told CNN that \u201cchild exploitation is a horrific crime and we\u2019ve spent years building technology to combat it and to support law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting the criminals behind it.\u201d \u201cThis is an ongoing fight, where determined criminals evolve their tactics across platforms to try and evade protections,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe use sophisticated technology, hire child safety experts, report content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and share information and tools with other companies and non-profits to help root out predators across the many platforms they use.\u201d News of the arrests could add to the growing scrutiny that Meta \u2013 like other social media companies \u2013 faces over the safety of young users on its platforms. Lawmakers, parents and online safety advocates, as well as several separate lawsuits, have raised concerns about the impact of Meta\u2019s platforms on teens\u2019 mental health, body image and overall wellbeing. In January, Zuckerberg apologized to families who said their children had been harmed by using social media during a Senate committee hearing about online youth safety. In January \u2014 after Torrez\u2019s lawsuit was filed and ahead of the Senate hearing \u2014 Meta rolled out\u00a0additional youth safety features, including\u00a0updating teens\u2019 default privacy settings\u00a0to restrict anyone they don\u2019t follow from messaging them, including other teens. The move came after Meta in 2021\u00a0restricted adults\u00a0over age 19 from messaging teens who don\u2019t follow them. The company also said in December that it had launched technology to proactively detect and disable accounts displaying suspicious behaviors and that it formed a Child Safety Task Force. But Torrez said during Wednesday\u2019s press conference that the arrests underscore the ongoing, real-world risks to children from Meta\u2019s platforms. One of the New Mexico men arrested this week, 52-year-old Fernando Clyde, allegedly added one of the attorney general\u2019s fake child Facebook accounts as a friend and initiated a conversation in February. \u201cThroughout the conversation Fernando sent pictures of his genitals and spoke to her about having sex,\u201d a press release from the attorney general\u2019s office states. Clyde is charged with one count of child solicitation by electronic communication device of a child under 13 and one of attempted criminal sexual penetration of a minor. The second man, 29-year-old Marlon Kellywood, faces the same charges. Attorneys for Clyde and Kellywood could not immediately be reached for comment. The third man, 47-year-old Christopher Reynolds, was arrested and charged with one count of child solicitation by electronic communication device of a child under 13 after police were tipped off by a mother whose 11-year-old had allegedly received messages from him. Investigators then friended him from the fake child account, and Reynolds initiated a conversation and sent sexually explicit messages, according to the attorney general\u2019s office. Reynolds\u2019 attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \u201cThe decoy accounts with which these suspects engaged mirror the experience children can and are having on these platforms,\u201d Torrez said in a press release. He added that the investigation indicates \u201cthat using Meta\u2019s social media platforms not only endangers children in the virtual world but, more importantly, they are spaces that sexual predators actively use to hunt, groom and victimize children in the real world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/tech/meta-child-safety-investigation-arrests-new-mexico/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_business_taylor-swift-europe-ticket-prices", "text": "Planning a summer vacation in Europe usually requires an exorbitant amount of cash, but when Taylor Swift is involved, it actually might be a deal. Fans looking to snag tickets to the European leg of her popular \u201cEras Tour\u201d are finding it substantially cheaper to see Swift overseas \u2014 even with flights and hotels factored in \u2014 thanks in part to a historically strong dollar and strict European Union regulations placed on ticket resellers that make, in the words of Swift herself, anything but a cruel summer. Jacking up prices on the European secondary market is \u201cconsidered a predatory activity that reduces consumer choice and exploits consumers by charging them way higher prices than the event organizers actually intended,\u201d Sam Shemtob, managing director for ticket resale advocacy group Face-value European Alliance for Ticketing (FEAT), told CNN. For example, secondary market ticket prices for Swift\u2019s show in Stockholm, Sweden, this Saturday are as cheap as $300 for standing room-only and seats in the nosebleed sections. Prices are just a few hundred more in prime seating locations at Friends Arena, home of the Swedish men\u2019s national football team. Planning a last-minute trip is more expensive compared to planning months ahead, but there are some affordable ways to get to Sweden: A roundtrip flight from New York (with a connection) are running about $700 and rates at 4-star hotel about $300, according to Kayak. Altogether, that\u2019s about $1,300 before food and beverage is factored in. Compare that to Swift\u2019s show in Miami in October where seats are selling for about $2,000 to as much as $8,500 on StubHub. Prices for her other two US shows in New Orleans and Indianapolis are roughly the same. Sweden isn\u2019t the only budget-friendly city: Prices for Swift\u2019s stops in Portugal, Spain and Germany in the coming months can be purchased as cheap as $300 to $400 a ticket \u2014 substantially cheaper the average resale price of $1,600 during her US dates last year. Although Europe\u2019s laws on ticket resale vary country by country, a number of them, including Ireland and Portugal, ban ticket sellers from making a profit on the secondary market. In France, reselling is banned unless authorized by the promoter, Shemtob said. The EU also recently implemented the Digital Services Act for ticket resale marketplaces that \u201censure professional sellers are identifiable, prevent certain manipulative sales tactics, and require regular reporting to improve transparency for consumers,\u201d according to FEAT, which lobbied for the law. Shemtob said the difference in pricing between the US and EU is because the former treats \u201cevent tickets like commodities that can be bought or sold according to market prices, but the European Court of Justice has ruled that a \u2018dated event ticket\u2019 is a contract between the organizer and the consumer enabling entry under specific terms and conditions \u2014 not a commodity that can just be bought and sold.\u201d Plus, American tourists are finding their money going further: The US\u00a0dollar index, which measures the currency\u2019s strength against six of its peers, closed last month at its highest level since last November. Although it has faded since April, it\u2019s still strong. For Swifties looking to jump over the pond for their London Boy, Shemtob recommends using ticket sellers such as Ticketmaster, AEG, Eventim or Twickets. He added also be \u201cextremely wary of using internet search, because the predatory resale platforms all pay top dollar to have their listings appear at the top of search results.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/business/taylor-swift-europe-ticket-prices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_economy_inflation-new-china-tariffs-biden-example", "text": "Countries have long imposed tariffs as a means of protecting and shoring up domestic industries. However, history and research have shown that the economic effects often fail to live up to the hype. On Tuesday, the Biden administration announced the latest iteration of American import taxes: a wave of new and heightened tariffs on Chinese exports across a slew of industries deemed strategic to national security. Economists expect that the newly announced $18 billion in tariffs likely will have a minimal near-term impact on GDP, inflation and monetary policy \u2014 some equating it to a mere \u201crounding error.\u201d However, on a broader level, the picture could be more complex. \u201cThe tariffs announced on China by the Biden administration foreshadow what is going to be a long, cold winter of economic conflict between the US and China,\u201d economist Joe Brusuelas at RSM US told CNN. The latest tariffs build upon former President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping $300 billion program in 2018 and 2019, which levied tariffs heavily against China and a variety of other trading partners and is still in effect. Trump has made campaign trail promises for even steeper tariffs if he were elected \u2014 not just for China but an across-the-board 10% tariff on all imports, which economists have said would not only result in significant job losses in the US but also stoke inflation. Economic growth, inflation and the Fed The latest tariffs, which would roll out some time between\u00a0now\u00a0and 2026, come amid a solid job market, robust economic growth and strong consumer spending \u2014 but also a continuing battle against decades-high\u00a0inflation\u00a0that is keeping interest\u00a0rates\u00a0higher. Biden\u2019s tariff plan likely won\u2019t move the needle for monetary policy, said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. \u201cThe additional tariffs are essentially a rounding error for inflation and GDP, carrying no implications for monetary policy,\u201d Sweet wrote in a note issued Monday, when reports first indicated that changes to the US tariff policy were forthcoming. \u201cThe Fed will not make a mountain out of a mole hill, so the tariffs will not provide additional ammunition to justify keeping interest rates high for longer.\u201d On Tuesday, after learning the fuller scope of the Biden administration\u2019s tariffs, Sweet told CNN those expectations shouldn\u2019t change significantly. Domestic manufacturing In 2002, when President George W. Bush placed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum products, studies show that while it only cost the economy $30 million, it resulted in higher prices for American steel-consuming industries and led to a steep loss of jobs throughout the steel industry, especially among smaller firms that didn\u2019t have the market power to influence prices. Seven years later, when President Barack Obama increased tariffs on tires imported from China, the initiative was credited with saving about 1,200 jobs in the US tire manufacturing industry, but came at a $1.1 billion cost to Americans in the form of higher prices, the Peterson Institute for International Economics found. The 2018 tariffs imposed by Trump did not result in an immediate boost to manufacturing employment but instead led to a net loss of jobs and rising prices for consumers due to higher input costs and retaliatory tariffs, Federal Reserve economists noted in a 2019 paper. Costs to consumers Tariffs typically make more political sense than economic sense, Sweet noted. \u201cMost economists view tariffs as a bad idea because they prevent a country from reaping the benefits of specialization, disrupt the movement of goods and services, and lead to a misallocation of resources,\u201d Sweet wrote. \u201cConsumers and producers often pay higher prices when tariffs are implemented.\u201d That\u2019s because tariffs tax imports when they come ashore, adding costs for US distributors, retailers and, ultimately, consumers. The US International Trade Commission said in a\u00a02023 study\u00a0that US importers \u201cbore nearly the full cost\u201d of the Trump tariffs. Worse, some businesses appeared to take advantage of the trade war by bumping up prices even higher. Goldman Sachs found that tariffs allowed US producers and non-Chinese exporters to the US market to \u201copportunistically raise their prices as well.\u201d The New York Fed found that the 2018 tariffs cost US households $419 per year because of higher tax burdens and market efficiency losses. Researchers estimated that would double as the tariffs went into effect in 2019. As more time has passed, the positive economic effects have become even less clear cut. The net economic effect of the import tariffs, retaliatory tariffs and agricultural subsidies \u201cwas at best a wash, and it may have been mildly negative,\u201d to US jobs and businesses, economists wrote in a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper published in January 2024. The trade war did appear to have political benefits in strengthening support for the Republican party in the US heartland and communities most affected by the tariffs, researchers noted in the NBER working paper. \u201cResidents of tariff-protected locations became less likely to identify as Democrats and more likely to vote for President Trump,\u201d they wrote. \u201cVoters thus appear to have responded favorably to the extension of tariff protections to local industries despite their economic cost.\u201d The flow of imports The Covid-19 pandemic\u2019s discombobulating effects on supply chains distort the full picture of how the 2018-2019 tariffs affected US manufacturing and trade. US importers had started to substitute away from Chinese goods, but once the pandemic struck and US consumer demand increased, domestic inventory levels drew down quickly and China imports ramped back up, Wells Fargo economists wrote in an April note. However, by the end of 2023, imports from China were down 3% relative to 2019 while there was a 50% growth in imports from South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam, Nicole Cervi, an economist at Wells Fargo, told CNN in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely some data to suggest that we\u2019ve seen stronger imports from countries outside of China, and some of it may be that Chinese businesses are perhaps relocating some of their operations to these other countries that are not being affected by the Section 301 tariffs,\u201d Cervi said. Recent ocean and air freight data gives further rise to suspicions that China may be trying to circumvent US tariffs via Mexico, said Peter Sand, chief analyst with Xeneta, an ocean and air freight analytics and logistics company. Container shipping imports from China to Mexico rocketed higher by 60% in January and 34% for the first quarter, Xeneta data shows. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot,\u201d Sand told CNN in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s staggering.\u201d What was once an immature trade lane is now one of the busiest in the world, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that imports to this extent are not only for domestic purposes in Mexico,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/economy/inflation-new-china-tariffs-biden-example/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_business_faa-short-on-air-traffic-controllers", "text": "Despite a surge in hiring last year, air traffic control stations nationwide are still about 3,000 controllers short, according to new Federal Aviation Administration numbers. The numbers, first reported by CNN,\u00a0show the challenge of filling the gap that led to flight delays and concerns that fatigue contributed to a series of near collisions on runways last year. The shortage is a concern of airlines, controllers, and watchdogs like the inspector general who last summer concluded the agency \u201cmade limited efforts to ensure adequate controller staffing at critical air traffic control facilities.\u201d The FAA has about 11,500 controllers who are either fully certified or have reached the stage in training where they can work independently, known as Certified Professional Controller In Training. The staffing plans developed by the FAA and the union representing air traffic controllers calls for more than 14,600 controllers to fully staff towers and centers. The numbers are for the fiscal year, which was through the end of September. Employees in the developmental stage or at the FAA\u2019s training academy are not included in either count. Last year, the FAA hired 1,512 new controller candidates \u2014 just above its goal of 1,500, the numbers indicate. The FAA told CNN it \u201chas taken several actions\u201d to address the shortage and improve safety. But at the same time, its air traffic control organization lost more than 1,300 employees, including controllers who retired or candidates who dropped out of training. About 400 failed out of the FAA\u2019s academy (which averages a pass rate of between 60% and 70%) and another 109 who were further along in the training pipeline also dropped out. The numbers suggest this hiring round netted about 160 workers, which was more successful than the previous hiring cycle. The union president representing air traffic controllers said that after accounting for departures, the agency netted an increase of only six new controllers that year. The FAA is aiming to hire 1,800 controllers in the current year, which ends in September. Airlines for America, the trade group representing major passenger carriers, said the system \u201cof hiring and training is fundamentally broken if it takes this long to hire and train controllers.\u201d \u201cWe are particularly concerned as our carriers have been working diligently to meet record summer travel in the coming weeks, and carriers have had to cut back their schedules in congested areas to accommodate the ATC shortage at the expense of travelers who are seeing fewer flight options in those markets,\u201d the group said in a statement to CNN. The major aviation policy bill that passed the Senate and is awaiting a House vote requires the agency to maximize hiring for the next several years. It also instructs the FAA to install additional simulators at air traffic control sites to speed up training progress. The current understaffing means controllers at many facilities are regularly working overtime to cover gaps. Administrator Mike Whitaker just last month ordered the agency to increase minimum rest standards, up to as little as 10 hours off between shifts.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/business/faa-short-on-air-traffic-controllers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

And now the ride-or-die diamond-handed GameStop crowd is trying to get the band back together. See here: On Monday, after three years out of silence, one of the orchestrators of the 2021 GameStop surge roared back into the spotlight with a wordless meme on X that his followers interpreted as a rally cry for the stock he put on the map. The account is linked to Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty, aka DeepF\u2014ingValue. From that single, cryptic post depicting a man sitting in an office chair \u2014 a meme that suggests\u00a0\u201cwhen things get serious\u201d \u2014 GameStop (GME) shares soared more than 100% before being halted for volatility. The stock ended Monday up more than 70%, rising $13 to $30.45 a share. On Tuesday, the meme-ing continued, as GameStop rose another 70%. AMC, another meme investor favorite, rose 85%. Tupperware surged 35% and BlackBerry \u2014 yes, you can still trade BlackBerry \u2014 was up 13%. Beyond Meat, a former Wall Street darling that\u2019s been struggling with waning demand for its plant-based burgers, was up 27%. \u201cNo fundamental investors are involved in this,\u201d Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told me. \u201cThe fundamentals didn\u2019t make sense at $9 a share, they don\u2019t make sense at $30 a share. But for those who\u2019ve been awaiting the next signal, it arrived.\u201d Why now While we don\u2019t know why Gill, who didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment, chose to emerge from the shadows this week, it\u2019s clear the timing was ripe for another surge. Another meme stock, Trump Media and Technology Group, the Donald Trump-owned media company that controls Truth Social, brought back memories of the 2021 GameStop bonanza. Then, a team of amateurs on Reddit collectively stuck it to the man by squeezing traders who had short interest (bets that the stock would fall) on GameStop, AMC (AMC), Bed Bath & Beyond and others. With Trump Media, Trump supporters and other speculative traders pumped up the stock not for its (extraordinarily lousy) fundamentals, but more as a vote of support for the former president\u2019s campaign and even a barometer of his winning chances. The stock, which has surged nearly 200% this year, has been extremely volatile, rising and falling rapidly depending on the whims of the day. Back in 2021, the meme stock emerged for the first time out of a collision of macro forces: An unprecedented mix of pandemic-era cheap money, boredom, social media, and the widespread adoption of free trading apps to dabble in equity markets. We\u2019re not quite as exuberant today as we were then, but we\u2019re still within spitting distance of all-time highs on major stock indices, Sosnick notes. In some ways, the arrival in the spring of Donald Trump\u2019s media company reawakened the meme stock monster. \u201cIf I were Roaring Kitty in the crowd, seeing what happened to DJT,\u201d Sosnick says, \u201cit may have made a lot of them think, \u2018Oh wait, maybe we can get the band back together.\u201d The water is warm, and day traders may be spoiling for a fight, especially if they\u2019re among the legion who caught the 2021 wave too late. Michael Pachter, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, told me that the difference between the 2021 craze and now is that the David of the story no longer has a Goliath like Melvin Capital, Gabe Plotkin\u2019s hedge fund, which ran itself into the ground shorting GameStop. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the people who are short the stock are as adamant\u201d as Plotkin, who \u201chad more conviction than money,\u201d according to Pachter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/business/meme-stocks-gamestop-trump-media-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

New data released Tuesday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed that as household debt balances grew during the first quarter, delinquencies also marched higher. Notably, the percentage of credit card balances in serious delinquency (90 days or more late) climbed to its highest level since 2012. \u201cIn the first quarter of 2024, credit card and auto loan transition rates into serious delinquency continued to rise across all age groups,\u201d Joelle Scally, regional economic principal within the Household and Public Policy Research Division at the New York Fed, said in a statement. \u201cAn increasing number of borrowers missed credit card payments, revealing worsening financial distress among some households.\u201d Aggregate delinquency rates increased during the first quarter to 3.2% of outstanding debt in some stage of delinquency, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2020, according to the New York Fed\u2019s latest Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit. The transitions into delinquency \u2014 especially serious delinquency \u2014 increased across all debt types, according to the report. Delinquencies fell to historic lows during the pandemic as consumers spent less during the health and safety lockdowns and were able to build up savings and pay off debt with those funds and economic stimulus payments. However, as supply chain and spending imbalances fueled domestic and global inflation \u2014 and subsequently a rise of interest rates \u2014 delinquencies have moved higher in recent years. While the delinquency transition rates remain below what was seen during the Great Recession, they\u2019re running higher than what was seen pre-pandemic. Because of that, New York Fed researchers said they\u2019re keeping a close watch on what this means for the well-being of Americans\u2019 household finances and the overall economy. Overall household debt grew by 1.1% during the first quarter to $17.69 trillion, according to data that is not adjusted for inflation. The quarterly increase was driven largely by mortgage balances. Credit card balances dipped (as they typically do post-holidays) by $14 billion to $1.12 trillion. However, when adjusting for inflation, balances have yet to surpass the levels seen in 2008. Higher balances can be attributed to population growth, an increase in\u00a0online spending,\u00a0the surging cost of new and used cars, as well as\u00a0economy-powering consumer\u00a0activity.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/economy/household-debt-credit-q1-delinquencies/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

The announcement of Sutskever\u2019s departure comes one day after OpenAI unveiled its latest artificial intelligence model, GPT-4o, in a presentation that impressed onlookers with its capabilities. Sutskever\u2019s role at OpenAI will be filled by Jakub Pachocki, previously the company\u2019s director of research, according to the company. Sutskever made headlines nearly six months ago when he voted to remove Altman as chief executive and chairman of the board. CNN contributor Kara Swisher previously reported that the decision to fire Altman was driven by Sutskever\u2019s concerns that Altman had pushed AI technology \u201ctoo far, too fast.\u201d Days after Altman\u2019s ouster, Sutskever had a change of heart: He signed an employee letter calling for the entire board to resign and for Altman to return. Altman did not stay on the outs for too long. Five days after his firing, Altman returned to the company as CEO, and Sutskever issued a public apology for his role in the corporate drama. \u201cI deeply regret my participation in the board\u2019s actions,\u201d Sutskever wrote on X in November. \u201cI never intended to harm OpenAI. I love everything we\u2019ve built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company.\u201d In the months since, OpenAI has continued to push advancements of its flagship product, ChatGPT. Its latest model, announced Monday, will be available to unpaid customers and can effectively turn ChatGPT into a digital personal assistant that can engage in real-time spoken conversations. Sutskever played a defining role in OpenAI\u2019s rise to power in the AI scene. In 2019, Altman, Sutskever and Greg Brockman\u00a0jointly formed\u00a0OpenAI LP, a for-profit entity within the larger nonprofit company\u2019s structure. A few years later, the company earned a valuation of $90 billion. In a statement, Altman said the news of Sutskever\u2019s departure was \u201cvery sad.\u201d \u201cI am forever grateful for what he did here and committed to finishing the mission we started together,\u201d Altman said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/tech/openai-chief-scientist-ilya-sutskever-departs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_business_housing-market-good-time-to-buy", "text": "Americans remain historically gloomy about the state of the housing market. Just 21% say it\u2019s a good time to buy a house, according to a Gallup survey released Thursday. That is tied with last year for the worst reading in Gallup history. An overwhelming majority of Americans \u2014 76% \u2014 say it\u2019s a bad time to buy a house. That\u2019s just below the record of 78% set a year ago. The findings reflect lingering frustration with the affordability crisis in housing. Young Americans seeking to buy a home have been confronted by a toxic one-two punch of record-high home prices and painful mortgage rates. \u201cAmericans remain highly pessimistic about the market for homebuyers,\u201d Jeffrey Jones, Gallup Senior Editor, wrote in the report. The survey is yet another economic indicator that should trouble White House officials as they struggle to win over Americans upset with the high cost of living. For context, in April 2019, the final reading before Covid-19, 61% of Americans polled by Gallup said it was a good time to buy a house. The record high was set in April 2003 at 81% as the housing boom was kicking into high gear. Mortgage rates top 7% Americans started to sour on the housing market as mortgage rates spiked and home prices surged after Covid. The percentage of Americans who said it was a bad time to buy a house climbed from just 36% in April 2019 to 69% by April 2022. After years of dirt-cheap borrowing costs, mortgage rates have climbed sharply in recent years due to the Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive efforts to get inflation under control. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage edged down slightly on Thursday to 7.09% from 7.22% the week prior. This followed five straight weeks of increases. Current rates are twice as high as the rate in February 2020 just before Covid. The spike in mortgage rates has made it increasingly unaffordable for prospective homebuyers. For instance, monthly mortgage payments on a $500,000 home after putting 20% down are about $900 higher today under current rates than they would have been under the 3.5% rates of early 2020. Over the lifetime of a 30-year loan, that amounts to $331,200 in additional interest costs. \u201cEven at the high mortgage rates of today, many properties on the affordable price tier are drawing multiple offers \u2014 which automatically means only one winner and many who lost out on bids,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. Mortgage rates should dip when the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates. However, stubborn inflation has delayed expectations on Wall Street for when the Fed will be able to cut rates. One of the causes of worse-than-expected inflation readings? High housing costs. \u201cOnce mortgage rates retreat and as more supply appears on the market, as I anticipate later this year, more buyers will get into the market independently of what their sentiments are today,\u201d Yun said. Record home prices The affordability headaches are compounded by the fact that home prices are up, too, amid a shortage of housing. The median existing-home sales price increased 5% year-over-year in March to $393,500 \u2014 the highest price ever for the month of March, according to NAR. Home prices increased across the country, led by a 10% jump in the Northeast to $434,600. Americans don\u2019t think these home price gains are nearly done. According to the new Gallup survey, 68% of US adults expect home prices in their local area to increase in the coming year. That\u2019s up from 56% a year ago. The only higher readings in Gallup history were 71% in 2021 and 70%, matched in 2005 and 2022. Of course, higher home prices cut both ways. For those who already own a home, the jump in real estate values has added to their net worth. It helps explain why Americans\u2019 inflation-adjusted median net worth increased by 37% between 2019 and 2022. Homeowners can also tap that housing wealth as a source of cash, borrowing against the value of their home to pay bills, fund college tuition or renovate their home. Yet many young Americans dreaming of owning their own home remain on the outside looking in. And the continued increase in prices will only push that dream further out of reach.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/business/housing-market-good-time-to-buy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_business_who-is-melinda-french-gates-philanthropist", "text": "On Monday, Melinda French Gates announced her resignation from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, officially ending one of the world\u2019s leading philanthropic partnerships. If you ask Warren Buffett, the foundation is losing its smarter half. In a 2008 Fortune profile, the Berkshire Hathaway CEO said French Gates helped focus the foundation\u2019s mission. \u201cHe\u2019s smart as hell, obviously,\u201d Buffett said of Microsoft cofounder and former CEO Bill Gates. \u201cBut in terms of seeing the whole picture, she\u2019s smarter,\u201d referring to French Gates. French Gates\u2019 departure marks the end of an era for the 24-year-old foundation, which she cofounded with her ex-husband, Bill Gates \u201cThis is not a decision I came to lightly,\u201d French Gates said in a statement on social media, announcing that her last day of work would be June 7. Since its founding in 2000, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has grown into one of the world\u2019s largest private charitable organizations, paying out a total of $77.6 billion in grants through the end of 2023. In her departure announcement, French Gates said she plans to continue her philanthropic work independently, focusing on issues affecting women and girls in the United States and around the world. Here\u2019s how she became one of the world\u2019s preeminent philanthropists. From early Microsoft hire to billionaire donor French Gates started her career at Microsoft, where she was hired after graduating from Duke University, according to a 2008 profile in Fortune Magazine. She began her philanthropic life in 1997, one year after she left her job at Microsoft, cofounding the Gates Library Foundation with her then-husband, Bill Gates. The foundation\u2019s mission was to help US public libraries offer free internet access, according to the Bill and Melinda Gates\u2019 Foundation\u2019s website. That foundation was a precursor to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which officially launched in 2000 with a focus on global health, science and education. The foundation has launched funds to fight diseases such as AIDS, polio and malaria, fight malnutrition and help women gain access to contraceptives, according to the foundation\u2019s website. \u201cWe literally go down the chart of the greatest inequities and give where we can effect the greatest change,\u201d French Gates said of the foundation\u2019s strategy in Fortune. After a few years in operation, the foundation got an early boost from Buffett, who pledged a lifetime gift of more than $30 billion dollars to the foundation. Outside of the foundation, French Gates made a significant impact on the world of philanthropy by helping to create The Giving Pledge in 2010. According to The Giving Pledge\u2019s website, the pledge, which has more than 240 signatories, is a promise among the world\u2019s richest people to dedicate a majority of their wealth to charitable causes during their lifetimes or in their wills. In addition to French Gates, Gates and Buffett, The Giving Pledge counts billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and MacKenzie Scott as signatories. \u201cI recognize the absurdity of so much wealth being concentrated in the hands of one person, and I believe the only responsible thing to do with a fortune this size is give it away\u2014 as thoughtfully and impactfully as possible,\u201d French Gates wrote in her pledge letter. French Gates has a net worth of $13.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, while Bill Gates\u2019 net worth is $153 billion. But as part of their agreement when French Gates departed, she will receive an additional $12.5 billion to give away. Breaking out on her own Over the past decade, French Gates has increasingly added a new focus to her charitable work: gender equality. She created her own organization, Pivotal Ventures, in 2015. Pivotal is an investment company that \u201cexpands opportunity and accelerates equality in the United States through high-impact investments, partnerships and advocacy,\u201d according to its website. One of Pivotal\u2019s earliest grantees was Rutgers\u2019 Center for American Women in Politics, which conducts scholarly research about women\u2019s political participation in the US. French Gates\u2019 departure from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has been hinted at since the couple announced their divorce in May 2021. She will not continue her work that she was performing at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the organization said Monday. So French Gates hinted at a new path foward. \u201cI\u2019ll be sharing more about what that will look like in the near future,\u201d French Gates said in her departure announcement.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/business/who-is-melinda-french-gates-philanthropist/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_business_india-election-economic-boom-winners-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "As Indians head to the polls in a massive ongoing nationwide election, much attention has focused on the country\u2019s explosive growth under Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s leadership. During his past decade in office, India\u2019s fast-growing economy has become the world\u2019s fifth largest as the country woos foreign investors and embarks on a massive infrastructure transformation, spending billions on new highways, ports, airports and railways. While not everyone has benefited and income inequality has deepened \u2014 millions still live in sprawling slums and youth unemployment has soared \u2014 Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are widely expected to win another five-year term and push forward that economic expansion. That\u2019s partly because many in the world\u2019s most populous country, especially among the younger generation, share a common belief: India is on the rise. More than 40% of India\u2019s 1.4 billion people is under 25: a massive, tech-savvy and mostly English-speaking labor force, with their eyes set on the future. Like millions of migrants from across the country, many of them are drawn to the country\u2019s financial capital Mumbai, full of aspiration and ambition. And it\u2019s stories like these that inspire them. The tech developer As a kid, Javed Khatri loved going to the train station. Not to catch a ride or watch the endless flow of people \u2013 but to stand near the ticket booth and glimpse the mainframe computers behind the counter. Growing up poor in the slums of Mumbai, he\u2019d never used a smartphone or computer. The screens and machines at the train station fascinated Khatri, the son of a carpenter and a housewife. \u201cIn the region where I used to stay, one of the best things that one could think of was just to complete 10th grade, and then work at a call center or sell vegetables or work at a garage or do some kind of odd jobs,\u201d says Khatri, now 30. \u201cThat was our topmost ambition.\u201d But he was lucky, he says. Unlike many children in the slums, his parents encouraged him to focus on education rather than start working young to help support the family. He completed 10th grade \u2013 the first person in four generations of his family to do so \u2013 then studied computer science at an engineering college. But it was a shock to the system. On his first day, the class was given tasks that Khatri\u2019s more privileged peers sailed through easily. Meanwhile, he was trying to figure out how to use a mouse and type on a keyboard. \u201cThat\u2019s where people started mocking me, they started making fun of me,\u201d he tells CNN from the high-rise building where he now works. \u201cI considered quitting engineering at one point in time because it was becoming unbearable.\u201d He sank into a six-month depression \u2014 but it was also a transformative period. He threw himself into learning everything he could. Online, he befriended people from around the world on forums, and took entrepreneurship courses. He was so fixated he often only slept four or five hours a night. \u201cThat was the hunger to learn back then,\u201d he says. \u201cI got introduced to a whole new world altogether.\u201d He started building apps and small businesses with his classmates, who began seeking out his company after noticing his improved skills. After graduating, he decided to start a mobile app developer with two co-founders and only 20,000 rupees (about $240) to his name. He was under pressure, with his parents and two younger siblings depending on his success. But his company forged ahead, and after several years he sold it for $2 million. He is now building a new online platform to connect tech firms with engineers, and says his success has changed the trajectory of his family. He moved them all out of the slum, and he supports his parents\u2019 early retirement. Both his siblings went to college and pursued their own careers. None of this would have been possible a generation ago, he says. \u201cOver the last 10 years, people have got access to the right kind of information with the help of the internet,\u201d he says. Now, the government is encouraging more startups, with growing awareness around entrepreneurship thanks to business reality shows like \u201cShark Tank,\u201d and its Indian spin-off. Among India\u2019s large cohort of young people, \u201cmore and more people are opting for entrepreneurship and creating more opportunities for the world and the country itself,\u201d he says. \u201cThis itself is a big sign that the next decade belongs to India.\u201d The influencer When the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020, college student Apoorva Mukhija moved back home with her parents \u2014 and hated it immediately. In their small township, \u201ceverybody knew everybody, everybody talked about each other,\u201d she says. Without good friends nearby, she turned to Instagram and started posting comedy videos. \u201cContent was my only escape, it kept me sane,\u201d she says. \u201cI was genuinely really desperate to talk to somebody, and so the camera was my friend.\u201d It felt like a natural step; Mukhija had always been the class clown, she says. But with much of the world confined to their homes, there was an unprecedented demand for online entertainment \u2013 and creators like her. She kept posting videos as she finished her computer science degree, on topics ranging from boredom in class to being reprimanded by parents, gaining hundreds of thousands of followers. But she hadn\u2019t planned to be a content creator, so after graduation she took a job with a tech firm in Bangalore, the southern city known as \u201cIndia\u2019s Silicon Valley.\u201d \u201cThen one day I just woke up, realized \u2026 (my job) just didn\u2019t pay as well as content did, and I hated living in that city,\u201d Mukhija, 22, tells CNN from a pastel-pink couch at her new apartment in Mumbai, which she says is her \u201cdream city.\u201d Her career has thrived, winning her recognition from local media and amassing 1.3 million Instagram followers, many of whom regularly stop her in the street for a selfie. The internet holds a wealth of opportunity for young Indians, Mukhija says. The country\u2019s influencer marketing industry is expected to be worth more than $281 million in 2024, and $405 million by 2026, according to an April report by consultancy EY India. Ubiquitous smartphones and social media are fueling this growth. There is expected to be 740 million active smartphone users in India by 2030, according to EY India. That\u2019s still less than half the population \u2013 underscoring the room for growth. And there\u2019s money to be made. Influencer marketing firm Kofluence estimated in a report this year that Indian influencers with more than 1 million Instagram followers can earn anywhere from 300,000 to 1,500,000 rupees (about $3,600 to $18,000) monthly depending on the size of their audience. That\u2019s a handsome sum in a country where the annual gross domestic product per capita is still around $2,400, according to the World Bank. This new, exciting space has opened doors for young creators like Mukhija, who just completed filming in her first acting role. Filmmakers are increasingly seeking out influencers to attract their fanbase, she says, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t go for auditions, auditions come to me.\u201d And, more significantly, she\u2019s been able to share her success with her parents, a civil servant and an English teacher. Though she\u2019d grown up with privileges like private school and domestic family holidays, it was thanks to her parents\u2019 sacrifices, she says. Her father had driven the same car for 16 years despite its frequent breakdowns, and they had never traveled outside India before. So in late 2022, she surprised her family with tickets to Dubai, their first international trip. The video, posted on Instagram, shows her younger brother gleefully jumping on the bed, and her mother wiping her eyes before pulling Mukhija into a hug. \u201cMy dad comes from nothing, he has built himself up,\u201d she tells CNN. \u201cSo it\u2019s just nice that they\u2019ve given me so much and maybe I can give a fraction of it back to them.\u201d She\u2019s dreaming bigger for herself, too. She has applied to MBA programs in London and California, which wouldn\u2019t have been possible without her content creation income. And with so many people across the country tuning in on their phones, that rise isn\u2019t slowing anytime soon. \u201cEverybody\u2019s a content creator today,\u201d Mukhija says. \u201cAnd with this much population, you ought to have an audience, no matter what kind of content you\u2019re making \u2026 In India, it\u2019s so easy to just find somebody to watch your content.\u201d The shoemaker Jameel Shah caught the Bollywood bug as a teenage runaway, fascinated by the sight of movie stars plastered on billboards in India\u2019s capital. \u201cI wanted to see them, and someone told me I would not find Bollywood stars in Delhi, but in Mumbai,\u201d he says. At age 13, Shah ran away from his village in Bihar, India\u2019s poorest state, where his father wasn\u2019t earning enough from farming to send the kids to school. Seeking work, he ran off to Delhi without telling anyone \u2014 but was soon on his way to Mumbai, the birthplace of Hindi cinema. But once in Mumbai, he was scammed out of his savings by a friend who disappeared after making false promises to introduce him to Bollywood stars. He followed the scammer to Bangalore before he ran out of money and became stranded. That proved to be a turning point. Shah started working as a security guard at a building that housed a dance studio, where he watched people whirl and stomp across the floor with wide-eyed intrigue \u2013 until the studio owner agreed to let him learn for free. Dancing with female partners was foreign and shocking. \u201cWhere I came from, one cannot be at such close proximity with women,\u201d says Shah, 40. \u201cThere was a shortage of men in the class, so I was given two women to dance with, which made me very happy.\u201d By the time he returned to Mumbai as an 18-year-old, his passion for dance had taken root and he continued learning for free under a Bollywood choreographer while working odd jobs. Every week, he would walk from his home in Dharavi, Asia\u2019s biggest slum, to dance classes in an affluent nearby district of tall office buildings, upscale hotels and foreign consulates. Seeing all this, \u201cI still wanted to do something better in life,\u201d Shah says. Finally, he saw his opportunity in the expensive imported dance shoes required for class. \u201cI wanted to make similar shoes that were printed with \u2018Made in India,\u2019\u201d Shah says. He took two samples back to the narrow alleys of Dharavi, a long-established hub for leather and textile manufacturers. With their expertise, and his own experience working in bag and wallet factories, Shah began experimenting. After four years of trial and error, Shah Shoes was born. The business grew, attracting stylists and choreographers who redistributed the shoes to dance studios. And they even made it onto the big screen. \u201cI have made shoes for a lot of Bollywood stars like Priyanka Chopra and Katrina Kaif. Many times I am not aware that these actors have used my shoes; it\u2019s only when I see them dancing (in movies) I realize that they were made by me because of their unique cut, design and style,\u201d Shah says. One career highlight was when a choreographer introduced him to Kylie Minogue. \u201cShe loved my shoes and bought eight pairs,\u201d he says, excitedly showing CNN a photo of himself with the Australian pop star. Some 17 years on, Shah Shoes has helped support his family back in Bihar, including six siblings. He\u2019s bought a house for his parents, and started an education center in his home village teaching literacy to those who can\u2019t afford school. \u201cI never imagined I would reach such an important stage in my life as my only obsession was to meet Bollywood stars. But today I make these wonderful shoes,\u201d he says. A key tool was the rise of social media, particularly Facebook, helping him find customers \u2013 which Shah credited to Prime Minister Modi\u2019s push for a \u201cdigital India.\u201d And, he added, \u201cmy business will just keep growing with the kind of economic growth we see in India.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/business/india-election-economic-boom-winners-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_business_fed-chair-powell-ppi-inflation", "text": "After another reading of hotter-than-expected inflation, you\u2019d think Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell might be getting a little worried that the battle will go on much longer than expected. But Powell, for the most part, isn\u2019t stressing ahead of Wednesday\u2019s crucial Consumer Price Index data set to be released in the morning. Tuesday\u2019s wholesale inflation data, which jumped to its highest rate in a year, certainly wasn\u2019t a source of comfort. And it comes after March\u2019s unexpected jump in consumer prices to 3.5% on an annual basis from 3.2% in February. The Producer Price Index, which measures the change in prices that manufacturers pay to suppliers, rose 0.5%, a much faster pace than March\u2019s 0.1% decline. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it hot, I would call it sort of mixed,\u201d Powell said Tuesday, referring to the new wholesale inflation data. But Powell acknowledged that the first quarter had been \u201cnotable for its lack of progress on inflation,\u201d he said at an event hosted by the Foreign Bankers\u2019 Association speaking alongside European Central Bank Governing Council member Klaas Knot. \u201cWe did not expect this to be a smooth road, but these were higher than I think anybody expected,\u201d Powell said. Still, he predicts monthly inflation readings will revert to lower levels seen last year, but noted that his confidence isn\u2019t as high as before the disappointing inflation readings so far this year. Most Fed officials share Powell\u2019s concerns that inflation could prove to be more persistent than anticipated, making it more challenging to achieve the central bank\u2019s 2% target. He\u2019s far from conceding that, though given some employers are still having difficulty filling open positions, which he believes is contributing to inflation by putting upward pressure on wages, he said. But some officials recently have expressed fears that inflation could ramp up even higher, potentially to levels that would merit raising interest rates. \u201cI remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a future meeting, should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed,\u201d Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said earlier this month. Another troubling sign for US central bankers is consumers\u2019 belief that inflation will move higher in the year ahead, according to two surveys Fed officials monitor closely. Since inflation expectations can effectively control the pace of price hikes, businesses take those expectations into account when pricing goods and services. That can lead to higher prices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/business/fed-chair-powell-ppi-inflation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_business_immigration-trump-inflation-jobs", "text": "If voters return former President Donald Trump to the White House, he\u2019s promised to launch an unprecedented crackdown on immigration and even conduct mass deportations. Trump recently told Time that he would aim to deport 15 million to 20 million people, perhaps by using the National Guard. Some economists worry that Trump\u2019s proposed immigration crackdown \u2014 if it survived legal challenges \u2014 would backfire on the US economy by worsening worker shortages, reigniting inflation and forcing the Federal Reserve to keep borrowing costs high for even longer. \u201cIf he follows through in deporting a significant amount of immigrants, that\u2019s going to be very difficult for businesses,\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s, told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s going to cause them to raise wages and prices.\u201d Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, said the problem is that the supply of native-born workers simply cannot meet demand. \u201cWe need to import workers,\u201d Brusuelas said. \u201cIf either party oversteps in reducing the flow of workers, it\u2019s likely we would face a serious shortage of workers and a renewed bout of inflation. You would drive the unemployment rate down to 3% and wages would pop. You\u2019d get classic inflation.\u201d And that would have serious implications for the Fed, which has already warned that interest rates will need to stay high for longer than anticipated to fight stubborn inflation. \u201cIn that case, higher for longer has a much different meaning,\u201d said Brusuelas. In a statement to CNN, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt argued, without evidence, that President Joe Biden \u201callowed\u201d undocumented immigrants to \u201cinvade our border\u201d and that if he\u2019s reelected they will be allowed to stay. \u201cMedicare, Social Security, the healthcare system, public safety and American democracy itself will buckle and collapse,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cWhen President\u00a0Trump\u00a0is back in the White House, he will deport the millions of illegal immigrants Joe Biden let in and reimplement his America First, pro-growth, pro-job agenda to uplift all Americans.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s a rip-off\u2019 Inflation remains a major concern for Americans. Even though consumer prices are no longer skyrocketing, the cumulative impact of three years of high inflation is painful. Americans are paying much more for housing, food and car insurance than they were before Covid-19. Frustrations with the high cost of living helped drive down consumer sentiment to a six-month low, the University of Michigan survey of consumers found on Friday. \u201cMost Americans view high inflation and high prices as unfair. It\u2019s a rip-off. How is it possible I\u2019m paying more for something \u2013 a lot more for something \u2013 today than three years ago?\u201d said Zandi. Anger over inflation could help return Trump to the White House. And yet, ironically, economists warn that his immigration plan \u2013 and his vow to impose massive tariffs on China and other nations \u2013 could worsen that same inflation problem. \u201cMy sense is President Trump\u2019s policies are inflationary,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cIt\u2019s higher tariffs, it\u2019s more deportations. \u2026 I think these things are going to lead to higher prices for American consumers.\u201d Some businesses continue to face a shortage of workers. Although the number of job openings has tumbled in recent months, it remains well above pre-pandemic levels, according to the Labor Department. Migrant crisis Of course, it\u2019s hard to know whether Trump would carry through on his immigration proposals. After all, he promised mass deportations in 2016, too. And Trump\u2019s immigration plans would surely face serious legal challenges. But immigration remains a major concern for voters in the 2024 election and Trump has made it a centerpiece of his campaign. The spike in immigration over the last several years has caused a severe strain on resources in some cities and states as officials scramble to house, educate and feed asylum seekers. And the flow of migrants, along with a series of high-profile criminal cases involving migrants, have contributed to concerns about crime \u2014 though criminologists are skeptical about the connection. Even the Biden administration has tried to take a tougher position on immigration. Last week, US officials proposed a rule that would let immigration authorities rapidly reject migrants who are ineligible for asylum. A positive supply shock Yet economists say the immigration spike has also played a major role in one of the big positive surprises of the past few years: America\u2019s ability to defy recession forecasts. To the shock of many forecasters, the post-Covid labor market has not run out of workers. Jobs growth continues at a pace few thought possible. And the unemployment rate has stayed under 4% for 27 months in a row, matching the record streak from 1967 to 1970. Economists say the recent spike in immigration helped make these surprises possible, by preventing the jobs market from totally overheating and the Fed from overdoing rate hikes. \u201cIt helped to ease the very tight labor market, bring in some of those wage pressures and reduce inflation,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cIt also allowed the economy to grow more quickly.\u201d Prior to Covid-19, population and labor force projections from the federal government suggested the US economy would only be able to sustainably add (without worsening inflation) between 60,000 and 140,000 jobs per month and then between 60,000 and 100,000 per month by 2024, according to research from The Hamilton Project. In reality, the US economy added an average of 255,000 jobs per month in 2023 \u2014 two to four times the pace considered sustainable, research notes. \u201cJust in the last year, a big part of the story of the labor market coming back into better balance is immigration returning to levels that were more typical of the pre-pandemic era,\u201d Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in February. Net immigration of 2.3 million in 2023 The Hamilton Project paper estimates sustainable employment growth will be between 160,000 and 200,000 per month in 2024 \u2014 about double what would have been possible before the immigration surge. Without that influx of workers, the US economy could have faced a different fate. \u201cThe Fed would have likely overdone it with rates and tipped the economy into recession,\u201d said Brusuelas, the RSM economist. Immigration collapsed when the Covid-19 pandemic began in early 2020, contributing to the historic shortage of workers that drove up wages. But then immigration rebounded massively in 2022 and 2023, in part because of a surge of migrants. US authorities had more than 2.5 million encounters with migrants crossing the US-Mexico border last year alone, according to Homeland Security estimates. In 2023, the United States experienced net immigration of about 3.3 million, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That well exceeds the average of just 900,000 that was typical between 2010 and 2019. The immigration spike has been so significant that the CBO estimates the United States is on track to have 1.7 million more people in its pool of workers this year compared with what was expected last year. Goldman Sachs economists estimate that the immigration surge eased wage growth by 0.3 percentage points at the national level and by at least twice as much in the low-paying leisure and hospitality sector. Although the \u201ctextbook answer\u201d is that immigration should not matter much for wages and inflation, Goldman Sachs economists recently told clients: \u201cWe think this time was a bit different.\u201d \u201cThe main reasons are that the immigration turnaround was very large and that it occurred at a time when the labor market was historically overheated,\u201d Goldman Sachs economists wrote. What happens next Looking ahead, Goldman Sachs said \u201cmoderate fluctuations\u201d in immigration will probably have \u201clittle impact\u201d on wage growth and inflation. The exception, the bank said, would be in the event of \u201cdramatic policy changes.\u201d Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project and senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, told CNN she is \u201cconfident\u201d an immigration crackdown like the one Trump proposes would have \u201cnegative\u201d effects on the economy. However, Edelberg is less concerned about the inflationary impact and more worried about a crash in demand \u2014 especially in communities that have experienced a large influx of immigrants. She noted that some businesses have enjoyed a sharp increase in demand in recent years in large part because of immigrants. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thing that could spark a recession,\u201d Edelberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to suggest this would be a cataclysmic recession, but this would be a very abrupt reduction in aggregate demand. Generally, that\u2019s not the kind of thing that our economy likes.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/business/immigration-trump-inflation-jobs/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_media_planet-fitness-membership-inflation", "text": "The Planet Fitness $10-a-month membership plan is a powerful marketing tool and a central part of its strategy. But the largest gym chain in the United States is hiking that monthly fee for the first time in more than two decades. Planet Fitness will raise the price of its \u201cclassic\u201d membership from $10 a month to $15 for new members beginning in the summer. The \u201cclassic\u201d membership gives people access to one location. (Planet Fitness\u2019 $25 monthly \u201cBlack Card\u201d membership offers more location access and perks. Planet Fitness is not hiking this fee, although executives said they may begin testing higher prices for the plan.) Planet Fitness executives did not specify why the chain is raising the basic plan by 50% for the first time since 1998, but the move comes as higher interest rates and construction costs have slowed down new gym openings. Planet Fitness has no-frills gyms, with a basic selection of machines, no steam rooms or towels in the locker room to hold down costs. Higher costs threaten its business model \u2014 known in the fitness industry as high volume, low price, or \u201cHVLP\u201d \u2014 more so than luxury gyms. Businesses around the country have raised prices since the pandemic began in 2020, but Planet Fitness\u2019 $10 fee was one of the few things that had not changed because it was synonymous with the brand. \u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018get you off the couch\u2019 price,\u201d Planet Fitness\u2019 former CEO told CNN in 2022. Planet Fitness has long used the $10 basic membership to recruit people who are interested in exercising but have never joined a gym before, are intimidated by fitness fanatics at other gyms or can\u2019t afford pricier clubs. (A gym membership in the United States typically costs around $50 a month, and boutique gyms and high-intensity classes run double and triple that.) Planet Fitness blared out the $10 gym plan, which includes annual fees and free training, in commercials. The company has sponsored the New Year\u2019s Eve celebration in Times Square for years to get people thinking about signing up for memberships as their resolution. Forty percent of new Planet Fitness members have never belonged to a gym prior to signing up, according to the company. The $10 price was right in the sweet spot: cheap enough to draw people to Planet Fitness who want to get in shape and, equally as important, not so expensive that they will cancel if they don\u2019t go often, say analysts. Planet Fitness then tries to upsell these members by pushing them to its Black Card membership. The higher-priced monthly plan offers access to all of Planet Fitness\u2019 gyms and perks like water massage beds, massage chairs and tanning equipment, and Black Card members can also bring a visitor. On a conference call Thursday, one analyst, Sharon Zackfia from William Blair, said, \u201cit does seem like an odd time to take a 50% price increase on the classic card,\u201d given that consumers have been strained by inflation and are searching for deals. But Planet Fitness executives said consumers have grown accustomed to price hikes and the move will not hurt business. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in every industry people move in price,\u201d Planet Fitness interim CEO Craig Benson said. \u201cSo, it is not going to come as a shock to anybody that we are moving a price that\u2019s been in effect for a long, long time.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/media/planet-fitness-membership-inflation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "business"}}
