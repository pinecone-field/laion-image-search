Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing. Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive. Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year. The stock is one of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that have powered the lion\u2019s share of the market\u2019s returns this year, boosted by Wall Street\u2019s bet that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in tech.

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_investing_india-elections-stock-market-hnk-intl", "text": "Indian stocks plunged Tuesday as vote counting in the country\u2019s election suggested Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s dream of a landslide victory is at risk, raising doubts about his ability to push through more aggressive economic reforms. India\u2019s benchmark Sensex index, which tracks 30 large companies, and the broader Nifty 50 index each closed down by nearly 6%. The worst daily drop for Indian stocks since 2020 came just 24 hours after both indexes\u00a0hit record highs as weekend exit polls prompted experts to predict a resounding victory for Modi. The world\u2019s biggest election concluded on Saturday. The 73-year-old ran on his\u00a0economic record\u00a0over the past 10 years, a period of robust growth for India. His Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was aiming to win a 400-seat\u00a0supermajority\u00a0in the 543-seat lower house of parliament, but preliminary results show the opposition Congress party is performing\u00a0better than some analysts expected. A party or a coalition needs 272 seats to form a government. In India\u2019s last election in 2019, the BJP won 303 seats. If the final results confirm that Modi has underperformed in the polls, key economic reforms may be put on the back burner. \u201cThe (early) election results are showing a less than halfway mark (272 seats) for the current BJP government, pointing towards a coalition government,\u201d said Yashovardhan Khemka, Senior Manager, Research & Analytics at Mumbai-based asset management firm Abans Holdings. \u201cThis will lead to dependence on allies in making key policy decision\u2026 which will lead to policy paralysis and uncertainty in the government\u2019s functioning,\u201d he added. India is the world\u2019s fastest growing major economy and is comfortably placed to expand at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years, but analysts say it needs to achieve growth of\u00a08% or more\u00a0if it wants to become an economic superpower. Sustained expansion would push India higher up the ranks of the world\u2019s biggest economies, with some observers forecasting the country to become number three behind only the United States and China by 2027. The country\u2019s stock markets have performed well during Modi\u2019s tenure. Earlier this year, the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) overtook both the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Exchange to become the world\u2019s sixth largest bourse, data from the World Federation of Exchanges showed. But investors have complained about the high price of Indian stocks and some analysts believe a correction could be healthy for markets. According to Manish Jain, head of institutional business at Mirae Asset Capital Markets, if \u201cvaluations get more reasonable from here on,\u201d it would attract more investments to the world\u2019s fastest growing major economy, as \u201cIndia is a long term structural growth story.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/investing/india-elections-stock-market-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}

When Detroit became the largest municipality to go bankrupt in 2013, it had fallen hard from its glory days of the early to mid 20th century, when Henry Ford\u2019s arrival and creation of the first-ever moving assembly line vaulted the city into a manufacturing hub and the automotive capital of the world. Now, Michigan Central Station, the neighboring old Book Depository and Butler himself are all symbols of hope for Detroit\u2019s future and its ongoing economic resurgence. Last year, the rehabbed depository was opened to house a blossoming batch of mobility and energy startups, including one helmed by Butler, who started Energy Storage Safety Products International, which makes fire mitigation and prevention technologies for lithium ion batteries. Michigan Central Station will reopen on Thursday, following a six-year renovation and nearly $1 billion of investment from the Ford Motor Company and its founding family. The historic building\u2019s rebirth as a mixed-used property (with offices, a hotel and, eventually, restaurants and retail) anchoring an innovation-focused district will be celebrated with a blockbuster concert Thursday night. \u201cCorktown is a very vibrant neighborhood, it\u2019s the oldest neighborhood in Detroit, but there was 30 acres, including this incredible old train station that was literally sitting abandoned and looming over the city as a reminder of the rise and fall of Detroit,\u201d said Mary Culler, a longtime Ford executive and director of the Michigan Central Station innovation district. \u201cIt was a massive project and needed some incredible vision; but \u2026 when I think about what Ford has committed here, it really is incredible, because it is bringing back an asset to the city, along with the 30 acres around it, that is going to be incredibly vibrant,\u201d she added. \u2018You had to fix the place up\u2019 The renewed Michigan Central comes at a critical time in Detroit\u2019s economic recovery, which as been more than a decade in the making, said Kevin Johnson, president and chief executive officer at the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation. The city has come a long way since July 18, 2013, when Detroit was the largest municipality in US history to file for bankruptcy after years of declining revenue, population losses, rising crime, a national financial crisis, automaker struggles and political corruption. \u201cAny city worth its own salt has a vibrant downtown that pumps the blood into the neighborhoods that it needs in order for the revitalization in the neighborhoods to start taking place,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s been a theme in Detroit since 2013. Right when the bankruptcy happened, philanthropic, corporate, neighborhood groups, outside investors began to look at Detroit as a [growth] opportunity, versus an opportunity to close it out and close it down.\u201d And it started with the basics: repairing sidewalks, turning back on streetlights, revitalizing the riverfront, coordinating trash pickup, demolishing homes that were left abandoned, razing industrial facilities that had fallen into ruin. \u201cThe fundamentals of running a city was the core of what started this revitalization,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had to fix the place up.\u201d A resurgence within the automotive industry and Detroit\u2019s \u201cBig Three\u201d helped boost those efforts, Johnson said. \u201cThe automotive industry began to recreate itself into a new and powerful job creator for Detroit,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a demand from the Big Three that we want you as close to our production base as possible, and that gave rise to those suppliers taking some of those old abandoned facilities and regenerating them.\u201d The economic data speaks volumes of that long road back: The city is adding jobs, generating revenue and, for the first time in decades, adding population. As of April, Detroit\u2019s unemployment rate was 3.8%, a tick better than the US overall rate of 3.9%, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. \u201cI look at the unemployment rate to gauge the overall health of the labor market, which I think is an indicator of how the general economy is faring,\u201d said Charles Dougherty, senior economist at Wells Fargo. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty low, and has been low over the past few years.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to say that Detroit is fully on its way to a robust period of economic growth, but there are early indications that Detroit is at the beginning stages of mounting a comeback.\u201d Residents like Butler have had a front row seat to the resurgence. \u201cWhat you look for are cranes in the skylines, and now you see them everywhere, and it\u2019s a beautiful thing because it\u2019s something positive for the city.\u201d he said. \u201cBut, ostensibly, it took for [the bankruptcy] to happen in order to get the investments and get people coming in and seeing the high upsides of the city.\u201d He added: \u201cBut now you see it everywhere, and it\u2019s nowhere more apparent than here at Michigan Central.\u201d Creating beauty from blight The resurrection of Michigan Central Station was no small feat. \u201cIt was the most infamous symbol of Detroit\u2019s decline, the international poster child of \u2018ruin [photography],\u2019\u201d Dan Austin, Michigan Central\u2019s spokesperson who has long chronicled the city\u2019s architectural history on HistoricDetroit.org. Fifteen years ago, the station was the bleak and blighted backdrop for rap artist and native son Eminen\u2019s music video for \u201cBeautiful,\u201d a song about his struggles with drug addiction. The video began with the phrase, \u201cIn 1950, Michigan was 1 of 8 states in America that collectively produced 36% of the world\u2019s GNP. Detroit was the greatest manufacturing city in the world.\u201d When Ford bought Michigan Central Station in 2018 for $90 million, Chairman Bill Ford told CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow at the time that the building\u2019s decay was \u201clike a knife through my heart.\u201d The vision was to restore the building to its prior state of grandeur, outfit the ground floor with restaurants and retail \u2014 similar to the refurbishment of Denver\u2019s Union Station \u2014 and place offices and a hotel in the stories above. The neighboring building and surrounding acreage would be complementary to the task of creating a high-tech innovation district hubbed by Ford. During the past six years, more than 3,000 skilled tradespeople spent a combined 1.7 million hours to meticulously renovate the building. That painstaking work (including 450 hours dedicated to the hand-carving of a Corinthian column framing the main entrance) involved Ford Motor Company reopening an Indiana quarry that served as the source for the original limestone. \u201cThe amount of love poured into this thing, the attention to detail getting it right \u2026 I don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s ever been a restoration project of this scale,\u201d Austin said. When Michigan Central Station officially reopens this Thursday \u2014 with a sold-out concert produced by Eminem and boasting a lineup of Detroit performers including Diana Ross and Jack White, according to an announcement Monday \u2014 it will serve as the second act of Ford\u2019s billion-dollar innovation district. Last year, the neighboring Book Depository building was reopened as Newlab at Michigan Central, a tech hub for startups and early stage companies. Nearly 100 firms operate there today, including many bridging the energy, mobility and manufacturing sectors. The projects under way include developing streets that charge electric vehicles, robots that can handle last-mile deliveries and a \u201cGoogle Maps for drones.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really grown into an extraordinary and thriving ecosystem,\u201d said Josh Sirefman, CEO of Michigan Central Station. And with Michigan Central Station coming online, that\u2019s only expected to grow. \u201cThat\u2019s the poetry of those catalytic investments by Ford into physical assets that were symbols of both a past time and then of decline,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re the epicenter of this work that is positioning Detroit once again as a leader.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/economy/detroit-michigan-central-station/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_tech_tiktok-live-child-safety-utah-lawsuit", "text": "A new Utah lawsuit accuses TikTok of enabling the sexual exploitation of children through its livestreaming feature. TikTok live allows users to post live videos to the platform, where they can interact with viewers and respond to comments in real time. TikTok also allows viewers to send monetary \u201cgifts\u201d\u00a0\u2014\u00a0often represented by colorful emojis \u2014 to users conducting livestreams. TikTok does not allow users under the age of 18 to host livestreams. But the lawsuit, filed by Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes in state court in Utah, alleges that TikTok Live operates \u201clike a virtual strip club\u201d where children may be encouraged by adults to engage in \u201cillicit acts\u201d on camera in exchange for payments from other users. It also claims that TikTok has insufficient age verification and enforcement measures to ensure the app is being used safely. TikTok has known since before December 2023 that there are \u201cpervasive issues with transactional sexual content occurring during LIVE sessions, especially involving kids, through user complaints and internal safety reports,\u201d the complaint, filed Monday in Utah district court, states. TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement that the platform has \u201cindustry-leading policies and measures to help protect the safety and well-being of teens. Creators must be at least 18 years old before they can go LIVE, and their account must meet a follower requirement. We immediately revoke access to features if we find accounts that do not meet our age requirements.\u201d The Monday lawsuit is the second filed by Utah\u2019s attorney general against TikTok for allegedly putting children at risk. In a separate lawsuit last year, Utah accused the app of harming the mental health of young users, mirroring similar claims from Arkansas and New York City against TikTok and other social media platforms. TikTok has repeatedly pushed back on claims that it is harmful to children\u2019s wellbeing, saying it supports young users with various tools such as automatic time limits. It also comes as TikTok faces a potentially existential threat in the United States after President Joe Biden signed a law that requires the Chinese-owned app to be sold to a new company or be banned from US app stores. TikTok has sued to block the law, claiming it violates the First Amendment. The new Utah lawsuit, which is heavily redacted, claims TikTok has been aware of the misuse of its live feature but has failed to take adequate steps to address the issue. \u201cIn September 2022 \u2026 an investigator found that \u2018within minutes of browsing the [LIVE] feed\u2019 they were shown underage girls providing sexually suggestive content in exchange for money and young boys using filters to pose as girls to receive Gifts,\u201d the complaint states. The lawsuit also alleges that children may be manipulated into sending monetary gifts to other users on the live feature, with the promise of \u201clikes, shout outs, goods, or interactions\u201d from livestream hosts. Utah\u2019s attorney general is seeking a jury trial for the case.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/tech/tiktok-live-child-safety-utah-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_tech_russia-paris-olympics-influence-ops", "text": "Pro-Russian propagandists are ramping up their efforts to denigrate next month\u2019s Paris Summer Olympics and undermine Western support for Ukraine through a series of brazen online and offline stunts, private experts and Western officials told CNN. The stunts have included using artificial intelligence to impersonate the actor Tom Cruise\u2019s voice narrating a fake documentary attacking the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and placing coffins with an inscription invoking the Ukraine war near the Eiffel Tower, sources said. The activity appears to be part of an increasingly frantic effort from Russian operatives to tarnish the Olympics and stall any momentum Ukraine is building to use Western-made weapons to attack Russian territory, experts who track Russian disinformation told CNN. The IOC has placed restrictions on Russian athletes\u2019 participation in the Paris Olympics because of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. There is a mix of desperation and opportunism to the recent spate of propaganda, said Gavin Wilde, a former Russia expert at the National Security Council. \u201cFor the tech-savvy propagandists working in Russia, the alternative they\u2019re hedging against isn\u2019t irrelevance \u2014 it\u2019s a one-way trip to the front lines,\u201d Wilde told CNN. Russia\u2019s embassy in France called the allegations \u201cRussophobic.\u201d \u201cThe Embassy declares that the Russian Federation has never interfered and does not interfere in the internal affairs of France - our country has other more important priorities,\u201d the embassy said in a statement posted in French. \u201cThe Embassy urges the French authorities to put an end to this unfounded and unjustified anti-Russian disinformation campaign.\u201d Campaign to undermine the West The Russian operatives used the fake Cruise voice, the Netflix logo and even a fake New York Times review to try to lend the documentary legitimacy, according to analysts at Microsoft, who released a\u00a0report\u00a0on the activity on Sunday. The propaganda video, released on social media platform Telegram last year, was \u201cthe first glimpse of what would prove to be an extensive campaign\u201d by the same Russian propaganda actor to smear the Paris Olympics, Microsoft said. Russian propagandists have also been ginning up fake news stories claiming that Parisians are buying property insurance because of fears of terrorism around the Olympics, and fake press releases purporting to come from the CIA and French intelligence warning about terrorism, according to Microsoft. CNN has requested comment from the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC. Not all the recent subterfuge has been online. On Saturday, French police discovered five coffins draped in the French flag, with the words \u201cFrench soldiers in Ukraine,\u201d near the Eiffel Tower. A French military official told CNN they suspect that Russia was involved in the stunt. French police are questioning three men in connection with the incident. French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s refusal to rule out the possibility of sending French troops to Ukraine has\u00a0infuriated\u00a0the Russian government. In recent days, pro-Russia social media accounts have also shared a doctored video of US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller commenting on Ukraine\u2019s potential use of US-made weapons in Russia. The video appears to be compiled from two different press appearances by Miller, showing him wearing different ties. It\u2019s unclear who made the video. US officials and private experts have not publicly identified the source of the video. \u201cWhile this video is obviously fake, it is a step towards what counter-disinformation researchers have been warning about \u2013 the use of AI manipulated media to enhance foreign disinformation operations,\u201d the State Department said in a statement to CNN. The Russian Embassy in South Africa shared a version of the video on its X accounts,\u00a0according\u00a0to screenshots captured by a BBC journalist. Hany Farid, a digital forensic expert and professor at UC Berkley, said the video had hallmarks of being manipulate using AI. Farid ran the video through multiple deepfake detection systems and said they indicated that the voices in the video had been created using AI and that the lip movements of the State Department spokesperson in the video had been altered using lip-sync AI software. \u201cEven if the fake is not believed by everyone, the constant bombardment of deepfakes is leading to an overall skepticism of everything we see online,\u201d Farid said. But Lee Foster, another information operations expert, expressed skepticism that the imagery in the video was made using AI. \u201cLooking at it from an analytic standpoint, it doesn\u2019t make sense to use AI to manipulate mouth movements such that they are basically identical to the original,\u201d Foster told CNN. \u201cAI manipulation of the video\u2019s audio remains an unresolved question, however.\u201d Ghosts of Olympics past Russian antagonism toward the IOC has been years in the making. The IOC has prohibited Russian athletes from competing officially under the Russian flag in Paris because of the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russian athletes have faced similar restrictions at past Olympic games because of Russia\u2019s alleged doping program. Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency was behind a destructive cyberattack on computers used at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in South Korea in 2018,\u00a0according\u00a0to the US Justice Department. Officials at the Paris Olympics are bracing for a similar threat next month. \u201cThe GRU has reserved some its most serious cyberattacks for France and the Olympics, and they carried those out when the geopolitical situation was considerably less strained,\u201d said John Hultquist, chief analyst at the Google-owned cybersecurity firm Mandiant. The Olympic Games in Paris \u201cwill be an incredibly enticing target for these actors,\u201d Hultquist added. \u201cAny attack they cook up will be designed to undermine French prestige and the solidarity at the heart of the event.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/tech/russia-paris-olympics-influence-ops/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_media_wall-street-journal-biden-mental-acuity", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. The Wall Street Journal\u00a0owes its readers \u2014\u00a0and the public\u00a0\u2014 better. The business broadsheet\u00a0published and hyped a story\u00a0Wednesday declaring that \u201cbehind closed doors,\u201d\u00a0President Joe Biden\u00a0has shown \u201csigns of slipping.\u201d The story questioned Biden\u2019s mental acuity, playing into a GOP-propelled narrative that the 81-year-old president lacks the fitness to hold the nation\u2019s highest office. But an examination of the report reveals a glaring problem: Most of the sources reporters\u00a0Annie Linskey\u00a0and\u00a0Siobhan Hughes\u00a0relied on were Republicans. In fact, buried in the story, the reporters themselves acknowledged that they had drawn their sweeping conclusion based on GOP sources who, obviously, have an incentive to make comments that will damage Biden\u2019s candidacy. \u201cMost of those who said Biden performed poorly were Republicans, but some Democrats said that he showed his age in several of the exchanges,\u201d Linskey and Hughes conceded. The duo also noted that they had spoken to sources in the administration \u201cwho found no fault\u201d with the way Biden conducted himself in meetings for which they were present. Republicans accusing their political foe of lacking the mental fitness to hold office is nothing surprising. Such accusations are made every night on\u00a0Fox News. And\u00a0Donald Trump, who at 77 years old has also shown plenty of signs of waning mental faculties, including repeatedly falling asleep at his own high-stakes hush money trial, has made the accusation a centerpiece of his campaign. In other words, these accusations from the right aren\u2019t exactly news. \u201cIt\u2019s a little surprising that The Wall Street Journal thought it was breaking news when congressional Republicans told them the same false claims they\u2019ve spouted on Fox News for years,\u201d\u00a0White House\u00a0spokesperson\u00a0Andrew Bates\u00a0said, \u201cbut it\u2019s also telling that the only individuals willing to smear the President in this story are political opponents afraid to use their names \u2014 plus one proven liar.\u201d Even more inexplicable is why The Journal would quote former House Speaker\u00a0Kevin McCarthy\u00a0in the piece as a serious person speaking in good faith. McCarthy is, in fact, a MAGA Republican who has for years lied on behalf of Trump. I\u2019m sure reporters at The Journal would acknowledge McCarthy\u2019s extreme record of dishonesty in private. So why present him to readers as an honest arbiter of reality? The New York Times\u2019 Katie Rogers\u00a0and\u00a0Annie Karni\u00a0even reported\u00a0last year that McCarthy had praised Biden\u2019s mental faculties when speaking amongst confidantes \u2014 a starkly different tune than the one he is now singing in public. \u201cPrivately, Mr. McCarthy has told allies that he has found Mr. Biden to be mentally sharp in meetings,\u201d Rogers and Karni reported in March 2023. Rogers re-upped that reporting on Wednesday in the wake of The Journal\u2019s story. Bizarrely, while quoting McCarthy, The Journal apparently ignored on-the-record statements provided by high-ranking Democrats. Former House Speaker\u00a0Nancy Pelosi\u00a0disclosed that she spoke to the newspaper, but she was notably not quoted in the piece. Other Democrats went public on Wednesday with similar experiences. Instead, one of the only on-the-record quotes in the entire story was delivered by the former Republican leader who would lie about the color of the sky if it pleased Trump. \u201cThe Journal ignored testimony by Democrats, focused on attacks by Republicans and printed a hit piece,\u201d Pelosi protested on X. Hughes\u00a0responded to the criticism\u00a0Wednesday, telling\u00a0\u201cCNN News Central\u201d\u00a0that her job \u201cis to be the agent of the reader\u201d and that she is not going to \u201cpublish the quote provided to me or us by every single Democrat.\u201d A spokesperson for The Journal told me that the\u00a0Rupert Murdoch-owned newspaper, which is under the stewardship of newish editor\u00a0Emma Tucker, \u201cstands by its reporting.\u201d If Tucker is comfortable with such shoddy journalism, it is worrisome. It is difficult to imagine that the newspaper, or any outlet, would run a similar story declaring that Trump is \u201cslipping\u201d behind the scenes based on the word of top Democratic figures \u2014 despite the fact that the Democratic leadership has demonstrated a much stronger relationship with the truth in recent years than their Republican counterparts. More broadly speaking, The Journal\u2019s piece pointed to a continued problem roiling the news media as it covers the 2024 election. Trump is permitted to fall asleep in court and make nonsensical public statements on a routine basis without any serious questions raised about his mental acuity. Meanwhile, Biden is judged on an entirely different standard. Where are the stories about Trump\u2019s former inner circle raising questions about his mental fitness?\u00a0Alyssa Farah Griffin, who served as his communications director, has publicly stated that Trump is \u201cnot as sharp\u201d as he once was.\u00a0Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who served as ambassador to the\u00a0United Nations\u00a0under Trump, has also repeatedly raised issues about the Republican candidate\u2019s mental fitness, describing him as \u201cdeclining\u201d and \u201cdiminished\u201d and \u201cnot the same person he was in 2016.\u201d \u201cHope the Wall Street Journal feels free to reach out to any one of us who worked in the Trump Admin. Happy to discuss Trump\u2019s mental acuity & fitness for office,\u201d\u00a0Olivia Troye, a former Trump administration official, sarcastically wrote on X. \u201cWe can start with the closed doors discussions on milkshakes during intel briefings, windmills causing cancer, what bleach does & doesn\u2019t do & go from there.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/media/wall-street-journal-biden-mental-acuity/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}

America\u2019s middle class is feeling the heat from sky-high interest rates and persistent inflation. Middle-class income growth has lagged behind that of the upper class since 1970, according to a Pew Research Center report published May 31. The report defines middle-income households as having incomes that are two-thirds to twice that of the US median household income. The income figures are adjusted for household size.  Now, the cost-of-living crisis is exacerbating that long-term squeeze. \u201cThe economy is booming, and yet many Americans are still gasping for air financially. They simply don\u2019t have the breathing room to plan beyond their present needs,\u201d said Jennifer Jones Austin, co-chair of the National True Cost of Living Coalition, in a release. There are signs that middle-class Americans are dialing back their spending. Fast food joints, a mainstay dining destination for middle-income consumers, are leaning into discounts to placate frustrated diners. That comes after restaurants raised their menu prices as inflation soared, betting that customers would still be willing to spend. But that wager soured as diners tightened their purse strings, leading to less foot traffic and lower sales for fast food chains. Target, which has a core middle-class customer base, reported in May that sales at stores open for at least a year dropped 3.7% during its latest quarter from the prior year. That marked its fourth consecutive quarter of sales declines. Kohl\u2019s that same month reported weak first-quarter results, underlining how middle-income consumers are pulling back spending on non-essential clothing and discretionary merchandise at department stores. \u201cOur customers continue to be pressured by a number of economic factors, including high interest rates and inflation,\u201d Kohl\u2019s CEO Thomas Kingsbury said on a May 30 call with analysts. \u201cOur middle-income customer continues to be impacted.\u201d Economic data and corporate earnings reports have shown that lower-income consumers are struggling to pay their bills on time, reducing their spending and searching for deals. Wealthier Americans, who have helped support the economy\u2019s strength through high interest rates, are also starting to reel in their purchases. There are other signals that many consumers are facing financial woes. US home prices are at record highs. Americans are racking up debt and running low on savings accumulated during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Thousands of corporate layoffs have some Americans struggling to make ends meet saying they feel as though they are living in a recession. Americans have for months grappled with a divergence between the way they feel about the economy and how the economy looks on paper. But cooling economic data has begun to narrow that gap. US job growth slowed considerably in April, with just 175,000 positions added after a slew of piping hot jobs reports. Activity in the US manufacturing sector continued to contract in May. Data released Tuesday revealed that the number of US job openings shrank for the second straight month in April, setting a new three-year low. Wall Street will get its next look at the state of the economy on Friday when the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports payroll figures for May. Why India\u2019s election shock won\u2019t derail its economic boom Narendra Modi has declared victory in India\u2019s election, but he\u2019ll need the support of smaller parties to govern, a shock result that could make it harder for him to pass major economic reforms, reports my colleague Diksha Madhok. India boomed during Modi\u2019s first two terms as prime minister, leapfrogging the United Kingdom to become the world\u2019s fifth biggest economy and growing by 8.2% in the last fiscal year. But the new government will need to make more big changes to sustain that pace if India is to become an economic superpower and a manufacturing rival to China. \u201cWith a more fragmented government, we believe policy making in general is going to become more difficult going forward,\u201d said Peeyush Mittal, a portfolio manager at Matthews Asia, a San Francisco-based investment fund. Experts have highlighted land reform as an example of policies that might now be tougher for Modi to implement. Companies face more barriers to accessing land in India than in China. It is also much harder to hire or fire workers. India will need to address those issues if it is to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington. Despite the surprise electoral setback for Modi\u2019s right-wing, Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party\u00a0(BJP), experts say the world\u2019s fastest growing major economy will continue to live up to its billing. \u201cThe Modi administration still has enough of a mandate to enact reforms that will keep potential growth at 6% to 7%,\u201d\u00a0Shilan Shah, an economist at Capital Economics, said in a note on Tuesday. \u201cThat would leave the economy on course to more than double in size over the next decade.\u201d Read more here. What happened to the UK economy? When UK voters elect a new government on July 4, the health of the world\u2019s sixth-biggest economy will likely be the main factor in deciding the outcome, reports my colleague Hanna Ziady. The Conservative Party of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has been in office since 2010, a period that has included the twin shocks of a pandemic and war in Ukraine. But the United Kingdom has also been held back by two self-inflicted wounds \u2014 deep austerity in the wake of the global financial crisis and the 2016 decision to quit the European Union, which raised new barriers to trade. Economic growth has been anemic in recent years, squeezing living standards and starving public services of funds. In their first televised debate Tuesday, Sunak and Keir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, clashed over Britain\u2019s economic fortunes, taxes, immigration and the state of the National Health Service. The stakes are high: Opinion polls suggest the Conservatives are set to be booted from office, with Labour on course to win a UK election for the first time since Tony Blair took the party to victory in 2005. Sunak pointed to rising wages and a strengthening economy as proof that his plan to \u201crestore economic stability\u201d is working. Starmer, meanwhile, attacked the Conservative Party for presiding over 14 years of economic decline.

{"id": "2024_06_05_tech_palestinian-american-sues-meta-instagram", "text": "A Palestinian-American engineer has sued the social media giant Meta, accusing his former employer of discriminating against pro-Palestinian speech on its platforms and of wrongfully firing him after he investigated the issue as part of his official duties. The lawsuit by Ferras Hamad \u2014 a Meta engineer assigned to review Instagram content filters related to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine \u2014 claims Meta fired him because of his Palestinian background and for raising concerns about the company\u2019s handling of a prominent Palestinian war photographer\u2019s Instagram account. The lawsuit highlights how divisions over the conflict in Gaza have not only played out on social media but also, according to Hamad, within the companies that operate those same online platforms. \u201cThe employee was dismissed for violating Meta\u2019s data access policies, which we make clear to employees will result in immediate termination,\u201d Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement to CNN. According to the complaint filed Tuesday in California state court in Santa Clara County, the photographer\u2019s account, with more than 17 million followers, had been incorrectly labeled as pornographic. When Hamad flagged the matter late last year to colleagues within the same team, he allegedly began to receive communications from Meta employees outside of the team pressuring him to drop the investigation. While trying to understand the photographer\u2019s case, Hamad claims he \u201cfollowed the guidance provided for debugging such issues, including checking the publicly accessible posts of the user.\u201d Weeks later, following an employment investigation, Hamad was abruptly fired, the lawsuit said, with Meta allegedly claiming that Hamad had violated the company\u2019s user-data access policies despite both his manager and Meta\u2019s security team affirming that no policy violations had occurred. The firing took place against the backdrop of other examples of company bias against pro-Palestinian speech, Hamad alleges. Those examples include situations where Meta allegedly deleted employees\u2019 internal posts mentioning deaths of relatives in Gaza; mentions of Palestinian refugees from an internal group dedicated to refugee support; and an internal letter from employees to Meta executives flagging concerns about Meta\u2019s moderation of content related to Palestinians, Muslims and Arabs, according to the complaint. The lawsuit also cites a December 2023 report by Human Rights Watch\u00a0documenting claims that Meta\u00a0unreasonably suppressed peaceful\u00a0pro-Palestinian speech. Hamad \u201cwas scrutinized, interrogated, and terminated because he was of Palestinian national origin and/or Muslim investigating a SEV [severe issue] related to one of the most famous Palestinian photojournalists during the conflict in Gaza,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. As part of the suit, Hamad is accusing Meta of illegal discrimination, harassment, retaliation and wrongful termination, requesting a jury trial to determine damages he has suffered including lost income and benefits as well as lost career opportunities and undue stress.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/tech/palestinian-american-sues-meta-instagram/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can \u201clisten\u201d to people\u2019s questions and converse in real time. \u201cShellie\u201d can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while \u201cArif\u201d is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_business_sunak-starmer-debate-uk-election", "text": "The UK Treasury has flatly contradicted Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s claim that its impartial officials had calculated that the opposition Labour Party would \u201cput up everyone\u2019s taxes by \u00a32,000.\u201d Sunak made the claim during a televised debate Tuesday ahead of July\u2019s election, as he and Labour leader Keir Starmer clashed on issues ranging from the cost-of-living and immigration, to the state of the National Health Service. \u201cIndependent Treasury officials have costed Labour\u2019s policies and they amount to a \u00a32,000 tax rise for every working family,\u201d Sunak said. The Conservative Party leader later repeated the claim. On the eve of the debate, James Bowler, the most senior civil servant in the Treasury, said officials in his department had not been involved in producing that number, contained in a Conservative Party campaign document. In a letter dated June 3, a copy of which was posted to X by senior Labour Party official Darren Jones, Bowler wrote that \u201ccivil servants were not involved in the production or presentation of the Conservative Party\u2019s document \u2018Labour\u2019s Tax Rises\u2019 or in the calculation of the total figure used.\u201d The campaign document claims that Labour would have to find \u00a338.5 billion ($49.2 billion) to meet all of its spending commitments, either borrowing the money or raising taxes by \u201c\u00a32,094 per working household over the next four years.\u201d It states that \u201calmost every costing contained here has been conducted by (the) Treasury.\u201d In his letter to Labour, Bowler said he had cautioned senior Conservative Party officials and advisers against suggesting that the \u00a338.5 billion figure was based on Treasury analysis. He said that \u201cany costings derived from other sources or produced by other organisations should not be presented as having been produced by the Civil Service,\u201d adding that he had \u201creminded Ministers and advisers that this should be the case.\u201d The Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) has since investigated Sunak\u2019s comments.  In a statement Thursday, it said it would not comment on whether the \u00a32,000 number was accurate or not, but added that someone hearing the claim \u2014 without reading the Conservative Party\u2019s full campaign document \u2014 \u201cwould have no way of knowing that this is an estimate summed together over four years.\u201d \u201cWe warned against this practice a few days ago,\u201d the statistics watchdog added. OSR chair Robert Chote had already written to party leaders on Tuesday, urging them to ensure that statistics are used in an \u201cappropriate and transparent\u201d manner during the election campaign and not in a way \u201cthat has the potential to mislead.\u201d Labour says Sunak \u2018lied\u2019 Opinion polls, meanwhile, are divided about who won the debate Tuesday. A YouGov snap poll of 1,657 viewers, showed 51% thought Sunak performed better, compared to 49% for Starmer. But in a poll of 1,153 viewers by market research firm Savanta, 44% gave the debate to Starmer, while 39% voted for Sunak and 17% were undecided. Bowler\u2019s letter could undermine Sunak\u2019s claim to lead with integrity \u2014 a pledge made when he became prime minister in October 2022 \u2014 as he battles a high-stakes election. Opinion\u00a0polls suggest the Conservatives are set to be booted from office, with Labour on course to win a UK election for the first time since 2005. In a statement Wednesday, Labour said Sunak had \u201clied eleven times to the British people\u201d about the party\u2019s tax plans. \u201cLabour will not raise taxes on working people. It\u2019s the Tories who have made \u00a371 billion of unfunded promises that will mean higher taxes and higher borrowing,\u201d the party wrote in an emailed campaign message. During the debate Tuesday, Starmer dismissed the \u00a32,000 ($2,560) figure as \u201cnonsense\u201d and said it was based on \u201cpretend\u201d Labour policies. A Conservative Party spokesperson said that its document on Labour\u2019s tax plans \u201cused clear Labour policies, their own costings or official (Treasury) costings using the lowest assumptions.\u201d In a statement shared with CNN, the spokesperson added: \u201cIt is now for Labour to explain which of the policies which were Labour policy no longer are Labour policy.\u201d \u2014 Luke McGee contributed reporting.

{"id": "2024_06_03_business_dr-pepper-pepsi", "text": "Coke is still the top soda in America. But the runner up spot, long held by Pepsi, now belongs to Dr Pepper. After years of slowly gaining market share, Dr Pepper inched ahead of Pepsi as the number two soda brand in the country in 2023, according to market share data from Beverage Digest, a trade publication. Coke is the leader by a comfortable margin. Last year, it captured 19.2% of the soda market in the United States by volume, Beverage Digest\u2019s data shows. Dr Pepper and Pepsi both had 8.3%, with Dr Pepper technically ahead. After that came other brands owned by Coca-Cola: Sprite came in at 8.1% and Diet Coke at 7.8%. While \u201cDr Pepper has been gaining, [Pepsi] has been declining, and they\u2019re meeting in the middle,\u201d said Duane Stanford, editor of Beverage Digest, in an interview with CNN. Over the years, the peppery soda \u2014 with its claimed blend of 23 flavors \u2014 has been growing in popularity, leaning into its identity as a spicy alternative to cola and taking advantage of broader trends. Founded in 1885 in Waco, Texas, Dr Pepper preceded both Coca-Cola and Pepsi. And while the two cola giants battled it out in the 20th century, Dr Pepper established a small but devoted following in the American South. For years a regional favorite, Dr Pepper in the 1970s marketed itself to a national audience as a unique flavor. Over the years, it has gained traction with a national audience. Today, Dr Pepper is experimenting with new flavors. The brand introduced Dr Pepper Strawberries & Cream last year. The addition was \u201ca standout success,\u201d Timothy Cofer, CEO of Dr Pepper parent company Keurig Dr Pepper, said during an analyst call in April. The brand has also rolled out trendy limited-time flavors, like Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut, inspired by TikTok\u2019s dirty soda trend (mixing soda with milk or cream and other flavors). But the brand doesn\u2019t have to do too much to be on trend. \u201cSwicy,\u201d or sweet and spicy, items are taking over the food and beverage aisle. Even Coca-Cola wants in: The company in February introduced Coca-Cola Spiced, a rare permanent addition to the lineup of Coke flavors. Pepsi, on the other hand, may have been too focused on its other brands. Unlike Coca-Cola and Keurig Dr Pepper, Pepsico has a massive food business \u2014 its sprawling portfolio includes Quaker, Frito-Lay and more. And when it comes to beverages, Stanford noted, it seems to be focused on its zero sugar lines rather than classic Pepsi. \u201cThey\u2019re leading with that now,\u201d Stanford said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/business/dr-pepper-pepsi/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}

The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_business_sears-stores-converted-into-entertainment-centers", "text": "In Florida, a handful of dead mall anchor Sears stores, left vacant and unmoored by the iconic retailer\u2019s bankruptcy six years ago, are being jolted back to life. They won\u2019t be resurrected into new stores, but they\u2019re definitely being primed, one company hopes, to pull in plenty of families who\u2019ll find it hard to resist spending money again in these big-box spaces. That\u2019s because even as households are skimping on buying more stuff, they are opening their wallets to eating out and entertaining themselves at places such as concerts and amusement parks. Michele Oca, founder of Tampa, Florida-based design and marketing firm US Design Lab, specializes in conceptualizing, restyling and jumpstarting empty commercial spaces by packing them with fun. \u201cThink bowling alleys, arcade games, rope courses, go-kart tracks, mini golf, laser tag,\u201d he said in an interview with CNN. Encircling all of these attractions are restaurants and bars. Oca\u2019s client, real estate investment firm E8 Properties, has been buying empty Sears stores, dusting them off and converting them into \u201cElev8 Fun,\u201d a massive indoor family entertainment park created in partnership with Primetime Amusements, a provider of video arcade machine. The first one, designed by Oca and his team and housed in a 120,000-square-foot former Sears building attached to the Seminole Town Center Mall in Sanford, Florida, opened in January 2022. Since then, E8 Properties (which develops family entertainment centers) continues to expand Elev8 Fun in Florida. Oca said all venues Elev8 Fun uses are converted commercial spaces of more than 100,000 square feet. The company\u2019s second space, also in a former Sears store, opened at the Citrus Park Mall in Tampa in May 2023, while a third location \u2014 in a converted Sears at the Treasure Coast Square Mall in Jensen Beach \u2014 is expected to open next summer. A fourth planned location, at a former Kohl\u2019s store at the Miami International Mall in Miami is expected to open in late 2025. Entertainment over shopping Adding more entertainment versus shopping tenants to malls could be an effective way to not only pull in more visitors as malls strive to stay relevant to younger shoppers, but also  fill empty real estate space that could be immune to the shopping mall\u2019s scourge of online shopping. People can\u2019t order a go-kart track off of Amazon, after all. \u201cIf you take a look at year-over-year retail sales growth by different categories, department stores, furniture, sporting goods, electronics retailers, those are the typical mall tenants that are being eaten up by ecommerce options whereas the experiential things are really bringing in the foot traffic,\u201d said Victor Calanog, managing director, global co-head of research and strategy, real estate, with Manulife Investment Management. Fun experiences, such as indoor amusement parks, arcades, pickleball courts and escape room adventures are what economists categorize as \u201cnon-traded goods.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t exactly buy them or replicate them online, you need to experience them yourself,\u201d Calanog said. \u201cI do think it\u2019s as good of a strategy as any, and then it becomes an execution issue and how well these concepts are marketed to bring in the families as an entertainment destination.\u201d To his point, increasingly, more malls are morphing into family entertainment destinations where shopping may not even be what draws shoppers in. Industry analysts said research shows that adding entertainment experiences shifts more money to mall retailers and not away from them. Through the pandemic and coming out of it, the popularity of pickleball made its way into malls with courts popping up next to skating rinks. Indoor skydiving, Legoland theme parks, virtual golf and microbreweries are other concepts catching on. Calanog said there is a reckoning that physical stores, and not just malls in general, \u201care trying to figure out what is our unique value proposition versus other substitutes.\u201d Still, whether it\u2019s a Sears or a defunct Kohl\u2019s store, taking an empty shell of a large department store to repurpose it into something completely different isn\u2019t easy. \u201cThere are many unique challenges. Those stores have a lot of columns and it wasn\u2019t easy to fit attractions like Go-Karts and bowling through those columns,\u201d said Oca. The completed Elev8 Fun projects, he said, took over a year to build and cost more than $15 million on average per location, including buying the empty space to refurbish and retrofit with multiple attractions. \u201cWe didn\u2019t just create the layout and look and feel of the space, we also created the brand name and logo of this new entertainment chain concept for our client,\u201d he said. The team also studied the local demographic and competitors to decide which attractions made sense to include in each new Elev8 Fun center. \u201cIf there was already a big bowling center a couple of blocks away I wasn\u2019t going to put bowling in the Elev8 Fun location near it,\u201d he said. The only real competition in family entertainment in Sanford was about 30 minutes away in Orlando with Walt Disney World and Universal Studios. \u201cSanford was a pretty virgin market but it has a large residential area. So we decided to put all of the attractions that we could into that former Sears store,\u201d Oca said. At the Tampa Mall location, Oca expanded the fun outside by adding an outdoor rope course outside of the renovated Sears building in addition to all of the indoor activities. Jim Hull, founder of Hull Property Group, which owns the Citrus Park Mall in Tampa, told CNN that mall owners and operators need to relentlessly pursue compelling ideas to keep mall goers entertained and spending money. \u201cElev8 Fun passes the first test of being well conceived. It also passes the second test of making a prominent statement,\u201d said Hull. \u201cIt\u2019s a transformational facility that is clever, inspirational and aspirational.\u201d Hull estimates that Citrus Park Mall has seen about a 5% bump in sales from the addition of the indoor park in the old Sears store. \u201cBut it\u2019s so dependent on good stewardship, on relentlessly pursuing their business and their customers,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure everyone coming in there will cross shop the mall. I don\u2019t really want anyone in the mall who is not shopping. We are very disciplined about that but we are also very interested in facilitating the overall experience of our customers,\u201d Hull said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/business/sears-stores-converted-into-entertainment-centers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_business_lululemon-is-at-a-crossroads", "text": "Lululemon, maker of the pricey yogawear sported by seemingly everyone from Pilates moms to college students to preteens in the US, is at a crossroads. For over a decade, the company has fought off competitors like Athleta and Nike to dominate the luxury athleisure market, managing to grow despite the lightning rod of controversies that followed its founder. Its soft, colorful, $98 leggings and viral beltbags have attracted an even younger demographic, a huge plus for any retailer. But, while the skin-tight look shot Lululemon to fame, it now must navigate a new, baggy pant-loving Gen Z demographic and the radical reshuffling of its own executive team. Lulu stock is down almost 40% year to date but rose more than 10% after hours on Wednesday, after slightly topping analyst revenue expectations in its first quarter 2024 earnings. Macroeconomic headwinds are hitting many peer retailers, of course. But Lulu is also coping with the addition of trendy, celebrity and influencer-backed competitors like Alo, which is known for its monochromatic, chic sets, and Vuori, which carved out a space for itself in men\u2019s athleticwear. And the company blamed its slower North American sales on its own actions: It just didn\u2019t have enough sizes and colors in stock for its youngest customers. Lulu recently announced that its chief product officer \u2013 considered by Wall Street a key engine of its success \u2013 was leaving just ahead of its first quarter earnings release Wednesday. As part of that release, Lululemon said it was raising its stock repurchase program by $1 billion, which could help calm down investors who are worried abut slowed growth. The company also maintained a brighter outlook for the year, saying it expects its net revenue to be between $10.7 billion and $10.8 billion. A departure shakes the firm Sun Choe, who had been Lululemon\u2019s creative mastermind, recently resigned to join Vans as its global brand president. The departure of the company\u2019s chief product officer adds to a \u201cwall of worry\u201d Raymond James analysts said. Choe joined Lululemon more than seven years ago and became chief product officer in 2018, according to her LinkedIn. Raymond James analysts credit Lululemon\u2019s success with strong products and marketing to Choe\u2019s role at the company. Shares fell as much as 7% on May 22 upon news of her departure. She left big shoes to fill, Wedbush analyst Tom Nikic told CNN. Under Choe, there was \u201cconstant innovation and newness, whether it\u2019s new fabrics or getting into new product categories.\u201d There\u2019s a reason Wall Street responded so negatively to Choe\u2019s departure. \u201cI think that there\u2019s a lot of people out there who believe that she was the person behind the scenes and was the most instrumental to Lululemon\u2019s success,\u201d Nikic said. Competition on both sides The fashion the company was known for has already been on the way out, Jefferies analysts warned. They \u201cbelieve the company\u2019s product assortment is falling flat.\u201d Lululemon is getting walled in by two very different types of competitors. On one end is those rapidly expanding luxury yogawear brands Alo and Vuori, who have been opening stores  near existing Lululemon locations. And then there\u2019s the culture of dupes, which claim leggings just as soft as Lulu\u2019s can be purchased for a fraction of the price. Lulu has been\u00a0\u201chyper aware\u201d of dupe culture, Nikki Neuburger, then its Chief Brand Officer, previously said in an interview with CNN Business. So much so that the brand hosted a dupe swap at the Century City Mall in Los Angeles. Bring in a knock-off pair, Lulu said, and they\u2019ll swap it out for the black Align High Rise Pant 25\u2019. That wasn\u2019t enough to quell knock-off popularity. As Americans cut back spending due to inflation and rising prices, many view a $90 pair of leggings as an unnecessary expense. And for those who can still shell out the money, Lululemon faces steep competition. Alo shot to popularity after celebrities from Hailey Bieber to Martha Stewart were photographed in the trendy brand. Vuori has a $400 million investment by Softbank and said it had bullish plans to open more than 100 stores in the US in the next five years. Time to turn it around Lululemon\u2019s demographic has shifted \u2013 originally marketed toward suburban women in their 30s and 40s, its stores are increasingly filled with younger, close to preteen-aged shoppers. In its Q4 earnings call in March, Lululemon said it had seen strong sales of its smaller sizes and colorful offerings. However, Lululemon wasn\u2019t stocked enough in these smaller sizes, which could have led these younger shoppers to competitors, Nikic said. But these are quick fixable problems, Nikic said. CEO Calvin McDonald made clear the company was still focused on pursuing\u00a0its new core customer in its last earnings call. (Lululemon has not responded to request for comment for this story in advance of their Wednesday earnings.) Lululemon also has potential for growth in its men\u2019s sector and international business. Unlike athletic brands like Nike that have a huge international footprint, Lululemon\u2019s international business represented only 21% of its business at the end of 2023. The company said in the fourth quarter that its mainland China revenue increased 78%, compared to North America\u2019s revenue increase of 9%. \u201cI certainly would not say that hope is lost with this company. This is a company that has a long track record of success,\u201d Nikic said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/business/lululemon-is-at-a-crossroads/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}

The AI chipmaker\u2019s market capitalization rose to $3.019 trillion on Wednesday, nudging slightly past Apple\u2019s also $2.99 trillion market cap and making it the second-largest publicly traded company in the US by that measure, just behind Microsoft\u2019s market cap of $3.15 trillion. Nvidia is now the third company in the US, behind Apple and Microsoft, to cross that $3 trillion mark. Shares of the Santa Clara-based chipmaker rose 5.2% to about $1,224.4 a share, while Apple shares ended the session up 0.8% at $196. Those gains also helped boost the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq indexes on Wednesday \u2013 both closed at new record highs. Nvidia (NVDA) has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI mania dominating Wall Street this year; the stock is up 147% so far this year after soaring 239% in 2023. Apple shares, meanwhile, have gained about 1.7% year-to-date. Earlier this week, Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, said that the company would roll out its most advanced AI chip platform, called Rubin, in 2026. The Rubin platform will succeed the Blackwell, which supplies chips for data centers and was announced only\u00a0in March. It was dubbed by Nvidia at the time as the \u201cworld\u2019s most powerful chip.\u201d Nvidia accounts for around 70% of AI semiconductor sales and some analysts think the stock has further to go. \u201cAs we look ahead, we think NVDA is on pace to become the most valuable company, given the plethora of ways it can monetize AI and our belief that it has the largest addressable market expansion opportunity across the Tech sector,\u201d wrote Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research in a note on Wednesday evening. Shares of the company will soon become more affordable. Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split last month, making buying shares in the red-hot semiconductor company more accessible for individual\u00a0investors.

{"id": "2024_06_03_investing_stocks-ism-economy-updates", "text": "Wall Street\u2019s wild day ended on a calmer note. The Dow slid 115 points, or 0.3%, on Monday after falling by more than 400 points earlier in the day. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.6% to close out the first trading day of June. That comes after the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index clocked in at 48.7% in May, down from 49.2% in April. A reading below 50 indicates signs of contraction in the US manufacturing industry, while a reading above that level signals expansion. \u201cToday could mark a significant turning point in equity markets. In recent months, investors have cheered weaker-than-estimated data based on expectations that it could accelerate the start of the Fed\u2019s policy loosening. Investors are now reacting to soft data with fear,\u201d wrote Jos\u00e9 Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, in a Monday note. US Treasury yields fell on Monday. The 10-year yield declined to 4.4% as of 3 pm ET, according to Tradeweb. Investors have in recent weeks grappled with data that suggests inflation is continuing to run hot while the economy is cooling. That has spurned concerns that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates higher for longer than expected, in turn sending stocks swinging. Still, all major stock indexes in May cinched their sixth winning month in seven. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, showed Friday that inflation stayed stubbornly high in March. PCE rose 0.3% on a monthly basis and 2.7% from the year prior, according to Commerce Department data. New gross domestic product data released last Thursday showed that the US economy expanded at a weaker pace earlier this year than initially reported. The Commerce Department\u2019s second estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product registered at a 1.3% annualized rate, below the 1.6% reflected in the first estimate, largely due to a downward revision to consumer spending. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are going into a recession, but we are normalizing,\u201d said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist. Elsewhere, the New York Stock Exchange said Monday that a technical issue that halted trading for some stocks and caused Berkshire Hathaway shares to be down 99.97% has been resolved. GameStop shares popped 21% on Monday after a Reddit\u00a0post\u00a0by Keith Gill, also known as \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d showing a screenshot of a stake in the video game stock worth nearly $116 million.

Red Lobster said that it had more than $1 billion in debt and less than $30 million in cash on hand.

{"id": "2024_06_05_investing_texas-stock-exchange", "text": "Texas\u2019 famous longhorns are coming for Wall Street\u2019s bulls. A new national stock exchange, based in Dallas, and backed by Wall Street heavyweights like BlackRock and Citadel Securities, is looking to take on the world-famous New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. The newly formed TXSE Group announced its plans to file for registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission later this year. The group is backed by more than two dozen investors with $120 million in funding \u2013 that makes it the most well-capitalized exchange entrant to even file with the SEC. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to bring to fruition the long-held vision for a national stock exchange in Texas,\u201d\u00a0TXSE Group founder and CEO James Lee said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cTexas and the other states in the southeast quadrant have become economic powerhouses. Combined with the demand we are seeing from investors and corporations for expanded alternatives to trade and list equities, this is an opportune time to build a major, national stock exchange in Texas.\u201d The group said it was hoping to benefit from the more than 5,200 private equity-sponsored companies in the region that may want to go public. Lee told\u00a0The Wall Street Journal that the group hopes to officially launch its exchange in 2026. The problem with going public America has lost half its public companies since the 1990s. Back in 1996, there were 8,000 companies on US exchanges. Today that count has dropped by more than 50% to just 3,700, according to\u00a0data from\u00a0the Center for Research in Security Prices. It\u2019s not that America has half as many companies as 30 years ago \u2013 it\u2019s that companies are increasingly staying private, largely outside the scrutiny of the public eye and markets. Intensified reporting requirements, higher litigation expenses, costly regulations, overbearing board governance, shareholder activism, heightened public scrutiny and the pressure of quarterly earnings have driven companies away from public markets. There are now about five times as many private equity-backed firms in the US as there are\u00a0publicly held companies, according to economists at Wells Fargo. The trend has been growing for some time. In 1999, the average US technology firm transitioned to the public markets after four years, Wells Fargo research shows. By 2019, that figure increased to 11 years. \u201cCompanies that remain private can avoid the burden and cost of regulatory requirements and focus on long-term strategic plans,\u201d they wrote. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, expressed worry about the changes in his annual shareholder letter in April. \u201cThis trend is serious,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe really need to consider: Is this the outcome we want?\u201d The TXSE Group said in a press release on Wednesday that it hopes to help relieve some of that burden. \u201cTXSE\u2019s planned launch comes as changes in the equity markets provide an opportunity for greater alignment and more competition,\u201d they wrote. \u201cCorporate issuers and exchange-traded product sponsors are demanding more stability and predictability around listing standards and associated costs. TXSE intends to expand access to US capital markets for all investors, while providing greater access and alignment for public companies and those seeking access to public capital.\u201d While the most popular exchanges in the US are located in New York City, there are about 13 stock exchanges around the country including in Philadelphia and Miami. This exchange, said Lee, would mostly function to list businesses located in Texas and the southeast quadrant of the United States.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/investing/texas-stock-exchange/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_business_nfl-sunday-ticket-antitrust-suit", "text": "A class action case challenging the legality of the NFL\u2019s Sunday Ticket package, whose opening arguments are scheduled for Thursday, could shake up television rights deals in professional sports and the way teams make money. The case, first brought in 2015, focuses on the NFL\u2019s package of games outside of a local market that are not shown nationally on other networks. The suit says by restricting broadcasts of those \u201cout-of-market\u201d games to the Sunday Ticket package, the NFL is forcing customers who just want to watch one team or a small group of teams have to pay more. \u201cGiven the relatively low cost of internet streaming and satellite and cable television carriage, each team acting independently would offer their games at a competitive price to anybody in the country who wanted to watch that particular team,\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys argued in a filing. \u201cInstead, however, the teams have all forgone this option in favor of creating a more lucrative monopoly.\u201d The plaintiffs are seeking billions in possible damages, which could be tripled under antitrust law. The NFL argues that the current arrangement offers the broadest possible selection of games for fans at a good value. Among the witnesses who could be called in the case are NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, team owners Jerry Jones and Robert Kraft as well as executives from various television networks and DirecTV, which had held the exclusive Sunday Ticket package until it lost it to Google-owned YouTube TV at the start of last season, at a reported cost of $2 billion a year. YouTube charges fans $449 a year for the package. The case, being heard in federal court in Los Angeles, was dismissed by a district court in 2017, then reinstated by the US Court of Appeals in 2019. It is being argued by lawyers from Susman Godfrey, a major national firm that settled the case against Fox News by Dominion Voting Systems for more than $787 million just before that case went to trial. The NFL has been known to settle some high profile cases against it rather than having its practices disclosed and dissected in open court. Those include a $790 million settlement that ended a suit by plaintiffs in St. Louis who objected to the relocation of the Rams to Los Angeles in 2016 and a $765 million settlement reached in 2013 that set up a fund to compensate players who suffered brain injuries from concussions during playing days.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/business/nfl-sunday-ticket-antitrust-suit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}

OPB called Smolkin a forward-thinking journalist and a strong business strategist who can help lead the 100-year-old public media organization through a difficult environment for the journalism industry \u2013 and public media, in particular. \u201cAs we celebrated our first 100 years, we were looking for a dynamic leader to chart the way forward during this time of transformational change in media,\u201d said Rukaiyah Adams, chair of OPB\u2019s board of directors. \u201cRachel will advance our work with deep experience in journalism, wide professional networks and adaptive leadership skills.\u201d Smolkin joined CNN in 2014 to lead politics coverage for CNN Digital. She was instrumental in transforming CNN\u2019s digital news coverage for the modern era, in which media consumers are getting information from multiple platforms and mobile devices. Over the past several years, Smolkin\u2019s purview grew to include national, international, business and live news for CNN Digital. She also spearheaded an innovative approach to US election coverage that provided CNN\u2019s audience with up-to-the-minute news about races across the country, no matter what screen or technology they used.  \u201cRachel has been an exceptional leader and partner, recruiting and supporting talented, diverse journalists across the network,\u201d said Virginia Moseley, CNN\u2019s executive editor, in a memo to staff. \u201cShe\u2019s helped develop our breaking news brand, emphasized service journalism, and made explainers and fact checks a core part of our storytelling.\u201d Smolkin takes over OPB at a challenging time for the industry. The digital and broadcast advertising markets that helped fund media organizations have shrunk sharply over the past several years, as people shift their news consumption habits to social media apps and other nontraditional sources. Artificial intelligence, a once far-off threat, has made stunning advances in recent years that also threatens to upend the business model of traditional journalism. CNN, like other media companies, has been challenged by the same disruptions. CEO Mark Thompson, who joined the network in 2023, outlined a plan in January to change the company for the future, urging the company to \u201crecapture some of the swagger and innovation of the early CNN.\u201d OPB\u2019s contributions from donors have grown over the past decade. But the broadcaster and Smolkin, who completed a master of business administration degree from the University of Virginia\u2019s Darden School of Business while she was an executive at CNN, suggested that OPB needed new creative thinking to ensure it can serve its audience\u2019s needs in the future. \u201cI am honored to lead OPB in its next chapter serving Oregon and the Pacific Northwest,\u201d Smolkin said. \u201cI am energized by the commitment the board has shown for building news and public affairs programming for all Oregonians and Southwest Washingtonians, for leading conversations about solving our most urgent challenges and for innovating new ways to connect with communities.\u201d Smolkin will replace Steve Bass, OPB\u2019s CEO since 2006, who announced his retirement last year. She will begin her new role in September. Before joining CNN, Smolkin worked at Politico, USA Today and the American Journalism Review.

{"id": "2024_06_06_tech_ftc-microsofts-ai-investigation", "text": "The Federal Trade Commission is investigating a recent Microsoft deal with artificial intelligence startup Inflection, according to a person familiar with the matter, as US antitrust regulators ramp up scrutiny of the red-hot AI industry. Microsoft announced in March that it had\u00a0hired Inflection\u2019s co-founders\u00a0and a number of its staff to lead its Copilot program, and Inflection said its AI model\u00a0would be hosted\u00a0on Microsoft\u2019s cloud platform. As part of that deal, Microsoft was\u00a0said to have paid Inflection $650 million. In its announcement at the time, Microsoft described the move as merely a hiring decision, not as an acquisition. The FTC probe into Microsoft concerns whether the company\u2019s investment in Inflection constituted an acquisition that Microsoft failed to disclose to the government, one of the people said. The investigation comes as antitrust officials at the FTC and the Justice Department are nearing a final agreement this week on how to jointly oversee AI giants such as Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, OpenAI and others, two people familiar with the matter told CNN. That agreement, which could be finalized within days, would appoint DOJ as the lead investigator of Nvidia, while the FTC would take responsibility for investigating Microsoft and OpenAI, the people said. DOJ will likely continue its role in overseeing Google, one of the people indicated. Any investigations would focus on whether the companies have used their dominant positions in the AI industry to harm competition through abusive and illegal behavior. The agreement shows enforcers are poised for a broad crackdown on some of the most well-known players in the AI sector, said Sarah Myers West, managing director of the AI Now Institute and a former AI advisor to the FTC. \u201cClearance processes like this are usually a key step before advancing an investigation,\u201d West said. \u201cThis is a clear sign they\u2019re moving quickly here.\u201d Microsoft declined to comment on the DOJ-FTC agreement but, in a statement, defended its partnership with Inflection. \u201cOur agreements with Inflection gave us the opportunity to recruit individuals at Inflection AI and build a team capable of accelerating Microsoft Copilot, while enabling Inflection to continue pursuing its independent business and ambition as an AI studio,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson said, adding that the company is \u201cconfident\u201d it has complied with its reporting obligations. Inflection and Google didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment; Nvidia and OpenAI declined to comment. The DOJ and FTC declined to comment. The FTC-DOJ agreement was earlier reported by The New York Times; the FTC\u2019s Microsoft probe was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal. FTC Chair Lina Khan has warned in op-eds and congressional testimony that, left unchecked, artificial intelligence could \u201cturbocharge\u201d fraud and scams. The agency has published numerous reminders and warnings that businesses can be held liable for making misleading claims about their AI tools or for covertly using consumer data to train AI models. The FTC is currently investigating Reddit\u2019s AI content licensing practices, and is separately investigating OpenAI for possible violations of consumer protection law. The US agencies\u2019 division-of-labor agreement opens the door to more intensive probes of a sector that has energized investors, enthralled consumers and raised alarm bells among critics who say AI urgently needs regulation to forestall widespread job displacement, discrimination and fraud. Specifically, it carves out roles for the FTC and DOJ to review whether tech giants and AI companies are behaving in anticompetitive ways. And it highlights how enforcers are increasingly trying to bring existing laws to bear on the industry as prospects for new US laws governing AI have dimmed. The United States is widely viewed as a laggard on AI regulation as others such as the European Union have leapfrogged it with tough rules about how the technology can be used in high-risk contexts. The EU AI Act, for example, outlaws social scoring systems powered by AI and any biometric-based tools used to guess a person\u2019s race, political leanings or sexual orientation. It also bans the use of AI to interpret the emotions of people in schools and workplaces, as well as some types of automated profiling intended to predict a person\u2019s likelihood of committing future crimes. For years, technology critics and regulators have worried that major tech companies may be monopolizing entire sectors of the economy. That has led to high-profile US government antitrust suits targeting Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft. Some fear that tech companies could abuse their powerful roles in business and society to extend their dominance into the fast-growing field of generative AI, which exploded onto the scene in 2022 when OpenAI released ChatGPT. Nvidia\u2019s soaring stock prices have served as a barometer of the AI frenzy, underscoring the company\u2019s position as a leading supplier of computing chips necessary for training advanced AI models. On Wednesday, Nvidia became the second-largest publicly traded company in the United States, ending the day with a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion and edging out Apple. \u201cAI relies on massive amounts of data and computing power, which can give already-dominant firms a substantial advantage,\u201d DOJ antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter said last week\u00a0in a speech at Stanford University, adding that Americans\u2019 reliance on just a handful of technology giants could allow them to \u201ccontrol these new markets.\u201d One way for tech giants to wield anticompetitive influence in the AI sector, critics\u00a0say, is through exclusive partnerships with AI startups. The agreements can potentially \u201clock in\u201d AI developers as customers of large cloud computing services and give the tech giants significant stakes or influence over the development of AI. Those types of deals, including Microsoft\u2019s relationship with OpenAI, are the subject of an ongoing study by the FTC announced in January. The DOJ has also become increasingly vocal on AI issues. In 2022, the agency\u2019s antitrust division hired Susan Athey, a Stanford University professor and AI expert, to be its chief economist. In looking at competition in the AI industry, antitrust enforcers should take lessons on how technology giants have behaved anticompetitively in the past, Athey told CNN at a recent event in Washington hosted by Bloomberg News. That could include gatekeeping or bottlenecking tactics, making it harder for consumers or customers to switch providers, or becoming the biggest buyer of key supplies \u2014 such as AI chips, for example \u2014 and denying those necessary supplies to competing rivals. \u201cWe should look back to historical analogues and see where sources of market power have been and how people have preserved them, and those are the kinds of tactics we might worry about going forward,\u201d Athey said. That the DOJ is picking up oversight of Nvidia from the FTC is particularly notable, West told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that means criminal penalties are now on the table, because that\u2019s one of the tools DOJ uniquely carries.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context and developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/tech/ftc-microsofts-ai-investigation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_04_media_hunter-biden-trial-right-wing-media", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. America\u2019s judicial system is, apparently, not so rigged, after all. After spending the last three days raging against the courts over\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a034 felony convictions, the right-wing media machine jumped at the opportunity to hype the felony charges being brought against\u00a0Hunter Biden\u00a0in a trial that got underway Monday. Outlets like\u00a0Fox News \u2014\u00a0where figures such as\u00a0Sean Hannity,\u00a0Laura Ingraham,\u00a0Jesse Watters and a parade of others have spent weeks bashing the legal system, even going as far as to portray the unanimous jury verdict to be part of a deep-state conspiracy against the disgraced former president \u2014 were more than happy to place a bright spotlight on the case facing\u00a0President\u00a0Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0son. The cognitive dissonance is remarkable to behold. The same media outlets and figures who have told their audiences that there is a \u201ctwo-tiered justice system\u201d in America, are now prominently covering a trial in which Biden\u2019s own\u00a0Justice Department\u00a0prosecutes his son. If Biden is rigging the justice system, he is doing a lousy job. The trial offers a timely distraction from the uncomfortable reality of Trump\u2019s felony convictions and marks the culmination of years of right-wing attacks and obsession of the president\u2019s son, offering a regular serving of red meat for Fox News\u2019 prime time audience over claims of wrongdoing and innuendo surrounding the purported \u201cBiden Crime Family.\u201d To be clear, the unprecedented nature of a president\u2019s own son going on trial for felony charges warrants significant coverage. However, while Trump\u2019s trial was treated as an illegitimate \u201csham\u201d by the MAGA Media machine, the Hunter Biden trial is being portrayed in a markedly different light. Oddly, the charges brought against President Biden\u2019s son don\u2019t represent \u201celection interference.\u201d Apparently, that\u2019s only a one way street. While there is not a \u201ctwo-tiered justice system\u201d in the country, there certainly is a two-tiered set of standards that outlets like Fox News apply to the Democratic Party versus the Republican Party. Not only are the charges against Hunter Biden being taken very seriously by the same outlets which have spilled untold amounts of ink blasting the courts, but these same outlets are also dishonestly attempting to tie President Biden to the alleged crimes of his son, despite the fact that the GOP has been unable to uncover any evidence establishing such a link. And, suffice to say, it is not like the\u00a0Republican Party\u00a0has not tried. Regardless of what happens in the Hunter Biden trial, however, Trump\u2019s media allies will still undoubtedly claim that the justice system is rigged. If Hunter Biden is acquitted or the jury is hung, the right-wing media machine will use it to further their dishonest narrative that the judicial system is corrupt and only working to target Republicans. But, even if Hunter Biden is found guilty, audiences will be told that he got off easy and should have been hit with more severe charges. It\u2019s a win-win for MAGA Media, because the space is dominated by outlets and figures who are at their core dishonest, choosing to instead peddle certain narratives for profit and power.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/media/hunter-biden-trial-right-wing-media/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens.

Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}

It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_media_columbia-law-review-journal-website", "text": "The website for the Columbia Law Review is no longer accessible following the publication of an article critical of Israel that the publication\u2019s board said did not go through the proper review process. At issue is the publication of an article that said Palestinians are living under a \u201cbrutally sophisticated structure of oppression\u201d by Israel. The board of directors for the Columbia Law Review said in a statement obtained by CNN that the website has been \u201ctemporarily suspended\u201d because the \u201cpiece had not been subject to the usual processes of review or selection for article.\u201d The website has been offline since Monday, with a message that it\u2019s \u201cunder maintenance\u201d when visited as of Wednesday morning. The New York Times was first to report the outage and the board\u2019s statement. The Columbia Law Review Association is an independent nonprofit organization with its own board of directors, and it is not governed by Columbia University or its law school. The board said it asked the student editors on Sunday to open up the review of the article so \u201call student editors would have an opportunity to read the piece, raise any questions or concerns, and otherwise engage.\u201d \u201cWe thought that was necessary in fairness to student editors who had not been part of the group working on the piece and were not previously aware of the piece\u2019s content or even its existence. Whatever your views of this piece, it will clearly be controversial and potentially have an impact on all associated with the Review,\u201d the statement said. The piece was published Monday, despite the board saying it had asked for a delay in publishing until June 7 pending more review. \u201cWe also would like to get the website back up as soon as possible, as having it down is now preventing access to the Review\u2019s scholarship,\u201d it said. The article that sparked the controversy was written by Rabea Eghbariah, a doctoral candidate at Harvard University. He argues that a new legal concept called Nakba is needed to describe more accurately the current condition of Palestinians. It derives from \u201cal-Nakba,\u201d which Palestinians have used to refer to the 1948 establishment of Israel, and means \u201ccatastrophe\u201d in Arabic. \u201cThe attempt to silence my legal scholarship on the Nakba by shutting down the entire Columbia Law Review website is not only reflective of a pervasive and anti-intellectual Palestine exception to academic freedom but is also a testament to a culture of Nakba denialism,\u201d Eghbariah said in a statement to CNN. Roughly 700,000 Palestinians\u00a0fled or were expelled from their homes\u00a0by armed Jewish groups seeking to establish the state of Israel during Al Nakba. More than 15,000 Palestinians\u00a0were also killed\u00a0and 531 towns and villages destroyed during al-Nakba, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, an institute of the Palestinian Authority. \u201cThe intervention by the CLR Board of Directors exposes, once again, that US academic institutions are, in fact, a very hostile environment for Palestinian voices and thought. What is so scary about Palestinians speaking their truth?\u201d It\u2019s the latest flashpoint for Columbia University that has grappled with demonstrations from pro-Palestinian protesters who put up encampments on the school\u2019s grounds protesting Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. On Tuesday, it settled a lawsuit from a Jewish student that said the school failed provide a safe environment.

{"id": "2024_06_06_food_starbucks-grubhub-delivery", "text": "Starbucks is teaming up with Grubhub as it tries to boost sales after a challenging quarter. The coffee chain said on Thursday that most of its beverages and food will be available through the delivery provider starting in June. Today, the partnership is live in Pennsylvania, Colorado and Illinois and other locations. By August, Starbucks items should be available on Grubhub throughout the country, the company said. Prior to the Grubhub partnership, customers could already order Starbucks items via DoorDash and Uber Eats. Delivery has been a bright spot for Starbucks as its sales lag. But partnering with third-party delivery providers like Grubhub can be risky. If the order is late, or something spills on the way over, customers can become frustrated with Starbucks \u2014 even if those things are out of the company\u2019s control. Next time, shoppers might just order from a competitor. In the quarter ending on March 31, sales at US locations open at least 13 months fell 3%, compared to an increase of 12% the year before. Global revenue dipped nearly 2% to $8.56 billion in that period, coming in below analysts\u2019 expectations. Even CEO Laxman Narasimhan called the results \u201cdisappointing.\u201d But delivery grew by double digits. And not only were there more orders than in the same period last year, but people spent more per order. \u201cCustomer demand to get Starbucks delivered continues to increase, as evidenced by double-digit growth in the U.S. delivery business this past quarter,\u201d said Meg Mathes, vice president of digital experiences at Starbucks, in a statement Thursday. Since the pandemic, more consumers have been getting their cafe and restaurant orders to-go, via delivery or pickup. Starbucks said that it has two-cup to-go trays and better shopping bags to protect orders while being delivered. In addition to broadening access to delivery, Starbucks is taking other steps to try to jumpstart sales, like updating its app, offering new menu items and testing staying open overnight.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/food/starbucks-grubhub-delivery/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_business_shoppers-are-hyper-focused-on-value-that-doesnt-mean-only-buying-the-cheapest-option", "text": "American households want the biggest bang for their buck right now when they pull their wallets out to shop. That doesn\u2019t mean they want something cheap all the time. They\u2019ve been paying more for goods and services for a while because of higher inflation that stubbornly stuck around. What\u2019s also occurred concurrently is that higher interest rates have made it more expensive for shoppers to borrow money \u2013 on credit cards for example \u2013 for buying things or paying off necessities such as monthly bills. But even as consumers push through these pressures, they\u2019re still shopping, and seeking deals. Bargain retailers like Walmart and Costco have benefitted, as shown by the retailing industry\u2019s recent slew of first-quarter earnings releases. Discount behemoth\u00a0Walmart\u2019s business was buzzing as thrifty shoppers flocked to its big-box stores last quarter to bag deals on groceries and everyday necessities like shampoo, toothpaste, paper towels and toilet paper. Sales at its stores open at least a year increased 3.8% in the quarter from the same time last year. Other discount purveyors such as Ollie\u2019s Bargain Outlet and Costco also enjoyed a jump in their same-store sales in their latest quarter. At the same time, there\u2019s a different kind of deal-seeking happening, too. Perhaps a bit counterintuitively, a bunch of stores that are known for more expensive products that aren\u2019t exactly necessities are also seeing a boom. Which means that Americans are still spending, but selectively, and that \u201cvalue shopping\u201d means different things to different people. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean cheap. \u201cValue is a watchword for consumers,\u201d said Neil Saunders, retail industry analyst and managing director with GlobalData Retail, in an interview with CNN. \u201cBut value is not just about finding the lowest price. It\u2019s about finding products that people really want and that they will get use out of,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cSo gone are the random impulse buys of things that will be placed at the back of the closet and forgotten, and in are the more considered purchases.\u201d To his point, shoppers are willing to dig deeper if they they feel like they\u2019re getting quality products that are on trend, feel good, and last for a long time, even if it means spending a little bit more. Abercrombie & Fitch enjoyed a stunning 21% surge in its same-store sales last quarter because it hit the fashion trends that its core younger shoppers are craving, such as low-rise baggy jeans and well-tailored wide-legged pants, and then some. The retailer, which also owns the Gen Z-favored Hollister brand, is pushing ahead for the first time into newer lucrative areas such as wedding items like bridal dresses and even pajamas as it strives to become a one-stop destination for its clientele. Williams-Sonoma, which sells pricey kitchenware such as Le Creuset dutch ovens for a few hundred dollars each and $4,000 automatic espresso machines, also reported improving sales in the first quarter. (It also owns upscale home goods and furniture brands Pottery Barn and West Elm.) \u201cOur recent launches with partners, such as LoveShackFancy and Lilly Pulitzer, have driven sales and attracted new customers by tapping into relevant fashion and home decor trends,\u201d Laura Alber, Williams-Sonoma CEO, told analysts during the company\u2019s most recent earnings call. Gap Inc., whose brands include Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta, pulled out same-store sales increases for the first time in years in its most recent quarter across all four brands under new CEO Richard Dickson, who came on board last August. Dickson\u2019s focus has been on getting back to the basics with quality products. This strategy included its newest summer linen clothing collection and surprise marketing moves involving celebrity collaborations. A Gap white shirt dress for Anne Hathaway appeared to thrill shoppers. The dress became a viral moment on social media for the retailer, which Gap quickly seized upon by releasing a limited pre-order for the dress to its shoppers priced at $158. It sold out in under three hours. Shoppers are homing in not just on prices but on the benefits that they hope to receive from products for the price that they\u2019re paying for it, Zak Stambor, senior analyst, retail and ecommerce, with market research firm eMarketer told CNN.   \u201cConsumers are thinking long and hard about where and when they are spending,\u201d Stambor said. \u201cA sizable segment of them are focused on value, however, that doesn\u2019t directly correlate to a low price. Shoppers are willing to spend if they see value in an on-trend, well-made dress from Abercrombie \u2013 or a healthy salad from Sweetgreen.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/business/shoppers-are-hyper-focused-on-value-that-doesnt-mean-only-buying-the-cheapest-option/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}

The company said on Wednesday that the program will be aimed at rewarding employees who stay with the company long-term, with employees able to earn up to a maximum of $1,000 for those who have been with the company 20 years or more. The company said any hourly store employee who has been with the company for a year or more is eligible for the bonus program, with those full-time employees with at least a year but less than five years getting an annual bonus of $350. The amount of the bonus then increases from there with seniority. Walmart has an outsized impact on the labor market for hourly workers, and has been grappling with finding and retaining the workers it needs in a tight labor market. It said it has raised hourly wages by around 30% over the last five years and that its average US hourly wage now is close to $18. Its starting pay ranges from $14 to $19 depending on the store and local market. A $1,000 bonus comes to just under 50 cents an hour for employees working a 40-hour week and equal to about 3% of annual pay for those full-time workers making that average hourly pay. The company has 1.6 million US employees, of which nearly 1.5 million are hourly workers. It said this new program covers about 700,000 of those hourly employees who work in stores. Store managers and supervisors already qualified for a bonus program, which is paid out in March after the close of the company\u2019s fiscal year at the end of January. Walmart boosted the average pay of its store managers from $117,000 to $128,000, or by just over 9%, the retailer announced earlier this year. \u2013 CNN\u2019s Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/business/walmart-hourly-worker-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_media_washington-post-will-lewis-npr", "text": "William Lewis, the new publisher and chief executive of The Washington Post, reportedly tried to kill\u00a0a\u00a0story\u00a0about his alleged involvement in a UK phone hacking scandal coverup, offering an NPR reporter an interview in exchange for squashing the\u00a0forthcoming article. The decade-old UK scandal that engulfed right-wing media mogul Rupert Murdoch\u2019s \u201cNews of the World\u201d tabloid, was revived in recent years in a\u00a0new lawsuit filed\u00a0by Prince Harry and other notable figures including Guy Ritchie and Hugh Grant. At the time, Lewis was a senior executive at Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation. He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. On Thursday, veteran NPR media reporter David Folkenflik\u00a0reported\u00a0that in December, Lewis, who had just been named publisher and chief executive of the Post, offered him an exclusive interview in exchange for his willingness not to publish a story on Lewis\u2019 potential involvement in the scandal. \u201cIn several conversations, Lewis repeatedly \u2014 and heatedly \u2014offered to give me an exclusive interview about the\u00a0Post\u2019s future, as long as I dropped the story about the allegations,\u201d Folkenflik reported. \u201cAt that time, the same spokesperson, who works directly for Lewis from the U.K. and has advised him since his days at the\u00a0Wall Street Journal \u2014\u00a0confirmed to me that an explicit offer was on the table: drop the story, get the interview.\u201d The Washington Post did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. Despite Lewis\u2019 attempt to squash the story, NPR\u00a0published the article\u00a0in late December under the headline \u201cNew \u2018Washington Post\u2019 CEO accused of Murdoch tabloid hacking cover-up,\u201d featuring a 2011 photo of Lewis with Murdoch. The revelation came a day after The New York Times reported that Lewis had\u00a0clashed in recent weeks\u00a0with former Post executive editor Sally Buzbee over a decision to publish an article in May about the hacking scandal that named Lewis. According to the Times, Lewis told Buzbee the story didn\u2019t warrant coverage in the newspaper. \u201cWhen Ms. Buzbee said The Post would publish an article anyway, he said her decision represented a lapse in judgment and abruptly ended the conversation,\u201d\u00a0the Times reported. A person with knowledge of Buzbee\u2019s account confirmed the conversation to CNN, adding that the then-executive editor felt pressured by Lewis over the story. Days later, when the judge in the UK case allowed allegations about Lewis to be included in the lawsuit, the Post\u00a0published another story\u00a0naming him. On Sunday night, the Post\u00a0abruptly announced\u00a0Buzbee was departing the newspaper and was being immediately replaced by former Wall Street Journal editor Matt Murray in a seismic shakeup at the outlet. \u201cSally is an incredible leader and a supremely talented media executive who will be sorely missed,\u201d Lewis said in\u00a0a statement.\u00a0\u201cI wish her all the best going forward.\u201d Notably, Buzbee did not offer a farewell note to staff. Staffers at the Post who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity said that newsroom morale had plummeted in the wake Buzbee\u2019s departure and published reports about Lewis. The news comes two weeks after Lewis\u00a0unveiled a new plan\u00a0to turn around the beleaguered newspaper, telling staff the company had lost $77 million over the last year and seen a dramatic 50% plunge in audience traffic since 2020. \u201cTo speak candidly,\u201d Lewis told staffers, \u201cwe are in a hole, and we have been for some time.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/media/washington-post-will-lewis-npr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_media_pat-mcafee-caitlin-clark-backlash", "text": "ESPN host Pat McAfee has apologized for calling Caitlin Clark a \u201cWhite b*tch\u201d during a Monday show segment over whether race has played a factor in the WNBA rookie\u2019s meteoric rise. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have used \u2018white b*itch\u2019 as a descriptor of Caitlin Clark. No matter the context.. even if we\u2019re talking about race being a reason for some of the stuff happening. I have way too much respect for her and women to put that into the universe,\u201d McAfee\u00a0wrote Monday afternoon on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cMy intentions when saying it were complimentary just like the entire segment but, a lot of folks are saying that it certainly wasn\u2019t at all,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s 100% on me and for that I apologize.\u201d McAfee wrote that he had sent an apology to Clark, as well. The apology came hours after McAfee argued on his program, which airs on both ESPN and YouTube, that it is Clark and Clark alone who is behind the WNBA\u2019s surge in popularity this year, contending that some have argued that it\u2019s because she\u2019s a White player that she\u2019s become so popular. McAfee, the former NFL punter turned shock jock, argued that is not the case, outlining Clark\u2019s dominant television ratings, ticket sales and jersey sales in a game show-style segment he called, \u201cGuess Which WNBA Rookie.\u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to say is, what the WNBA currently has is what we like to describe as a cash cow. There is a superstar,\u201d McAfee had said. \u201cBut I would like the media people that continue to say, \u2018This rookie class, this rookie class.\u2019 Nah, just call it for what it is. There is one White b*tch for the Indiana team who is a superstar.\u201d McAfee went on to describe how Clark \u201ccarried\u201d Iowa\u2019s basketball program and shattered NCAA scoring records. \u201cIs there a chance people just enjoy watching her play basketball because of how electrifying she is, what she did what she stood for, how she went about going what she went for?\u201d McAfee said. \u201cMaybe. But instead we have to hear people say we only like her because she\u2019s White, and she\u2019s only popular because the rest of the rookie class is doing what they\u2019re doing. Well, that\u2019s a bunch of bulls**t and we think the WNBA \u2014 more specifically their refs \u2014 need to stop trying to screw her over at every single turn. What you have is somebody special and we\u2019re lucky she\u2019s here in Indiana.\u201d While McAfee\u2019s praise of Clark was effusive, his use of the pejorative term \u201cWhite b*tch\u201d and focus on the race of the players drew backlash, including from some ESPN staffers. \u201cThis is just completely unacceptable,\u201d ESPN analyst Kim Adams\u00a0wrote on X. \u201cInterested to see how ESPN handles it. And his entire argument is not conducive to anything going on in the WNBA right now. Just let the women hoop.\u201d \u201cThe men are not ok,\u201d ESPN WNBA reporter Alexa Philippou\u00a0wrote on X,\u00a0shortly after the segment aired. \u201cBeyond unacceptable,\u201d\u00a0wrote\u00a0The Athletic reporter and NBC sports analyst Nicole Auerbach. \u201cReferring to Caitlin Clark as \u2018the white b*tch for Indiana.\u2019 That\u2019s beyond being too comfortable. Just totally unacceptable,\u201d former ESPN host Jemele Hill\u00a0wrote on X. ESPN declined to comment to CNN on the matter. The Indiana Fever did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The backlash wasn\u2019t the first time McAfee has caused headaches for ESPN. Earlier this year, McAfee ignited a torrent of outrage when he allowed the conspiracy-curious New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers to baselessly suggest during his show that ABC late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel might be named in documents identifying Jeffrey Epstein associates. McAfee later apologized after Kimmel threatened to take legal action and declared Rodgers would no longer appear on the show for the rest of the season. McAfee also went after former ESPN executive Norby Williamson, accusing the network veteran of \u201csabotage\u201d and calling him a \u201crat,\u201d alleging he leaked false information about McAfee\u2019s show. Just a few months after those attacks, Williamson departed the network. Clark, meanwhile, was named the WNBA Rookie of the Month for May.

{"id": "2024_06_06_economy_may-jobs-report-preview", "text": "The US job market showed a softer side in April when just 175,000 jobs were added, marking one of the weakest months in the past three years. It was also well shy of economists\u2019 expectations (for 235,000 jobs added) and sharply lower than the 315,000 net gain for March. It\u2019s all relative, though. The 175,000 is in line with what was seen pre-pandemic and the neutral rate of job growth to keep pace with population gains. Based on initial estimates, May\u2019s jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, due out Friday at 8:30 am ET, could be similar: Economists are expecting job growth of 180,000 payrolls and an unemployment rate that holds tight at 3.9%. If the jobless rate stays below 4%, it would extend a streak not seen since the early 1950s. In its battle to bring down inflation, the Federal Reserve has wanted to see demand cool off so as to take the heat off price hikes and for the labor market to ease into a \u201cbetter balance\u201d of the supply and demand of workers \u2014 all without causing a spike in joblessness or triggering a recession. \u201cThe labor market is still strong and solid; but at the same time, it is moving toward that \u2018soft landing\u2019 scenario, a narrative that we\u2019ve been talking about for so long,\u201d Elizabeth Crofoot, senior economist at labor data analytics firm Lightcast, told CNN, referencing the process of reining in inflation without sending the economy into recession. \u201cThis is it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is [the soft landing].\u201d The slew of complementary employment data released in advance of Friday\u2019s report seems to be teeing up just that: Job openings are shrinking, hiring is slowing, people aren\u2019t quitting as much; however, layoff activity remains muted. \u201cI think all of these measures are pretty much in line with things are cooling but in a very gradual descent,\u201d said Crofoot, who formerly served as an economist for the BLS. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the labor market to crash and burn, we want it to do what it\u2019s doing, which is a gradual softening.\u201d A report for the record books The May jobs report could cement a trend that the US hasn\u2019t seen since the early 1950s: If the jobless rate comes in as expected, it would mark the 28th consecutive month of sub-4% unemployment, which would be the longest streak in more than 70 years. \u201cIf unemployment stays below 4% for the 28th consecutive month, it will be cause for celebration,\u201d economist Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, wrote in a note on Tuesday. \u201cIf the other data in the\u00a0jobs\u00a0report looks like they did in April, then it should help the Fed feel more comfortable about lowering interest rates.\u201d If the unemployment rate were to come in at or above 4% \u2014 something that\u2019s not expected, given broader labor data but also not impossible, because the data that feeds into the monthly measurement is volatile \u2014 it could have a psychological effect, said Julia Pollak, chief economist with online job site ZipRecruiter. \u201c4% is thought of as a magical number \u2014 a number below which participation rises, below which we tend to see employment rates increase faster for women and for minorities,\u201d she said. \u201cEmployers in a tight labor market, they have to do extraordinary things; they have to cast a wider net; they have to actively recruit non-traditional candidates; they have to offer more attractive job conditions, more flexibility, think about installing air conditioning in their trucks or offering a bus to employees. So, it is kind of a magical number.\u201d First-time claims for unemployment benefits are still hovering well below pre-pandemic norms. On Thursday, the Department of Labor reported that Americans filed 229,000 initial claims for unemployment insurance during the week ended June 1. Although it\u2019s the highest weekly total in a month, last week\u2019s tally is below the average of 311,000 filings seen during the decade before the pandemic. A separate report released Thursday showed that fewer job cuts were announced in May than both the month and year before. US-based employers announced 63,816 job cuts last month, down 1.5% from April and 20% below May 2023, according to a Challenger, Gray & Christmas report released Thursday. \u201cJob cuts remained flat in May as companies assess performance and make plans for [the third and fourth quarter],\u201d Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of the outplacement and business research firm, said in a statement. However, Challenger also cautioned that the slowdown in activity could be an indication of not merely softness but of weakening. \u201cMeanwhile, hiring announcements are at their lowest levels in a decade,\u201d he said. \u201cThe typical churn in a healthy labor market appears to be stalling.\u201d Beyond the payrolls and unemployment rate Although the initial consensus is for the job gains to remain stable but solid, economists are keeping close watch on a few key trends within the report: Average hourly earnings: The Fed has been closely watching wage growth out of concern that faster-than-typical pay gains may put upward pressure on inflation. Wage gains have slowed, but remain above pre-pandemic levels. Economists are expecting for average hourly earnings to hold steady at an annual growth rate of 3.9%, which is about 0.9 percentage points higher than in February 2020, BLS data shows. Foreign-born workers: In addition to high labor force participation rates among prime working age individuals, specifically prime working-age women, the US labor market is benefiting\u00a0from a boom in immigrant workers. The number of employed foreign-born workers set a record high of 31.1 million people in March and dipped to 30.5 million in April. State and local public education: The Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief program expires in September, and schools are bracing for potentially negative outcomes, including widespread layoffs. Some of these workforce moves typically come at the end of the school year, meaning the May jobs report and June report could show the effects. \u201cThere\u2019s just uncertainty around the magnitude and the timing,\u201d said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist for Oxford Economics. Share of unemployment due to quits: In 2019, the share of unemployment due to voluntary quits averaged 13.6%; and in April 2024, it measured 12%, CEPR\u2019s Dean Baker noted earlier this week. \u201cOne anomaly in recent job reports has been the relatively small share of unemployment due to voluntary quits,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is a measure of people\u2019s confidence in the labor market, since it indicates that they are willing to leave a job before they have a new one lined up.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/economy/may-jobs-report-preview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_economy_india-election-economy-challenges-women-intl-hnk", "text": "India, the world\u2019s fastest growing major economy, is not firing on all cylinders. That\u2019s a problem for Narendra Modi, who has just won a third consecutive five-year term as prime minister, although without a simple majority. The 73-year-old wants to make the country a $5 trillion economy before the end of the current decade. His plans for reform have been complicated by the narrower-than-expected election victory, and there are major challenges ahead. One entrenched problem standing in the way of India\u2019s superpower ambitions is the lack of jobs for hundreds of millions of citizens, particularly women. There are over 460 million women of working age in India \u2014 more than the entire population of the European Union \u2014 and they are more educated, aspirational and healthier than any previous generation. But their dreams are clashing against a harsh reality. Take Gunasri Tamilselvan, 22, who fears having to quit the job that she loves. The engineering graduate started working at Finnish electronics manufacturer Salcomp\u2019s factory in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu last year. Tamilselvan is part of a sought-after team making mobile chargers for major smartphone brands, but she has had to fight both at home and at work for her right to be financially independent. And now, she is running out of time. Her family wants to arrange a marriage for her as soon as possible. In South Asia, it is still a norm for parents find\u00a0spouses for their children. \u201cMy father has not been very comfortable with my work,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cHe has given me 10 months, after which he will choose a husband for me and get me married.\u201d If that happens, she would then have to negotiate with her husband and in-laws to continue working. It\u2019s not the only battle she wants to win. At the factory, she says she often works much harder to prove to her male colleagues that she deserves her place in the automation department, which involves dealing with the latest machinery. Only about one-third of India\u2019s working age women are active in the labor force, according to the World Bank, much lower than the global average of around 50%. As a result, the country is missing out on billions of dollars. The\u00a0World Bank\u00a0said in 2018 that India could boost its rate of economic growth to 9% per year if around 50% of women were in the work force. (The economy grew by 8.2% in the fiscal year that ended in March.) During Modi\u2019s 10 years in power, India has jumped four spots to become the world\u2019s fifth largest economy, and analysts are confident that his government can turn the country into an economic superpower, behind only the United States and China by 2027. This historic opportunity for India comes at a time when China is struggling with an unprecedented economic slump, and the world is looking for a new growth engine. Western manufacturers are also keen to diversify their supply chains. But there are also fears that India might miss out. According to McKinsey, the contribution of women to India\u2019s GDP is only 18%, one of the lowest proportions in the world. This is in stark contrast with China, where for several decades, women have been powerful players in the economic boom. Job creation, particularly for women, is \u201cliterally an unspoken emergency\u201d in the country, said Chandrasekhar Sripada, a professor at the\u00a0Indian\u00a0School of Business, adding that \u201cthe problem is so humongous that there are no magic solutions and silver bullets.\u201d \u2018Half the sky\u2019 From restrictive cultural norms to office harassment, there are many reasons why women, even when highly skilled, choose to stay at home. \u201cIndian women spend about seven to eight hours a day minimum in unpaid work,\u201d as most domestic and childcare duties still fall on them, said Sripada. Like India, women in China were also relegated to subordinate roles for centuries. Foot binding, which improved a woman\u2019s marriage prospects, was perhaps the most extreme practice that limited her ability to work. But this changed drastically after the Communist Party took over the country in 1949, with Chairman Mao Zedong banning feudal marriage and advocating gender equality. \u201cWomen hold up half the sky,\u201d Mao had declared famously. Today, they contribute over 40% to the world\u2019s second largest economy, according to McKinsey. Over the last decade, the Modi government has introduced policies\u00a0to encourage more women to join the workforce. Since 2017, the country has mandated\u00a026 weeks of paid\u00a0maternity leave, which is more than China\u2019s 98 days. The new government is expected to try to capitalize on the massive rethink underway among companies on supply chains. International firms want to diversify their operations away from China, where they are threatened by rising tension between Beijing and Washington. As a result, some of the world\u2019s biggest firms, including major Apple (AAPL) suppliers such as Foxconn, are expanding their operations significantly in India, and many of them are hiring women in large numbers, government officials in Tamil Nadu told CNN. According to market research firm\u00a0Canalys, up to 23% of iPhones will be made in India by the end of 2025, up from 6% in 2022. Factory jobs Much of this change is visible in Tamil Nadu, India\u2019s industrial powerhouse where companies such as Foxconn and Samsung have manufacturing plants. Over 40% of India\u2019s\u00a0female factory employees work in the southern state, said Vishnu Venugopalan, chief executive of Guidance Tamil Nadu, the state\u2019s investment promotion agency. India\u2019s most valuable conglomerate, the 156-year-old salt-to-software Tata Group, is also trying to improve diversity at its various manufacturing plants across India. One of its units, Tata Power, has built a new solar cell and module factory where 80% of the workers are women. Deepesh Nanda, the president of renewables at Tata Power, told CNN that while it can be difficult at times to improve diversity in an \u201cexisting setup,\u201d having a \u201cclean slate\u201d helped the company set a benchmark. The facility, located in Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu, is hiring workers largely from the local community, to make it easier for the many Indian women who still prefer to live with their parents or spouses to apply. To get these women to enter and stay in the workforce, the company is offering benefits ranging from affordable housing to cabs with security guards. Such benefits are crucial as India is considered to be one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a women because of the high risk of sexual violence and slave labor. Parameshwari J, a chemistry graduate who is a trainee at the Tata plant, said she would have thought twice about taking the position if she had to relocate to a new city, because of concerns ranging from safety to language barriers. Like many of her peers, the 26-year-old, who recently got married, had to seek her family\u2019s approval to work. \u201cWhen I decided to get married, I told my in-laws that I will work and I need to be independent,\u201d she told\u00a0CNN. A different path The Tamil Nadu government is building vast housing projects for women workers to provide safe and hygienic accommodation and support the state\u2019s burgeoning smartphone manufacturing ecosystem. Two of those projects, accommodating over 36,000 women, will be occupied by Foxconn workers, while another with a capacity of 11,000 will be taken by a Tata Group company, said Arun Roy, the state\u2019s industries secretary. In China, migrant workers often live in sprawling dormitories provided by companies, and such arrangements have been instrumental in making the country the world\u2019s factory. Foxconn\u2019s facility in Zhengzhou in central China, the world\u2019s largest iPhone factory, normally houses some 200,000 workers. India may not be able to set up such gigantic facilities. \u201cIt is difficult to replicate the Chinese model fully as their scale is massive,\u201d said Roy. \u201cThat kind of land acquisition is not easy in India.\u201d The dormitory culture may not take off in a big way for other reasons too. \u201cMigration is painful,\u201d said Sripada. \u201cWe should plan for less migration. We should plan for more decentralized economy.\u201d Tamil Nadu says it has done exactly that, which is part of the reason why it has so many women in its workforce. \u201cThe manufacturing clusters in the state are not just in large cities,\u201d said Venugopalan. \u201cThere\u2019s a fair amount of distribution regionally, which means you don\u2019t need to look at large scale migration of people into one single growth center.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/economy/india-election-economy-challenges-women-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}

In May, Israel banned the\u00a0Qatari-based\u00a0news network from operating in the country for 45 days under a\u00a0sweeping\u00a0new wartime law that allows the Israeli government to ban\u00a0foreign\u00a0media organizations it deems \u201charmful\u201d to the\u00a0nation\u2019s\u00a0security.\u00a0Al Jazeera\u00a0condemned the move\u00a0as a \u201cdark day for democracy\u201d that sets a concerning precedent for other international media outlets operating in Israel. While the ban is not permanent and only valid during the declared period of war, the Israeli government can continue to\u00a0extend the closure for additional 45-day\u00a0periods. On Tuesday, a Tel Aviv District Court ruled that the ban on Al Jazeera could stand but was to be shortened to 35 days, meaning it will expire on Sunday. Al Jazeera said it was notified by the Israeli Ministry of Communications\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0that it intends to request that the government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approve another 45-day ban. Israel has claimed that Al Jazeera \u201charms Israeli security,\u201d and has a \u201cclose connection\u201d with Hamas, the militant group it is waging war against in Gaza. \u201cAl Jazeera reporters harmed Israel\u2019s security and incited against IDF soldiers. It is time to expel the mouthpiece of Hamas from our country,\u201d Netanyahu\u00a0said\u00a0last month. According to Reuters, a Tel Aviv District Court\u00a0judge\u00a0said Tuesday he had been presented evidence of the government\u2019s claims, but\u00a0the\u00a0evidence was not made public. Walid Omary, Al Jazeera\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief,\u00a0told CNN he had \u201ccynicism, sarcasm and contempt for the court\u2019s decision, and we reject all accusations and excuses.\u201d Last month, Israeli authorities raided\u00a0Al Jazeera offices in Jerusalem, seizing its\u00a0broadcast equipment\u00a0and\u00a0shutting down its operations.\u00a0The network\u2019s\u00a0channels were\u00a0removed from\u00a0Israeli cable and satellite providers and its website was\u00a0blocked\u00a0from within Israel. Weeks later, Israeli authorities also\u00a0seized equipment\u00a0from the Associated Press\u00a0that was used to broadcast the Gaza skyline, claiming the broadcast was\u00a0being provided to\u00a0Al Jazeera and endangered Israeli troops.\u00a0The move\u00a0sparked\u00a0swift condemnation, including from\u00a0press groups,\u00a0Israeli opposition leaders and the US government. Hours after the seizure, Israeli authorities returned AP\u2019s equipment and the\u00a0live\u00a0shot was back on air. Al Jazeera, one of the only networks to have a live, consistent presence from within the blockaded Gaza strip, has denied Israel\u2019s claims\u00a0that it is a threat to the country\u2019s security, calling the allegations \u201cdangerous and ridiculous.\u201d At least six of its staff members have been killed in Gaza since the war began. Earlier this week, the Israeli Supreme Court also heard arguments brought against the law by an Israeli civil rights association, which said among other arguments, that the law infringes on the right to freedom of expression, information and press in Israel. During the hearing, Justice Yitzhak Amit, the head of the panel of judges, said that \u201cthere is no doubt that there is a violation of freedom of expression here,\u201d\u00a0according to\u00a0the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.

{"id": "2024_06_06_business_congestion-pricing-new-york-hochul", "text": "New York was just a few weeks away from becoming the first American city to adopt congestion pricing, a system designed to alleviate traffic, reduce air pollution and fund public transit. Then, at the last minute, the governor lost her nerve, citing the dubious claim that it would hurt the\u00a0working class. See here: Gov. Kathy Hochul\u00a0abruptly shelved\u00a0New York\u2019s congestion pricing program on Wednesday, saying she\u2019s had a change of heart over the economics of it all, citing the risk of \u201ctoo many unintended consequences.\u201d Yes, a $15 toll might deter some folks from driving into Midtown to spend money on Broadway shows and dinner. But you know what else is a deterrent? Bumper to bumper traffic and choking pollution. Many of the businesses that employ the workers Hochul claims to be protecting are disappointed with the decision. \u201cThe toll revenues would amount to only $1 billion a year, which is far less than the $20+ billion cost of lost productivity, overtime and fuel expenses, environmental and health costs that are the result of excess traffic congestion,\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, president and CEO of the\u00a0Partnership for New York City, a nonprofit that represents hundreds of local businesses. The plan, now on hold indefinitely, was one of those obviously-good-for-New-Yorkers policies that would come at the cost of mildly inconveniencing drivers who live in the suburbs and who believe that bringing a car onto an island barely wider than their living room is some kind of fundamental human right. Put simply:\u00a0Drivers would have to pony up $15 to enter Manhattan\u2019s most congested areas, below 60th Street, during peak hours. The price was supposed to be high enough to discourage drivers, but not so high that businesses would suffer. (Similar programs have been\u00a0successful, despite some avoidable pitfalls,\u00a0in Singapore, London and Stockholm.) The $1 billion in annual revenue from the tolls would help fund critical and long overdue improvements to the city\u2019s bus and subway systems, which run 24/7 and move more than 4.5 million people around the city every day. And, as any regular New York commuter knows all too well,\u00a0any\u00a0improvement to that experience would be, like, really nice. Maybe \u2014 and I\u2019m just spitballing here \u2014 we could use that money to replace whatever 1950s duct tape is currently being used to keep the signaling systems together? Anyway, Hochul\u2019s stated opposition was about the economic recovery post-pandemic. \u201cLet\u2019s be real: a $15 charge may not mean a lot to someone who has the means, but it can break the budget of a working- or middle-class household,\u201d she said. (Which is true, but those generally aren\u2019t the people driving into\u00a0Midtown at 3pm on a Tuesday.) Hochul continued: \u201cIt puts the squeeze on the very people who make this city go: the teachers, first responders, small business workers, bodega owners,\u201d she said. (And again, it is important to note that those people take\u00a0public transit\u00a0to work, and that emergency vehicles are exempt from the fee.) Transportation Alternatives, one of the advocacy groups that supported congestion pricing, said Hochul\u2019s delay was \u201ca slap in the face to the millions of New Yorkers \u2026 The next time your train is late, your bus is trapped in traffic, your subway station is still missing an elevator, you know who to blame: Governor Kathy Hochul.\u201d Bottom line:\u00a0This was almost certainly a political calculation more than an economic one.\u00a0As the New York Times notes, congestion pricing has been wildly unpopular \u201cin suburban areas of the Hudson Valley and Long Island where Democrats are desperate to make gains\u201d in this election cycle.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/06/business/congestion-pricing-new-york-hochul/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_06_economy_ecb-europe-interest-rate-cut", "text": "The European Central Bank cut interest rates Thursday, moving before the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England to lower borrowing costs as inflation recedes following years of rate hikes. The first ECB rate cut in nearly five years takes the benchmark rate in the 20 countries that use the euro down to 3.75% from an all-time high of 4%, where it had stood since September. The move will bring some relief to companies and consumers, many of whom have felt the financial strain of the rapid run-up in interest rates since late 2021. But the ECB cautioned that the fight to control price rises wasn\u2019t completely over yet and that it wasn\u2019t yet committed to further rate cuts. \u201cDespite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year,\u201d the central bank said in a statement. Speaking to journalists, ECB President Christine Lagarde \u2014 who donned a necklace in the shape of the words \u201cIn charge\u201d \u2014 emphasized that the central bank would continue to follow \u201ca data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach.\u201d \u201cWe are not precommitting to a particular rate path,\u201d she said. Major central banks started raising borrowing costs as inflation soared, driven higher by the end of the pandemic and the energy shock caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Price rises in the eurozone, the United States and the United Kingdom have since slowed, bringing the annual\u00a0inflation rate down from its peak between 9% and 11% toward the 2% targeted by the respective central banks. The ECB\u2019s decision follows a rate cut by the\u00a0Bank of Canada\u00a0Wednesday, which became the first G7 central bank to reduce borrowing costs in the past few years. Central banks in\u00a0Switzerland\u00a0and Sweden have also cut interest rates this year. Traders are all but certain the Fed will keep rates on hold at its meeting next week, and again in July. The Bank of England is likewise not expected to cut rates at its meeting on June 20, which comes just weeks before the UK holds a general election. Ahead of the Fed, but not in a hurry Although the ECB has fired the starting gun on rate cuts, analysts think it could stand still at its next meeting in July. \u201cThis is not a central bank in a rush to ease policy,\u201d said Mark Wall, chief European economist at Deutsche Bank, describing the ECB\u2019s tone as \u201chawkish\u201d despite Thursday\u2019s cut. Eurozone\u00a0inflation ticked up\u00a0more than expected in May, to 2.6% from 2.4% the previous month. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, also accelerated as wages grew rapidly. On Thursday, the ECB raised its inflation forecast for this year, to 2.5% from the 2.3% predicted in March. It added that it would keep interest rates \u201csufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary\u201d to return inflation to the 2% target. The European economy, which only\u00a0narrowly avoided a recession\u00a0last year, is showing signs of recovery, which could prop up inflation. In May, combined output in manufacturing and services hit a 12-month high, according to a\u00a0survey\u00a0of purchasing managers compiled by S&P Global and Hamburg Commercial Bank. Business confidence, meanwhile, reached\u00a0its strongest level in more than two years and unemployment is at a record low. The ECB upgraded its forecast for this year\u2019s economic growth in the eurozone to 0.9% from the 0.6% projected in March. Another factor that could influence the central bank\u2019s thinking going forward is the timing of rate cuts by the Fed, which are expected later this year. Policymakers in Frankfurt may be hesitant to move too far ahead of their US counterparts as that could cause the euro to lose value against the dollar, which could then push up inflation in Europe by raising the price of imports. Higher interest rates tend to attract more international capital flows into a country, boosting demand for its currency. This article has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_06_04_cars_japan-toyota-raid-safety-scandal-hnk-intl", "text": "Japanese officials descended on the headquarters of Toyota on Tuesday, after a safety test scandal at a number of automakers in the country widened this week. The inspections at Toyota\u2019s offices in central Japan would continue over the next few days, Japan\u2019s Ministry of Transport told CNN. It comes as the world\u2019s biggest carmaker by sales grapples with growing concerns over the certification of some of its vehicles. The ministry said five automakers \u2014 Toyota (TM), Mazda, Honda (HMC), Suzuki and Yamaha \u2014 had submitted incorrect or manipulated safety test data when they applied for certification of the vehicles. Toyota,\u00a0Mazda and Yamaha were ordered to suspend shipments of some vehicle models, including the Corolla Fielder and Corolla Axio. All five companies were told to review their safety certification processes. A probe already undertaken by Toyota had revealed that at least seven of its models, some of them discontinued, were tested using methods that differed from government standards, the company said Monday in a statement. Toyota was looking into \u201cinadequate data in pedestrian and occupant protection tests\u201d and \u201cerrors in crash tests,\u201d it said. The investigation is ongoing. Toyota said it had not violated safety regulations and customers did not need to stop using their cars. Koji Endo of\u00a0SBI Securities said that Japan\u2019s certification tests are very stringent and much stricter than in other countries. \u201cAs for these safety inspection standards, this rule was created in 1951, so it\u2019s quite outdated and hard to follow for many automakers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to remember, Toyota has conducted hundreds of thousands, if not millions of tests throughout the past 15 years. And of those tests, there were only concerns about how three or four of those tests were conducted. That\u2019s very little,\u201d Endo added. Still, because of its position as the world\u2019s top carmaker, the scandal had become \u201ca big problem\u201d for the company, he said. In a press conference Monday, Akio Toyoda, the grandson of Toyota\u2019s founder and company chairman, apologized for the problems. \u201cI intend to extend our efforts throughout the entire group and restore authority on site to create a solid corporate culture that makes ever-better cars,\u201d he said. Operations at Toyota\u2019s factories will not be halted during the probe but production will pause for the three models under investigation, the Transport Ministry said. It said officials would also inspect the facilities of the other four carmakers but did not say when those visits would take place. In January, Toyota\u00a0announced\u00a0it would suspend shipments of certain models after finding irregularities in certification tests for diesel engines developed by its affiliate, Toyota Industries. The revelations came just a month after Daihatsu, the Japanese small carmaker owned by Toyota,\u00a0halted domestic production\u00a0after admitting it had forged the results of safety tests for more than 30 years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/cars/japan-toyota-raid-safety-scandal-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/07/2024", "section": "business"}}
