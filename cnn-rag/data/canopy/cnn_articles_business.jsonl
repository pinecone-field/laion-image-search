{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_investing_premarket-stocks-trading", "text": "Traders could be forgiven for breaking out their champagne glasses, even though 2024 isn\u2019t halfway done yet. US stocks have leaped from all-time high to all-time high this year: the S&P 500 has surpassed its own record a staggering 31 times since January. That equates to a new all-time high about every four trading days. Investors have shrugged off elevated interest and inflation rates, a chaotic political and global environment and general economic uncertainty to give markets the best start to an election year on record. What\u2019s happening: Presidential election years are typically good for stocks. The S&P 500 alone has generated an average return of 7% during presidential election years since 1952, according to LPL Financial. If you limit that to election years in which the incumbent president is running for reelection, the average jumps to 12.2%. This year, the index has already far surpassed those average gains. The S&P 500 is 14.6% higher year-to-date \u2014 the best start to an election year on record, according to Goldman Sachs \u2014 and up nearly 31% from its October 2023 low at 4,117 points. So why is this election cycle different from all the others that have gone before? Gains are typically higher when incumbent presidents run for reelection, most likely because investors crave stability. And this election is the first since 1892 that the nominees of both major parties have occupied the White House, notes Ed Clissold, chief US strategist at Ned Davis Research. If one incumbent running for office reduces uncertainty, then two incumbents really reduces uncertainty. That could pull the typical year-end election relief rally forward, said Clissold. A reason to celebrate: Not only are stocks up, they\u2019re rarely going down. It\u2019s been 333 days since the S&P 500 recorded a decline of 2% or greater, which is the longest stretch since February 2018, wrote Goldman Sachs\u2019 Scott Rubner in a recent note to clients. His outlook for the latter half of the year remains positive \u2014 a good first half means a \u201cvery good\u201d second half, he wrote. \u201cThe impressive market rally continues, notable not only for its strength but also for its stability,\u201d wrote Nationwide\u2019s chief of investment research, Mark Hackett, in a note Friday. \u201c[T]here is no reason that the steady march higher can\u2019t persist, particularly as we approach the tailwind from election seasonality.\u201d Last week\u2019s rally was broad, assuaging some concerns from investors that recent gains have been concentrated in a few big names like tech darling Nvidia, which is up more than 155% so far this year. The equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 rose 1.12% and the small cap Russell 2000 gained 0.79% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was flat on the week. The sustained gains are causing some analysts to raise their year-end targets for the S&P 500.  Scott Chronert, research head of US equity strategy at Citigroup, raised his year-end target to 5,600 from 5,100 last week. Analysts at Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and UBS have also revised their expectations for the broad-based index higher. Yes, but: Market volatility in an election year tends to pick up in October and there are many months left in this cycle with potential surprises to come. Thursday brings CNN\u2019s televised debate between President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump. \u201cThere is plenty of scope for big headlines and for the candidates to gather some momentum or see it go into reverse,\u201d wrote Deutsche Bank\u2019s Jim Reid. There\u2019s also the prospect that investors get complacent and begin to take the current bull market for granted. \u201cThe longer optimism remains high, the bigger the risk that it turns into complacency and leaves the market vulnerable to the next piece of negative news,\u201d said Clissold with Ned Davis Research. \u201cAn autumn pullback fits well time wise with potential downside earnings revisions, make-or-break decision time for the Fed, and election uncertainty. The risk is that one or more of those catalysts prove to be longer lasting, turning a pullback into something more,\u201d he said. A global view: The United States isn\u2019t the only country with an upcoming election. France and the UK both face elections in the coming weeks. While opinion polls suggest the opposition centre-left Labour Party is heading for a comfortable victory in the UK on July 4, the situation in France is much more uncertain, and markets have been rattled. French President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election after his centrist Renaissance party lost heavily to the far-right opposition in European elections. The first round of the French election will be held on June 30, with a second round on July 7. \u201cPolitical uncertainty is a near-term headwind to both sentiment (reflected through financial markets) and, now, activity,\u201d wrote Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management, of the upcoming elections. Until July, \u201cwe can anticipate volatility in European equity and debt markets.\u201d Alaska Airlines reaches tentative labor deal with flight attendants Alaska Airlines and its 7,000-member flight attendants union reached a tentative labor deal late Friday, concluding talks that lasted more than a year and a half, reports my colleague Chris Isidore. Terms of the deal have not been released, though the union called it a \u201crecord contract.\u201d The deal likely contains a significant pay raise, which has been a common demand across the airline industry and sought by unions whose members in some cases have not seen a pay increase in years. In April, the union announced to members it was seeking pay raises of between 43% to 56%, depending upon seniority, through 2026. Those pay raises would include back pay covering a period dating back a year and a half that they\u2019ve worked under the terms of the previous contract. In February, flight attendants from Alaska \u2014 along with American, United and Southwest \u2014held unprecedented coordinated\u00a0pickets\u00a0demanding new contracts. Since then, flight attendants at Southwest reached a deal that included an immediate 22.3% raise as of May 1 and $364 million in retroactive wages. Meanwhile, flight attendants at American and United are still seeking new deals. American flight attendants have asked to be released from restrictions so they can go on strike, but even if that is granted there would be months of cooling off periods before they could walk out, under the Railway Labor Act. Apple\u2019s new China problem: ChatGPT is banned there Apple is banking on its upcoming AI features to boost iPhone sales especially in China, where demand has been lagging. But there\u2019s a problem, reports my CNN colleague Samantha Murphy Kelly, ChatGPT \u2014 soon to be integrated into Siri \u2014 is banned in China. In a presentation earlier this month, Apple (AAPL) showed off its proprietary technology called Apple Intelligence to power compelling new AI\u00a0features\u00a0and announced a\u00a0partnership with OpenAI\u00a0to also use its viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity. (When Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry, ChatGPT can step in.) The move signaled how Apple is trying to expedite the latest buzzy technology at a time when tech rivals, such as Microsoft, Google, Meta and Samsung, have already found their AI\u00a0footing. A deal with OpenAI could help Apple close the gap. But\u00a0China\u00a0is one of the first countries in the world to regulate the generative AI technology that powers these popular services. In August, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s top internet watchdog, rolled out\u00a0new guidelines\u00a0for the industry, requiring companies to seek approval before deployment. The organization\u00a0has approved\u00a0more than 100 AI models as of March, all from Chinese companies. According to\u00a0a report\u00a0from the Wall Street Journal Thursday, Apple is looking for a Chinese AI company to partner with ahead of the iPhone\u2019s expected September launch, but it hasn\u2019t reached a deal yet. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The need to find a partner \u2014 and quickly \u2014 comes at a time when Apple\u2019s smartphone sales\u00a0tumbled\u00a0a stunning 10% in the first quarter of this year, according to market research firm IDC, due largely to iPhone sales sharply dropping in China. The company has lost momentum in China as nationalism, a rough economy and increased competition have also hurt sales. China is the company\u2019s second-largest market.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. It\u2019s been smooth sailing for stocks in 2024. The S&P 500 has gained nearly 15% and has been on a steady upward trend for the past two months. Treasuries have been more volatile, thrown around by the swings in inflation data, hints about future policy decisions from Federal Reserve officials and higher-for-longer interest rates. But following a spike in yields in April and May, they\u2019ve calmed a little and should end the first half nearly even. The relatively benign picture for investors could be about to change, however. The Fed is preparing markets for the possibility that there could be no rate cuts this year. Add to that the noise surrounding the US election, and it could be a rougher second half. Fed foibles: Treasury yields, which go up as prices fall, have moved higher this week as investors reacted to comments from Fed officials downplaying interest rate cut expectations. On Tuesday, Fed governor Michelle Bowman said that she\u2019s expecting no rate cuts this year. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said Monday the Fed must be agile and \u201cif inflation falls more slowly than expected, the policy rate must stay higher for longer.\u201d Meanwhile, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee was also particularly hawkish in his views, saying Monday that he would need to see \u201cmore months\u201d of weaker inflation data to even begin to consider cutting rates. Recent data is also spooking investors. Central Banks in Canada and the eurozone have both cut interest rates, but inflation rose in both of those regions last month. Australia, meanwhile, saw its inflation rate rise to 4% this week, stoking fears that the Reserve Bank of Australia could soon move to raise rates again. Debt, deficits and debates: The unknowns of the current election cycle have also thrown investors for a loop \u2013\u2014 especially since neither President Joe Biden nor former President Donald Trump has indicated they plan to rein in the yawning budget deficit. \u201cWith rates back on the upswing due to international price pressure concerns, an important consideration will be whether government debt, deficits and issuance will begin to matter again,\u201d said Jos\u00e9\u00a0Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.. As debt goes up, investors often require a higher payout to purchase long-term Treasuries. That could also impact markets. The last 10% correction in stocks occurred as the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5% in October, Torres noted. Earlier this week, 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists warned in an open letter that a second Trump administration wouldn\u2019t just fail to fix inflation \u2014 it would make matters worse. The letter, organized by famed economist Joseph Stiglitz, argued there are valid reasons to worry the Trump agenda will \u201creignite\u201d inflation. In particular, the economists point to Trump\u2019s \u201cfiscally irresponsible budgets\u201d and nonpartisan research from the likes of the Peterson Institute, Oxford Economics and Allianz that finds the Trump agenda \u2014 if successfully enacted \u2014 would increase inflation. What it means: For American consumers, a rising 10-year Treasury yield means more economic pain: expensive car loans, higher credit card rates and even more expensive student debt. It also means that the cost of mortgages could increase. When 10-year Treasury yields go up, so do mortgage rates; when they go down, mortgage rates tend to follow. What comes next: Investors are awaiting key economic data this week. The Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, is out on Friday. That will provide investors with more information about economic forecasts and potential interest rate cuts. The US presidential debate is being hosted by CNN Thursday evening. Boeing blames missing paperwork for Alaska Air incident, prompting NTSB rebuke The missing paperwork on the 737 Max that lost a door plug on an Alaska Airlines flight in January made it difficult to find out who made the near tragic mistake. The paperwork may have also caused the problem in the first place, Boeing disclosed this week. It was already well known that no documentation was found to show who worked on the door plug. What was disclosed this week at a briefing for journalists at Boeing\u2019s 737 Max factory in Renton, Washington, is that lack of paperwork is why the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place were never installed before the plane left the factory in October. The workers who needed to reinstall the bolts never had the work order telling them the work needed to be done. Without the bolts, the door plug incident was pretty much inevitable. Luckily, it wasn\u2019t fatal. It\u2019s a sign of the problems with the quality of work along the Boeing assembly lines. Those problems have become the focus of multiple federal investigations and whistleblower revelations, and the cause of delays in jet deliveries that are causing headaches for airlines and passengers around the globe. But Boeing may have landed itself in even more trouble with regulators for divulging the details at this stage.\u00a0The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reprimanded Boeing Thursday for releasing \u201cnon-public investigative information\u201d to the media. It said in a statement that the company had \u201cblatantly violated\u201d the agency\u2019s rules. During the Tuesday briefing, Boeing said that the particular problem with the Alaska Air door plug occurred because two different groups of employees at the plant were charged with doing the work, with one removing and the other reinstalling the door plug as the plane was passing along the assembly line.

NBC to use AI version of announcer Al Michaels\u2019 voice for Olympics recaps NBC is bringing a version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the\u00a0Olympics this summer\u00a0with an unlikely twist: His voice will be powered by artificial intelligence. NBC announced on Wednesday it will use AI software to recreate Michaels\u2019 voice to deliver daily recaps of the Summer Games for subscribers of its Peacock streaming platform, a milestone for the use of AI by a major media company. The use of an AI voice for the Olympics comes as the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, sound and text. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries, such as journalism, about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. A new tool, called \u201cYour Daily Olympic Recap on Peacock,\u201d will enable 10-minute highlights packages, which can include events updates, athlete back stories and other related content personalized by\u00a0subscriber preferences. The company said the highlights could be packaged in about 7 million different ways, pulled from 5,000 hours of live coverage in Paris, effectively making AI (the artificial intelligence, not the man)\u00a0a significantly more efficient way to deliver personalized recaps. \u201cWhen I was approached about this, I was skeptical but obviously curious,\u201d Michaels said in a press release. \u201cThen I saw a demonstration detailing what they had in mind. I said, \u2018I\u2019m in.\u2019\u201d A NBC spokesperson told CNN Michaels is being compensated for his involvement.

The Recording Industry Association of America \u2013 the trade group on behalf of labels including Sony Music Entertainment, UMG Recordings and Warner Records \u2013 filed two copyright infringement cases against AI companies Suno and Uncharted Labs, the developer behind Udio, for training their AI models with the labels\u2019 unlicensed sound recordings. Udio is the company behind \u201cBBL Drizzy,\u201d the AI-generated song that went viral last month during the Kendrick Lamar and Drake spat. Udio was founded last year by former Google DeepMind researchers to make it \u201ceasy for anyone to create emotionally resonant music in an instant,\u201d according to the company. In April, it raised $10 million in funding. Meanwhile, Suno raised $125 million in funding last month. The platform, which allows users to create songs with only a few prompts, relies on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT for lyrics and title development. Udio and Suno did not immediately respond to a request for comment. RIAA CEO Mitch Glazier said in a statement that the lawsuits are \u201cnecessary to reinforce the most basic rules of the road for the responsible, ethical, and lawful development of generative AI systems and to bring Suno\u2019s and Udio\u2019s blatant infringement to an end.\u201d He added that the music community is already partnering and collaborating with \u201cresponsible developers to build sustainable AI tools\u201d that put artists and songwriters in charge, but unlicensed services can exploit an artist\u2019s work \u201cwithout consent or pay set back \u2026 .\u201d In April, more than 200 artists, including Billie Eilish, Kacey Musgraves, J Balvin, Ja Rule, Jon Bon Jovi, The Jonas Brothers, Katy Perry, Miranda Lambert and more, signed an open letter\u00a0organized by the non-profit Artist Rights Alliance calling on AI developers, technology companies, platforms and digital music services to \u201ccease the use of artificial intelligence to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists.\u201d The lawsuit against Udio states \u201cif developed with the permission and participation of copyright owners, generative AI tools will be able to assist humans in creating and producing new and innovative music.\u201d It added: \u201cBut if developed irresponsibly, without regard for fundamental copyright protections, those same tools threaten enduring and irreparable harm to recording artists, record labels, and the music industry, inevitably reducing the quality of new music available to consumers and diminishing our shared culture.\u201d Meanwhile, the lawsuit against Suno states the company has over 10,000,000 users generating music files using the platform, bringing in about 2,000,000 streams. \u201cThese digital music files have been released to the public\u2014some already finding their way onto the major streaming services\u2014and compete with the copyrighted sound recordings that enabled their creation; yet Suno sought no permission from and gives no credit or compensation to the human artists or other rightsholders whose works fueled their creation.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context and developments.

{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have polar opposite views on the economy \u2014 and both undoubtedly will try to sell you on their visions, policies and records. To make heads or tails of what they say (or if you\u2019re trying to impress anyone you might be watching the debate with), it\u2019s good to make sure you understand the economy we\u2019re in right now. Disclaimer: The topics below are in no way an exhaustive list of everything going on in the US economy, plus, everyone experiences it differently. Unemployment: Low, but with warning signs ahead The nation\u2019s unemployment rate stayed below 4% for 27 months, its longest such streak and a match for a period in the 1960s. That streak ended last month, when the unemployment rate rose to 4% from 3.9%. At the same time, the number of job openings in the US recently fell to a new three-year low, another sign of cooling in the labor market. That means job seekers might find it harder to get hired. In particular, the job market for recent college graduates has weakened. The unemployment rate for bachelor\u2019s degree recipients aged 20 to 29 is above 12%, an almost four-percentage-point increase from a year ago, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Inflation: Elevated, but cooling Inflation slowed more than expected last month, falling to 3.3% from 3.4% in April. By comparison, at this time last year it was 4%, and two years ago it was 9%. But there\u2019s a reason why you\u2019re probably feeling like everything is still really expensive. While discounts are starting to appear more at big-box retailers like Target and Walmart and fast-food giants like McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s, price cuts aren\u2019t occurring across the board. That\u2019s because when inflation cools off, it simply means that the pace of price increases is slowing. However, it does not mean that the actual prices we pay for goods and services are lower than they were a year ago. Housing: Still unaffordable Home prices are at a record high and have been climbing for 11 straight months as housing shortages persist. That\u2019s partly because many homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgages during the pandemic don\u2019t want to move and risk having to pay a much higher mortgage rate. Average 30-year fixed-rate mortgages recently hit the highest level of the year. While they\u2019ve started to fall, mortgage rates are still higher than anything seen in the decade before 2022. Mortgage rates are so high in part because inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. As a result, the central bank has held off cutting interest rates, which would otherwise make it cheaper to get a mortgage. In turn, many would-be homebuyers are renting for longer than they otherwise may have, which is driving rents higher, too.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/business/economy-election-presidential-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_business_nike-sales-stock", "text": "Nike posted sluggish growth as the largest sportswear brand in the world faced rising competition, a consumer pullback in its key markets and strategy missteps. Nike\u2019s sales grew 1% last year and were flat last quarter, the company reported Thursday. The company projects sales to drop 10% next quarter as the company\u2019s classic brands slow down and Nike faces challenges in the online marketplace. Nike (NKE) stock plunged 12% during after-hours trading. Nike faces a consumer slowdown for discretionary goods and\u00a0tough competition\u00a0from upstart running brands like Hoka and On. Customers are changing their behaviors, passing up discretionary purchases of expensive sneakers and athletic clothing for basics and experiences such as concerts and travel. Nike is also facing new competition. Hoka, a French brand founded as a running shoe for hardcore marathoners that soon caught on in the mainstream, is growing thanks to its emphasis on comfort over traditional style. Meanwhile, Nike\u2019s effort to change its distribution strategy has backfired. The company in recent years has slashed the number of traditional retailers it sells its goods to while shifting to grow directly through its own channels, especially online. Nike has said it can make more than double the profit\u00a0selling goods\u00a0through its own website and physical stores than it can through wholesale partners. Nike has said it would focus its resources, marketing and top products on just 40 select retail partners, such as Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and Foot Locker. But the change hurt Nike\u2019s sales. Nike has since brought back some of the retailers it initially cut out. \u201cNike took it too far and underestimated the importance of third-party retailers. This withdrawal opened the door for those retailers to partner more closely with other brands,\u201d Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients Thursday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/business/nike-sales-stock/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

NBC announced on Wednesday it will use AI software to recreate Michaels\u2019 voice to deliver daily recaps of the Summer Games for subscribers of its Peacock streaming platform, a milestone for the use of AI by a major media company. The use of an AI voice for the Olympics comes as the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, sound and text. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries, such as journalism, about how artificial intelligence can \u2013 or even should \u2013 be used. A new tool, called \u201cYour Daily Olympic Recap on Peacock,\u201d will enable 10-minute highlights packages, which can include events updates, athlete back stories and other related content personalized by subscriber preferences. The company said the highlights could be packaged in about 7 million different ways, pulled from 5,000 hours of live coverage in Paris, effectively making AI (the artificial intelligence, not the man) a significantly more efficient way to deliver personalized recaps.  \u201cWhen I was approached about this, I was skeptical but obviously curious,\u201d Michaels said in a press release. \u201cThen I saw a demonstration detailing what they had in mind.

NBC said the AI system was trained using prior NBC broadcast audio from Michaels. The company said a team of NBC Sports editors will review all of the content, including audio and clips, to make sure everything is factually accurate and names are pronounced correctly.

But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_27_media_nfl-verdict-sunday-ticket-antitrust-trial", "text": "A jury ordered the NFL on Thursday to pay more than $4.7 billion for anti-trust violations surrounding its \u201cSunday Ticket\u201d package, which lets fans watch games outside of their home markets but required them to buy access to a bundle of games to do so. Because of the case\u2019s nature as an anti-trust matter, the verdict could be tripled if upheld, putting the NFL on the hook for $14.1 billion in damages. But the league, America\u2019s most popular source of television programming, has already vowed to appeal. The verdict is large enough that if it withstands appeal, it would be a financial blow even to America\u2019s richest, most popular and profitable sport. The NFL\u2019s annual revenue was more than $18 billion last year, according to estimates, and Commissioner Roger Goodell has set an annual revenue target of $25 billion by 2027. Rights fees are the major driver of that revenue stream, but this decision could shake up those deals and others across professional sports, changing the way teams make money. The case, first brought in 2015, focused on the NFL\u2019s package of games outside of a local market that are not shown nationally on other networks. Attorneys for the plaintiffs in the class action suit argued that by restricting broadcasts of those \u201cout-of-market\u201d games to the \u201cSunday Ticket\u201d package, the NFL is forcing customers who just want to watch one team or a small group of teams to pay more. \u201cGiven the relatively low cost of internet streaming and satellite and cable television carriage, each team acting independently would offer their games at a competitive price to anybody in the country who wanted to watch that particular team,\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys argued in a filing. \u201cInstead, however, the teams have all forgone this option in favor of creating a more lucrative monopoly.\u201d Bill Carmody, the lead attorney in the case, told CNN that the Los Angeles jury was out fewer than two hours. \u201cJustice was done, and it was a great day for consumers everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a real decisive win.\u201d During arguments, the plaintiffs had argued that fans of specific teams should be able to buy packages of just the games they want to watch, not the entire league\u2019s worth of out-of-market games. But the jury did not rule on whether that will happen now. It only issued a decision on the amount of damages. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I sure hope so,\u201d Carmody said when asked if individual game or team packages would now be offered. \u201cThat question is something the court is going to deal with separately.\u201d The NFL has argued that it provides the best value for its fans to watch a wide selection of games for free on broadcast networks, and other games without additional charge for those who have cable, satellite or streaming services. \u201cWe are disappointed with the jury\u2019s verdict today in the NFL Sunday Ticket class action lawsuit,\u201d the NFL said in a statement Thursday. \u201cWe continue to believe that our media distribution strategy, which features all NFL games broadcast on free over-the-air television in the markets of the participating teams and national distribution of our most popular games\u2026 is by far the most fan friendly distribution model in all of sports and entertainment.\u00a0We will certainly contest this decision as we believe that the class action claims in this case are baseless and without merit.\u201d The case focused on the package as it had been offered by DirecTV, which had held the exclusive Sunday Ticket package until it lost it to\u00a0Google-owned YouTube TV\u00a0at the start of last season, which the Wall Street Journal reported cost\u00a0$2 billion a year.

{"id": "2024_06_27_business_walgreens-closures", "text": "Walgreens is set to close a substantial number of its roughly 8,600 locations across the United States as the company looks to reset the struggling pharmaceutical chain\u2019s business. The company didn\u2019t announce a specific number of store closures, but it said Thursday that it is planning \u201csignificant\u201d closures of underperforming\u00a0stores across America as part of a multiyear optimization program. CEO Tim Wentworth said on a call with analysts Thursday that \u201cchanges are imminent\u201d for the roughly 25% of stores that aren\u2019t profitable and Walgreens\u2019 strategic review will \u201cinclude the closure\u00a0of a significant\u00a0portion of these underperforming stores.\u201d \u201cWe are at a point where the current pharmacy model is not sustainable and the challenges in our operating environment require we approach the market differently,\u201d he said. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal Thursday, Wentworth said the closures would focus on locations that aren\u2019t profitable, too close to each other or stores struggling with theft. Walgreens revealed few additional details about the closures on the call, but said they would take place over the next three years. The company also said it will consider additional closures if performance doesn\u2019t improve. The \u201cvast majority\u201d of employees working at affected stores will be offered jobs elsewhere, Wentworth said. Stock plunges on weak outlook Walgreens\u2019 (WBA) shares fell 20% to its lowest level in decades. The company also said in its earnings statement that it has slashed its full-year profit outlook. \u201cWe continue to face a difficult operating environment, including persistent pressures on the\u00a0US\u00a0consumer and the impact of recent marketplace dynamics which have eroded pharmacy margins,\u201d Wentworth said in a press release. \u201cOur results and outlook reflect these headwinds.\u201d Inflation has taken a big bite out of the drug store business \u2013 both at the front-end and the back-end of pharmacies. Shoppers are \u201cbecoming increasingly selective\u00a0and price sensitive\u00a0on their selections,\u201d Wentworth said on the call, adding that he forecasts the \u201coperating environment to remain challenging\u201d in the US and doesn\u2019t \u201cexpect an improvement.\u201d Sales rose 2.6% to $36.4 billion for the quarter. That might not \u201clook unreasonable, but this is running below inflation and, across some segments of the business, represents a loss of market share,\u201d Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in a note. Particularly concerning for Walgreens was its retail sales falling 4% for the quarter. But that isn\u2019t surprising because it\u2019s front-of-store struggles have been \u201cexacerbated by the cost-of-living crisis which has seen customers curtailing the volume of products they buy and shopping around more for the best deals and bargains,\u201d Saunders added. Walgreens slashed prices on more than 1,000 items in May, following rivals in an effort to lure back inflation-weary shoppers turned off by high prices. But the company said Thursday that would hurt its profitability. Struggles for drug stores Major drugstore chains, including CVS (CVS) and Rite Aid, have struggled in recent years because of declining profits from filling prescriptions. They\u2019ve declined because of lower reimbursement rates for prescription drugs and new competition from Amazon. The front end of drugstores, where they sell snacks and household staples, also face pressure from larger competitors, including Target and dollar stores. Wentworth said in the call that Walgreens\u2019 store assortment will change and it has removed eight national brands and instead started selling similar items produced by its house brands or \u201cpreferred partners.\u201d He didn\u2019t specify which brands that have been eliminated, but said it was within the health and wellness categories. Although drugstores benefited during the pandemic from people getting Covid-19 vaccines, fewer consumers are visiting stores to shop. Prescription volumes are also falling because people are getting fewer elective procedures. GLP-1 drugs, which include Ozempic and Mounjaro to treat weight loss and diabetes hasn\u2019t been a boon for the chain. Wentworth told the Journal it\u2019s losing money on filling those prescriptions. Pivoting the business model hasn\u2019t helped, either. Walgreens will no longer have a majority stake in VillageMD, a primary care network that the chain once had major plans to open full-service doctors\u2019 offices in hundreds of its stores. Walgreens said the value of its ill-fated VillageMD merger has fallen so much, it was forced to take a massive $6 billion writedown on its balance sheet. In the past few years, CVS has closed about 900 locations and Rite Aid, which entered bankruptcy in October, closed more than 100. \u2013CNN\u2019s Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/business/walgreens-closures/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_24_business_boeing-doj-criminal-faa-737-max", "text": "Prosecutors are urging the US Justice Department to file criminal charges against Boeing for safety issues surrounding its 737 Max, although top Justice Department officials haven\u2019t made a final decision, a source familiar with the development tells CNN. The possible criminal charges are just the latest severe blow to the reputation of Boeing, a company once known for the quality and safety of its commercial jets. Beyond two fatal crashes of the 737 Max in 2018 and 2019, the company has faced a series of questions about the safety and quality of its jets. In January, a door plug on a 737 Max flown by Alaska Air blew out early in a flight, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jet, further damaging Boeing\u2019s reputation. The Justice Department and Boeing had reached an agreement in January of 2021 to settle charges that alleged the company defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration during the certification process of the 737 Max before it could carry its first passengers. The plane started service in 2017, but suffered two fatal crashes \u2013 in October 2018 and March of 2019 \u2013 which led to a 20-month grounding of the jet. The cause of the crashes proved to be a design flaw, Boeing has admitted. The 2021 settlement would have spared Boeing any criminal liability despite the Justice Department\u2019s statement at that time that \u201cmisleading statements, half-truths, and omissions communicated by Boeing employees to the FAA\u201d had hidden potential problems with the the design flaw. Reuters first reported the charging recommendation. Boeing declined to comment on that report earlier Monday, nor did it have any comment when reached again Monday evening. Boeing has told prosecutors that it will contest claims that it violated the 2021 deal. Some family members of the crash victims and members of Congress harshly criticized the 2021 deal, known as a deferred prosecution agreement, which spared Boeing from criminal charges at that time. And this month a group of those family members wrote a letter to the Justice Department urging Boeing be hit with the maximum possible $24.9 billion fine. The letter they wrote to the Justice department called Boeing\u2019s actions \u201cthe deadliest corporate crime in U.S. history.\u201d Boeing had just over $6.9 billion cash on hand as of its last quarterly earnings statement in late March. The 2021 deferred prosecution agreement was due to expire this past January, freeing Boeing from the risk of criminal liability. But just days before that deadline expired, the Alaska Air incident happened. The charges against Boeing don\u2019t mean any Boeing executive will face charges as an individual. But it could add to the company\u2019s deep financial problems. It has posted core operating losses of $31.9 billion since the start of the 20-month grounding of the 737 Max that followed its second fatal crash in 2019. The company is at risk of losing its investment grade credit rating for the first time in its history. If its debt falls into junk bond status, its cost of borrowing money that it needs to cover losses will soar. At its most extreme, Boeing could be found ineligible to do business with the federal government if found guilty of a crime. That would be an virtual death sentence for Boeing, which gets 37% of its revenue in 2023 from US government contracts. But such a penalty is highly unlikely for reasons of national security, since most of those contracts are with the Department of Defense. But if the company faces criminal charges, a new settlement is the most likely outcome. And such a settlement would likely include some manner of additional oversight of the company\u2019s operations, perhaps in the form of a federal monitor, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace and defense management consultant.

{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_tech_china-huawei-harmony-os-growth-intl-hnk", "text": "Huawei is in the midst of one of the most stunning comebacks in the history of the tech industry. The Chinese giant, which has been a flashpoint in the escalating rivalry between Washington and Beijing, says more than 900 million smartphones now use its in-house operating system Harmony OS. \u201cWe have done in 10 years what our European and American counterparts have done in more than 30 years, and have achieved independent control of the core technology of the operating system,\u201d Richard Yu, the chairman of Huawei\u2019s consumer business group, said at a developer forum on Friday. Harmony, which is called \u201cHongmeng\u201d in Chinese, was first unveiled in 2019, months after Huawei was placed on a US trade blacklist that barred American firms from\u00a0selling tech and software\u00a0to the Chinese tech company without a license. US policymakers have long claimed that Huawei poses a national security risk, alleging that the Chinese government could use the company\u2019s equipment to spy. The company repeatedly denied those allegations, but that didn\u2019t stop some American allies \u2014 such as the UK \u2014 limiting Huawei\u2019s role in building 5G networks. The US ban prevented companies like Google\u00a0(GOOGL)\u00a0from supplying new Huawei devices with its version of Android OS. Those restrictions dealt a huge blow to the Chinese firm\u2019s smartphone ambitions at the time, with some analysts predicting the Huawei phone would become \u201ca brick.\u201d Now the company is once again making its way back to the top. It\u2019s also venturing into new businesses. Last year, it launched an electric sedan to take on Tesla\u2019s Model S. And it has big ambitions in artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia (NVDA), which is running neck and neck with Microsoft (MSFT) as the\u00a0most valuable public company\u00a0in the world, earlier this year named Huawei a top competitor in a number of areas, including in the\u00a0production of processors\u00a0that power AI systems. Yu said Friday that Huawei\u2019s own AI framework, composed of its Ascend processors, was 1.1 times more effective in training large language models than mainstream international offerings. He did not name the competitors. A surprise development But it\u2019s in smartphones that the revival is so far most obvious. Sales of Huawei\u2019s flagship smartphones rose 72% in the first five months of 2024, compared to the same period a year ago, Yu added, underscoring the company\u2019s ambitions to claw its way back to the top despite severe US restrictions. The Shenzhen-based conglomerate\u2019s popular Mate 60 Pro smartphone made headlines last year when the US government\u00a0sought more information\u00a0about the model, which included a sophisticated processor. Its debut shocked industry experts who questioned how the company could\u00a0acquire\u00a0such  chips following sweeping efforts by the US to restrict China\u2019s access to foreign chip technology because of national security concerns. The company\u2019s net profit soared 564% to $2.71 billion in the first quarter, and that robust jump comes after it recorded its\u00a0fastest revenue growth\u00a0in four years in 2023, thanks to a pick-up in its consumer segment and income from new businesses like smart car components. Huawei is also going after another of the biggest companies in the world. The success of its smartphones in China have directly impacted Apple (AAPL) in the premium segment, according to data from Counterpoint Research in April. The iPhone maker, which led China\u2019s smartphone market with a near 20% share in the first quarter of 2023, fell to third spot in the first three months of\u00a0this\u00a0year, according to Counterpoint. Its market share stood at 15.7%, while Huawei\u2019s jumped to 15.5%, from 9.3% in 2023. Sales of the iPhone began bouncing back in May, after the company aggressively cut prices in its largest overseas market.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/tech/china-huawei-harmony-os-growth-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_business_consumers-are-pulling-back-but-theyre-still-going-out-for-steak", "text": "\u201cGod I love Texas Roadhouse,\u201d began one thread on Reddit, with over 1,000 upvotes. \u201cTexas Roadhouse never disappoints,\u201d began another, with over 5,000 votes. A third touted the \u201cincredible value.\u201d If there\u2019s anything Americans love, it\u2019s cheap meat. So business is booming at Texas Roadhouse and LongHorn Steakhouse, even as Americans pull back elsewhere. In the quarter ending on March 26, sales at company-owned Texas Roadhouse locations open at least 18 months jumped 8.4% compared to the year before. And in the three months through May 26, sales at Longhorn Steakhouse locations open at least 16 months rose 4%. Longhorn, which is owned by Darden Restaurants, outperformed the other chains in Darden\u2019s portfolio, including Olive Garden. That\u2019s all happening as Americans curtail retail spending and plan to shell out less for vacations this summer. Most restaurant chains are feeling the heat, with even McDonald\u2019s reporting that lower-income consumers are pulling back. The two eateries have a history of performing well during periods of economic uncertainty \u2014\u00a0a few years ago, the pair were standouts as inflation-weary Americans began to pull back on spending. It may seem counterintuitive for sales at steakhouses to rise when people feel short on cash. But both Texas Roadhouse and Longhorn Steakhouse seem to have done what every restaurant wishes it could: Make people feel like they\u2019re getting a good deal when they need it most. An affordable luxury When it comes to steakhouses, Texas Roadhouse and LongHorn Steakhouse are on the cheaper end, noted Jim Salera, a research analyst at Stephens. \u201cThat average meal at Longhorn or Texas Roadhouse is actually very affordable,\u201d when compared to local establishments or higher-end chains like STK Steakhouse. The average check per person at Longhorn Steakhouse was $26, Salera said, according to a recent presentation from the Cheesecake Factory, which outlined its competitors\u2019 pricing. At Texas Roadhouse, the average check was $22. \u201cFor their core consumer, it really represents an affordable luxury,\u201d Salera said. Americans might sacrifice vacations or spend less on home goods to save money, but still feel comfortable splurging on a night out. \u201cNo one gives up everything at the same time.\u201d And it might not feel like such a splurge when you\u2019re getting a hearty meal of meat and potatoes. As a recent Bank of America note discussing Longhorn\u2019s results put it: \u201cConsumers recognize the center-of-plate value offered by steak.\u201d Plus, those checks may appear especially reasonable when fast food and other restaurants\u2019 prices are way up. Many restaurant chains have hiked their prices since the pandemic, not only because of high costs, but because they realized that diners would pay. Frustrated customers are finally pushing back, prompting restaurant chains to try to reverse course by offering short-term discounts and meal deals (but not lowering their overall prices). In contrast, both Longhorn and Texas Roadhouse have, made a point of keeping their regular prices relatively low, BTIG restaurant analyst Peter Saleh told CNN. They\u2019ve been trying to raise prices below inflation \u201cfor a while now,\u201d he said.  That approach could be why Texas Roadhouse and Longhorn Steakhouse consistently earn top marks on the American Customer Satisfaction Index, Saleh noted. Longhorn has also made moves to improve its menu. Back in June 2022, Darden CEO Rick Cardenas said during an analyst call that the chain \u201chas made significant investments over the past few years in the quality of their food.\u201d Might as well go out It\u2019s not just about low prices compared to other restaurants. It\u2019s also about what\u2019s happening at the supermarket. While grocery prices overall have been moderating, beef has stayed expensive. In the 12 months through May, uncooked beef steaks\u2019 prices went up 5.7%, according to inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. When people see pricey steaks in the meat aisle, it\u2019s easier for them to justify going out for a nice steak dinner, noted Salera. Texas Roadhouse also mentioned the trend during a recent analyst call. \u201cRetail demand has been probably a little bit weaker,\u201d said Michael Bailen, senior director of investor relations at Texas Roadhouse. That has likely \u201cled to a benefit for us.\u201d Bailen noted that grocers may be offering deals on certain cuts, like strip steaks, but not ribeyes, making restaurant ribeyes seem like a steal in comparison. Going out to eat can also release the anxiety some shoppers feel about ruining a supermarket steak, Salera said. \u201cFrom the consumer perspective they\u2019ll say, \u2018Okay, rather than me buy a steak at Kroger and then bring it home and mess it up, I can just pay somebody to prepare it for me.\u2019\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/business/consumers-are-pulling-back-but-theyre-still-going-out-for-steak/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_06_27_business_boeing-cause-alaska-air-door-plug", "text": "For months, missing paperwork has hindered the investigation into how a door plug blew off a 737 Max on an Alaska Airlines flight in January, making it difficult to find out who made the near tragic mistake. This week, Boeing disclosed that the paperwork may have caused the problem in the first place. It was already well known that no documentation was found to show who worked on the door plug, which came off the plane after it had reached around 16,000 feet in the air causing an uncontrolled decompression, which injured a few passengers and even tore one\u2019s shirt off. But at a briefing for journalists at Boeing\u2019s 737 Max factory in Renton, Washington, Boeing said that the lack of paperwork is why the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place were never installed before the plane left the factory in October. The workers who needed to reinstall the bolts never had the work order telling them the work needed to be done. Without the bolts, the door plug incident was pretty much inevitable. Luckily, it wasn\u2019t fatal. It\u2019s a sign of the problems with the quality of work along the Boeing assembly lines. Those problems have become the focus of multiple federal investigations and whistleblower revelations, and the cause of delays in jet deliveries that are causing headaches for airlines and passengers around the globe. Boeing may have stepped in it\u2026 again But Boeing may have landed itself in even more trouble with regulators for divulging the details at this stage. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reprimanded Boeing Thursday for releasing \u201cnon-public investigative information\u201d to the media. It said in a statement that the company had \u201cblatantly violated\u201d the agency\u2019s rules. \u201cDuring a media briefing Tuesday about quality improvements\u2026 a Boeing executive provided investigative information and gave an analysis of factual information previously released. Both of these actions are prohibited,\u201d the NTSB said. Boeing will no longer have access to information generated by the NTSB during its investigation, the agency said, adding it was referring Boeing\u2019s conduct to the Department of Justice. \u201cAs a party to many NTSB investigations over the past decades, few entities know the rules better than Boeing,\u201d the NTSB said. In a letter sent to Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun Thursday, NTSB Office of Aviation Safety Director Timothy LeBaron said this week\u2019s media briefing was done without the consent or knowledge of the regulator. \u201cBoeing must take all reasonable steps to ensure that investigative information is protected from public release,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSuch a release or withholding of critical information from our investigators are blatant violations of NTSB\u2019s regulations.\u201d Boeing responded that it held the briefing in an effort to \u201ctake responsibility\u201d and be transparent for its role in the incident. It said it \u201cshared context on the lessons we have learned from the\u00a0January 5\u00a0accident.\u201d \u201cWe deeply regret that some of our comments, intended to make clear our responsibility in the accident and explain the actions we are taking, overstepped the NTSB\u2019s role as the source of investigative information,\u201d said Boeing\u2019s statement. \u201cWe apologize to the NTSB and stand ready to answer any questions as the agency continues its investigation.\u201d The NTSB also chastised Boeing for stating earlier this month that a rare, unsafe back-and-forth roll during a Southwest 737 Max flight in May was not because of a design or manufacturing error. The NTSB, which is investigating that incident, told Calhoun Thursday it had not made a determination yet and Boeing and the NTSB must speak with one voice when making public statements. Bad paperwork trail Boeing said during the Tuesday briefing that the reason the Alaska Air door plug was not probably secured in the first place was because two different groups of employees at the plant were charged with doing the work, with one removing and the other reinstalling the door plug as the plane was passing along the assembly line. The first group of employees removed the door plug to address problems with some rivets that were made by a supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. But they didn\u2019t generate the paperwork indicating they had removed the door plug, along with\u00a0the four bolts necessary to hold it in place, in order to do that work. When a different group of employees put the plug back in place, Boeing says the employees didn\u2019t think the plane would actually fly in that condition. Instead, they were just blocking the hole with the plug to protect the inside of the fuselage from weather as the plane moved outside to a different area of the factory compound. That group of employees often makes those kind of temporary fixes. \u201cThe doors team closes up the aircraft before it is moved outside, but it\u2019s not their responsibility to install the pins,\u201d said Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president of quality for Boeing\u2019s commercial airplane unit. Those employees likely assumed paperwork existed showing that the plug and bolts had been removed, and that paperwork would prompt someone else along the line to install the bolts. But without the paperwork, no one on the assembly line knew that the door plug had ever been removed, or that its bolts were missing, Lund said. Removing a door plug after a plane arrives from Spirit AeroSystems rarely happens, Lund added, so no one was aware the door plug needed attention. \u201c(Permanent) reinstallation is done by another team based on the paperwork showing what jobs are unfinished,\u201d Lund said. \u201cBut there was no paperwork, so nobody knew to follow up.\u201d An accident waiting to happen The plane actually flew for about two months with the door plug in place despite the lack of bolts. But minutes after the Alaska Airlines flight took off from Portland, Oregon, on January 5, the door plug blew out, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Passengers\u2019 clothing and phones were ripped away from them and sent hurtling into the night sky. But fortunately no passengers were seriously injured, and the crew was able to land the plane safely. The missing bolts had been identified in preliminary findings of the National Transportation Safety Board, but that report did not assess blame for the accident. And a final report is not expected for about a year or more. A spokesperson for the NTSB said that the safety agency is continuing its investigation and will not comment on Boeing\u2019s explanation for how the mistake was made. The board released a preliminary report in February that said it had found the bolts were missing when it left the Boeing factory, but it did not assess blame. A final report is not expected for a year or more. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy has testified about the missing paperwork at Congressional hearings since the preliminary report was released. Boeing is addressing the problem by slowing down its assembly lines, and making sure that planes don\u2019t advance with problems under the assumption that those problems will be dealt with later in the assembly process, Lund said. \u201cWe have slowed down our factories to make sure this is under control,\u201d she said. \u201cI am extremely confident that the actions that we took,\u201d will ensure every airplane leaving this factory is safe, she added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/business/boeing-cause-alaska-air-door-plug/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_business_cdk-global-cyber-attack-update", "text": "Cyberattacks seem to be more devastating than ever and taking targeted companies even longer to resolve. The latest attack to receive wide attention continues that trend: An ongoing cyber incident at CDK Global, whose software car dealerships use to manage everything from scheduling to records, has crippled dealerships for days now, with no clear end in sight. In May, a cyberattack on Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit network that includes 140 hospitals in 19 states, forced the system to divert ambulances from several of its hospitals. It took almost a month to fully resolve the issue. And in February ransomware attack on Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of healthcare giant UnitedHealth Group, caused billing disruptions at pharmacies across the US and\u00a0threatened to put\u00a0some health providers out of business. Experts say hackers are getting more sophisticated and can hide in  an organization\u2019s systems for longer undetected. These hackers target companies in a supply chain-style attack, taking down entire industries to leverage more money. And certain industries that often use outdated systems, like healthcare, are becoming even easier targets. \u201cWe can\u2019t even compare what was going on ten years ago to what\u2019s going on today,\u201d Dror Liwer, co-founder of cybersecurity company Coro, told CNN. \u201c(Hackers) are in the game for much bigger gains than they were before.\u201d Why hacks are so much more devastating Hackers are not just more sophisticated, but they\u2019re also more patient, Liwer said. Hackers hide themselves inside an organization\u2019s framework for a while, and move laterally through that framework, affecting numerous parts of the system. They wait until it\u2019s the right time to launch attacks. And the longer the hackers wait, the bigger the damage. \u201cWhen (hackers) turn the attack on and execute, it\u2019s truly crippling to the organization which then generates more revenue for them,\u201d Liwer said. Experts with whom CNN spoke said it\u2019s difficult to get specific details on individual cyberattacks immediately. For one thing, companies want to protect their brand reputation from potential litigation. Also, organizations may not want to reveal specific details of the attack before an investigation concludes, the experts said, in case there are any copycats. Eric Noonan, CEO of cybersecurity provider CyberSheath, said that ransomware attacks typically breach through avenues like a phishing email. These breaches can go undetected for days or even weeks as the hacker moves laterally. The actual deployment of ransomware is often quick and widespread, Noonan said. Most victims find out they\u2019ve been hacked once they lose access to important files or receive digital ransom notes. \u201cRansomware is the digital equivalent of squatters taking over a home. The initial entry goes unnoticed allowing the squatters to occupy and control the property and by the time homeowners notice there is a problem the process for regaining control and ownership is disruptive and expensive,\u201d Noonan said. While companies used less interconnected systems in the past, the move to the cloud and reliance on third-party systems \u2014 despite helping daily business operations \u2014 creates complex systems that are more susceptible to widespread hacks. \u201cIt also creates kind of a bullseye and it helps attackers focus their efforts on specific types of infrastructure or specific cloud platforms,\u201d Noonan said. And hackers are targeting organizations that serve in the supply chain of industries. By attacking CDK\u2019s software, for instance, hackers were able to bring the vehicle dealership industry to a standstill. Change and Ascension, large hospital chains, were not able to provide adequate care to their many branches. That gives hackers leverage to ask for larger and larger sums of money, said John Dwyer, director of security research at Binary Defense, a cybersecurity solutions firm. Though hackers have more leverage, the success of paying a ransom and a speedy recovery is elusive, experts said. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a story written on a company that successfully paid a ransom, and then quickly recovered their systems,\u201d Noonan said. Healthcare is an easy target Noonan said the issue isn\u2019t that hackers are necessarily getting more advanced, but that many organizations lack modern, up-to-date systems. Most organizations don\u2019t do incident response exercises, which is why it\u2019s taking longer to recover from these massive hacks. \u201cMuch of our critical infrastructure is way behind in terms of being prepared for recognizing cyber threats when they appear, but then more importantly, recovering from them,\u201d Noonan said. An FBI report found that ransomware attackers targeted the healthcare and public health sector the most, followed by critical manufacturing and government facilities. As systems become more interconnected, there is only so much a business can do to upkeep its cybersecurity \u2013 especially when relying on third party systems, like car dealerships do with CDK. \u201cAuto dealerships are not in the business of cybersecurity, so they aren\u2019t really up to the task of protecting that kind of a system. It\u2019s up to the vendor,\u201d Cliff Steinhauer, director of information security and engagement at National Cybersecurity Alliance said. Steinhauer also said it\u2019s a constant game of \u201ccat and mouse.\u201d \u201cEvery time we fix something, the hacker can still break it. And they only have to be right once, we have to be right every single time,\u201d Steinhauer said. Hospital attacks have surged. A nurse who works at Ascension Providence Rochester Hospital near Detroit, Michigan, previously told CNN that the ransomware attack on the networks is \u201cputting patients\u2019 lives in danger,\u201d as healthcare workers have to resort to paper charting with a load of patients to take care of. Others say healthcare is targeted because of the field\u2019s aging technology, Steven McKeon,\u00a0founder and CEO of software companies MacguyverTech and MacNerd, said in a release. This technology helps patients request prescription refills, view test results and schedule appointments, but is also more susceptible to hacks. CNN has reached out to Ascension and Change for comment. How to prevent long shutdowns Dwyer said companies can do a better job of using third-party expertise since many internal security teams are pretty small. The best examples use an internal team that is an expert on the internal systems of the organization and hire third-party cybersecurity providers to bolster their size. Organizations can also put into place systems that can look at security across their business, Liwer said. Others say there should be mandatory minimum cybersecurity requirements for publicly traded companies. Those minimum standards should be viewed like seatbelts and airbags, Noonan said \u2014 they won\u2019t prevent accidents from happening, but will better prepare companies. \u201cThere\u2019s many software companies or critical parts makers or parts of the supply chains that Americans have never heard of \u2013 these companies, the applications and the software or parts that they make until they\u2019re no longer available. There\u2019s many other CDK\u2019s out there,\u201d Noonan said.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

Critics accuse Levi\u2019s (LEVI) of ignoring its own labor standards after it continued working with a factory in Turkey that fired around 400 people last year after they joined a union and went on strike over pay and working conditions. Turkey is a critical link in the global supply chain for apparel. The country exported around $30 billion worth of apparel and textiles last year, according to the Istanbul Exporters\u2019 Association, a clothing industry group. One player in the industry is Ozak Tekstil\u2019s factory in Turkey\u2019s Sanliurfa region, which exclusively makes jeans for Levi\u2019s. Ozak Tekstil also produces clothing in its other factories in Turkey for brands such as Zara, Hugo Boss, Guess, Mango and Ralph Lauren, according to the report by the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC), published Friday. Seher Gulel worked in quality control at the factory before she was fired in late November. She was paid Turkey\u2019s minimum wage, she told CNN, which at the time was about $15 a day. Pressure, bullying and insults by managers were frequent, she says, and excessively long days were common. She would often work from 8 a.m. until midnight or even into the early morning hours \u2014 even though, under Turkish law, workers should not work more than 11 hours in a day. \u201cThe (illegal) overtime problem was constant,\u201d she said. Ozak Tekstil said its overtime hours and payments were within the law. Months into the job Gulel had had enough. She joined a new union, Birtek-Sen, switching from another one, which she says was ineffective and \u201calways pro-boss.\u201d (The union denies this). Within 10 days of joining Birtek-Sen, she was fired for what Ozak Tekstil called \u201cquality control errors.\u201d Her dismissal provided the spark for hundreds of workers at the factory to walk off the job, according to the WRC report and Gulel. The workers had been on strike for a little over two weeks when Ozak Tekstil made good its threat to fire those who refused to return to work. Roughly 400 were dismissed in mid-December \u2014 almost half the factory\u2019s staff. \u201cWe were looking for justice,\u201d Gulel told CNN. \u201cBut we got injustice. Ozak Tekstil told CNN it had terminated the workers \u201cas a last resort\u201d when they declined an invitation to return to work.\u00a0It also said that, while a Turkish law enshrines the right to strike, under the same law, Birtek-Sen didn\u2019t have enough members to collectively bargain and organize a strike. \u201cSince the day the factory was founded, workers\u2019 right to unionize has always been respected,\u201d Ozak Tekstil said. However, the WRC report says: \u201cThe labor law also flatly prohibits employers from firing workers for striking, even in the case of an illegal strike, unless the country\u2019s labor courts have first ruled that the strike in question is unlawful.\u201d A court did rule that the strike had been illegal but the ruling didn\u2019t come until five months after the firings. In an email between Levi\u2019s and the Birtek-Sen union, shared with CNN by the WRC, Levi\u2019s acknowledged that the mass firings violated its own supplier code of conduct, which states that its factories \u201cshall respect the right to free association and the right to organize and bargain collectively without unlawful interference.\u201d Importantly for Gulel\u2019s case, the code also dictates that suppliers must ensure workers who join the union \u201care not the object of discrimination, harassment, or punitive disciplinary actions.\u201d In that email, dated December 22, 2023, the company also said it had instructed Ozak Tekstil to reinstate the workers. If it refused, \u201cwe will be forced to take the appropriate next steps to uphold workers\u2019 rights,\u201d Levi\u2019s wrote. \u2018Meaningless\u2019 standards But Ozak Tekstil didn\u2019t do what Levi\u2019s was asking. It did not reinstate all of the fired workers. The company told CNN it had offered most of the workers their jobs back (but without the right to continue with the strike), but only a handful had accepted the offer. On April 1, months after the mass dismissals, Levi\u2019s wrote to the WRC reconfirming that its code of conduct had been violated but adding that it was \u201cless clear that exiting Ozak and potentially putting an additional 400 people out of work in the process is how we should proceed.\u201d This is how WRC executive director Scott Nova summarized the situation: \u201cThe factory said no, and Levi\u2019s in the end said, \u2018well, okay, we\u2019ll give you business anyway.\u2019\u201d He called the firings \u201cone of the most brazen, outrageous violations\u201d of workers\u2019 right to strike that he\u2019d seen anywhere in years. \u201cThe message Levi\u2019s is sending to all of its suppliers globally \u2014 of which there are many hundreds \u2014 is that Levi\u2019s labor standards are meaningless. But even though Levi\u2019s says factories have to respect the rights of workers, what Levi\u2019s really wants is cheap blue jeans produced quickly regardless of the consequences for the workers who make them,\u201d Nova said. In a statement to CNN, Levi\u2019s said it had \u201ca\u00a0longstanding commitment to supporting safe, productive workplaces for workers, and we take any allegations of efforts to curtail freedom of association extremely seriously.\u201d It said it continued sourcing jeans from the factory despite the mass firings, to avoid further job losses, but the continuation of its relationship with the supplier depends \u201con management\u2019s fulfillment of a detailed remediation plan that addresses freedom of association, working hours, and health and safety.\u201d As for Gulel\u2019s allegations of excessive overtime and abusive managers at the factory, Levi\u2019s did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Hugo Boss told CNN that, although its products are manufactured at other Ozak Tekstil plants, it was \u201cmonitoring the accusations\u201d at the Sanliurfa factory. \u201cOzak has confirmed that it complies with our social standards, which are mandatory for a business relationship with\u00a0Hugo Boss, and that a trade union has been active in the company for over 10 years,\u201d said Carolin Westermann, a spokesperson for the German brand. \u2018Blacklisted\u2019 While most fired workers received a severance payment, many are now struggling to find a job \u2014 and that may be due to something else they received from Ozak Tekstil: an effective black mark in a publicly accessible government database. Gulel has been out of work for seven months and former union rep Funda Bakis, who was fired in mid-December, for more than six. They both say they\u2019re now \u201cblacklisted.\u201d According to Gulel\u2019s dismissal notice seen by CNN, the official reason for her firing stated in the database is \u201ccode 50,\u201d which means the employee \u201cendangers the safety of the job due to (their) own will or negligence, causes damage and loss to the machines \u2026 to the extent that (they) cannot repay with the amount of (their) 30-day wage.\u201d As for Bakis, she was given \u201ccode 46,\u201d which indicates behavior \u201csuch as abusing the employer\u2019s trust, stealing, revealing the employer\u2019s professional secrets.\u201d Ozak Tekstil didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s question on why it had chosen those codes, beyond insisting the firings had been justified. Nor did Levi\u2019s respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on this issue. Bakis has moved in with her parents and lives alongside more than 10 other people in a three-bedroom apartment, amounting to about 100 square meters (1,076 square feet) of space. Seasonal farm work may now be her only employment option. \u201cWe expected more from Levi\u2019s than from Ozak, because it\u2019s an international company and a brand that talks a lot about humane working conditions,\u201d she said, noting that some of her friends who had also been fired by the factory in December had \u201cchildren at home who were hungry.\u201d According to WRC researchers, who have been in touch with Levi\u2019s for months, the company has no plans to provide monetary assistance or compensation to any of the fired workers. Ozak Tekstil said the mass dismissals in December had \u201cnothing to do with working hours or wages.\u201d \u201cOzak Tekstil is one of the companies that employs personnel in the best working conditions and pays the highest wages in the textile industry in the (Sanliurfa) region,\u201d it added. Gulel and Bakis beg to differ. They are among 21 former employees who are suing Ozak Tekstil for back pay \u2014 including unpaid overtime, severance pay, holiday pay and for working on weekends and national holidays. They are also seeking further compensation because they claim they were fired due to their union ties, according to the lawyer for the group. Ozak Tekstil denies this. \u201cAfter all these rights violations, they took away our bread, they took away our jobs. They didn\u2019t leave anything undone to us, just because we were demanding our rights. But justice never prevailed. I hope it does from now on,\u201d Bakis said.

{"id": "2024_06_26_media_cnn-presidential-debate", "text": "CNN on Thursday\u00a0will do something no network has done in more than 35 years \u2013 host its own general election presidential debate. It is a pivotal moment, not just for the country as it picks a new president, but also for CNN \u2014 with a new leader at the helm of\u00a0the news network that has been beset\u00a0by declining\u00a0television viewership\u00a0as it urgently embarks on a\u00a0major\u00a0newsroom\u00a0overhaul to embrace its digital future. Thursday night\u2019s presidential debate, a marketing coup for CNN and its new chief executive, Mark Thompson,\u00a0will\u00a0offer the network a\u00a0bright spot \u2013 and expectations of\u00a0record\u00a0ratings, even if viewers end up watching the debate on other networks. No matter where viewers\u00a0tune in to watch the primetime matchup between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, it will be clear this is a CNN debate. As a\u00a0public service, CNN has allowed\u00a0other\u00a0networks to air the event,\u00a0so long as they agree to\u00a0the network\u2019s rules\u00a0over\u00a0how the\u00a0event\u00a0is promoted and\u00a0re-broadcast. Rival networks, for example,\u00a0have agreed to\u00a0use CNN in the programming title and keep the\u00a0red CNN logo on screen\u00a0throughout\u00a0the debate. For CNN, the branding boost from the debate may provide a much-needed shot in the arm. Over the last year, CNN\u2019s television viewership has fallen, regularly settling into third place behind MSNBC and the right-wing talk channel Fox News. Last week, CNN total viewership averaged fewer than 500,000 in primetime, and 80,000 in the advertiser-coveted 25-to-54-year-old demographic, according to Nielsen. The declining viewership trend is not unique to CNN. But it has notably taken hold during breaking news events, once seen as the network\u2019s bread and butter, when general audiences turned to the cable channel en masse to watch unfolding coverage. CNN is also looking to move past previous missteps. Last year, under then-network chief Chris Licht, the network hosted a live town hall with Trump, in which the former president unloaded a host of lies and insulted moderator Kaitlan Collins as an audience applauded and cheered. Licht was later fired after a brief but tumultuous tenure. Thursday\u2019s debate offers Thompson and the network\u2019s executives the chance to reset the reputation of a network that has long defined itself as \u201cthe most trusted name in news.\u201d Thursday\u2019s debate will pose a high-stakes test for Thompson and the network\u2019s executives as they go it alone without the independent Commission on Presidential Debates, making key decisions about how the politically charged showdown will appear for the millions expected to tune in. A break in tradition CNN\u2019s debate will include some shifts in tradition,\u00a0including\u00a0two\u00a0commercial breaks during the roughly\u00a090-minute\u00a0event, a first since the Commission on Presidential Debates took over the process more than 35 years ago. Other networks are also free to sell their own advertising but cannot put up their own commentators or anchors during\u00a0the\u00a0breaks. There will be no live audience this time, and the candidates\u2019 microphones will be muted while the other is speaking.\u00a0The podiums will also be eight feet apart, much closer than the last Trump-Biden debate in 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic, when they were positioned 12 feet apart. It\u2019s also the earliest a\u00a0general election\u00a0debate has ever been held,\u00a0coming\u00a0weeks\u00a0before either candidate\u00a0is formally nominated at their party\u2019s conventions. \u201cThat\u2019s by design,\u201d CNN political director David Chalian said. \u201cThe Biden campaign was certainly interested in an earlier debate, in part because I think they see a target universe of voters that they\u2019re trying to reach who aren\u2019t engaged in this election.\u201d Frank Fahrenkopf, co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates, said he was \u201cshocked\u201d\u00a0by how early the debate was taking place in the campaign.\u00a0The commission, which has sponsored the debates since the 1980s,\u00a0\u201cregrettably announced\u201d\u00a0Monday that it was\u00a0cancelling its debates\u00a0for the 2024 election that had been scheduled for September and October. \u201cThe Biden-Harris Campaign informed the Commission that President Biden will not agree to debate under the sponsorship of the Commission during the 2024 general election campaign,\u201d it said. Instead, both candidates have agreed to a second debate in September hosted by ABC. This isn\u2019t\u00a0the first time the commission\u2019s role\u00a0in the debates has been\u00a0challenged. In 2000, then\u00a0Gov.\u00a0George W. Bush challenged then Vice President Al Gore to three debates \u2013 one by the commission, and two other ones to be hosted by CNN and NBC. But in the end, Bush relented, and the candidates debated each other three times in the span of eight days in commission-sponsored debates. Alan Schroeder, a\u00a0journalism\u00a0professor at Northeastern University and author of the book \u201cPresidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trail,\u201d said he\u2019s an \u201caficionado\u201d of the debate commission because of that history. \u201cPresidential debates have a long history of being tampered with by the campaigns, and the commission over its many decades did an excellent job circumventing the political shenanigans and institutionalizing presidential debates as an expectation rather than something that might or might not take place depending on the candidates\u2019 whims and poll standings,\u201d Schroeder said. A new format \u2013 and few fact checks While both Biden and Trump have agreed to the terms of\u00a0CNN\u2019s\u00a0debate, including the format, rules and moderators, the Trump campaign has spent the days leading up to Thursday\u00a0assailing\u00a0the moderators, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, and questioning their objectivity. The move, a page out of the Trump media playbook, is a repeat of the 2020 campaign, when Trump also attacked\u00a0the moderators of the general election debates. \u201cTrump may complain about CNN, but he was quick to accept their sponsorship, so I believe that speaks for itself,\u201d Schroeder said. \u201cTo me it just sounds like whining,\u201d he added. \u201cFor sure, there is an element of trying to \u2018work the refs\u2019 in advance of the event, but I think most people are smart enough to see that for what it is.\u201d One thing that will not be a major feature of this debate:\u00a0fact checking. \u201cWhat we want to make sure that we do here, our role here, is to facilitate, to moderate a debate between these two candidates,\u201d Chalian said. \u201cNot for Jake and Dana to become participants in that debate, but to make sure that President Biden and former President Trump have the ability, have the time and space to get their visions out to the American people on these issues that are top of mind for them.\u201d That means it will be mostly up to the candidates to try\u00a0to\u00a0correct the record on stage should their rival push lies or misinformation, a particularly thorny challenge given Trump\u2019s lengthy history of using major platforms to unleash falsehoods. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult, if not impossible, for moderators to fact-check during a live debate,\u201d Schroeder said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a clear-cut issue that can be dispensed within five seconds \u2013 like a candidate claiming the sky is not blue \u2013 then that\u2019s easy enough to handle, but most issues are a lot more complex than that and cannot be resolved in real time on an immediate basis.\u201d CNN, for its part, plans to offer a fact-check of the candidates\u2019\u00a0claims following the telecast. While CNN and ABC are hosting the debates this election season, Fahrenkopf said he believes the 2024 debates are merely a hiccup in the commission\u2019s long history, and that they\u2019ll be back to sponsoring the debates for the next campaign. \u201cThere are other ways to do things and we\u2019ll look at it, and maybe (the CPD) will learn something from it,\u201d he said. But with the candidates moving to\u00a0circumvent the commission and its rules, some critics have\u00a0suggested it could eventually result in\u00a0highly partisan actors hosting the debates\u00a0in the future.\u00a0But Schroeder said he doesn\u2019t\u00a0believe\u00a0that Thursday\u2019s event will lead to that possibility, since each campaign still must sign off on the\u00a0terms of any\u00a0debate. For now, he said,\u00a0there are still \u201cenough mainstream news organizations.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/media/cnn-presidential-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_business_denmark-cows-carbon-tax", "text": "Dairy farmers in Denmark face having to pay an annual tax of 672 krone ($96) per cow for the planet-heating emissions they generate. The country\u2019s coalition government agreed this week to introduce the world\u2019s first carbon emissions tax on agriculture. It will mean new levies on livestock starting in 2030. Denmark is a major dairy and pork exporter, and agriculture is the country\u2019s biggest source of emissions. The coalition agreement \u2014 which also entails investing 40 billion krone ($3.7 billion) in measures such as reforestation and establishing wetlands \u2014 is aimed at helping the country meet its climate goals. \u201cWith today\u2019s agreement, we are investing billions in the biggest transformation of the Danish landscape in recent times,\u201d Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cAt the same time, we will be the first country in the world with a (carbon) tax on agriculture.\u201d The Danish dairy industry broadly welcomed the agreement and its goals, but it has angered some farmers. The move comes just months after farmers held protests across Europe, blocking roads with tractors and pelting the European Parliament with eggs over a long list of complaints, including gripes about environmental regulation and excessive red tape. The global food system is a huge contributor to the climate crisis, producing around a third of greenhouse gas emissions. Livestock farming has a particularly big impact, accounting for around 12% of global emissions in 2015, according to the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization. A share of this pollution comes from methane, a potent planet-warming gas produced by cows and some other animals through their burps and manure. Reducing livestock emissions The tax, expected to be approved by Denmark\u2019s parliament later this year, will amount to 300 krone ($43) per tonne (1.1 ton) of CO2-equivalent emissions from livestock from 2030, rising to 750 krone ($107) in 2035. A 60% tax break will apply, meaning that farmers will effectively be charged 120 krone ($17) per tonne of livestock emissions per year from 2030, rising to 300 krone ($43) in 2035. On average, Danish dairy cows, which account for much of the cattle population, emit 5.6 tonnes of CO2-equivalent per year, according to Concito, a green think tank in Denmark. Using the lower tax rate of 120 krone results in a charge of 672 krone per cow, or $96. With the tax break in place, that levy will rise to 1,680 krone per cow in 2035 ($241). In the first two years, the proceeds from the tax will be used to support the agricultural industry\u2019s green transition and then reassessed. \u201cThe whole purpose of the tax is to get the sector to look for solutions to reduce emissions,\u201d Concito\u2019s chief economist Torsten Hasforth told CNN. For example, farmers could change the feed they use. But Danish farmers\u2019 group B\u00e6redygtigt Landbrug said the measures amounted to a \u201cscary experiment.\u201d \u201cWe believe that the agreement is pure bureaucracy,\u201d chairman Peter Ki\u00e6r said in a statement. \u201cWe recognize that there is a climate problem\u2026 But we do not believe that this agreement will solve the problems, because it will put a spoke in the wheel of agriculture\u2019s green investments.\u201d Peder Tuborgh, the CEO of Arla Foods, Europe\u2019s largest dairy group, said the agreement was \u201cpositive\u201d but that farmers who \u201cgenuinely do everything they can to reduce emissions\u201d should not be subjected to a tax. \u201cIt is essential that the tax base for a (carbon) tax is solely based on emissions for which there are means to eliminate (them),\u201d he added in statement. Kristian Hundeboll, the CEO of DLG Group, one of Europe\u2019s biggest agricultural businesses and a cooperative owned by 25,000 Danish farmers, said it was \u201ccrucial for competitiveness\u201d for the tax to be \u201canchored\u201d in European Union legislation. \u201cNeither the climate, agriculture nor the ancillary industries benefit from Denmark acting unilaterally,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign.

{"id": "2024_06_26_economy_fed-stress-test-results", "text": "America\u2019s biggest banks are well positioned to survive a severe recession while continuing to lend to households and businesses, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday in its annual bank resilience test, commonly referred to as a stress test. However, banks could suffer higher losses, if a significant economic downturn were to hit now versus a year ago. As a result of the banking crisis that fueled the Great Recession, the Fed conducts stress tests to monitor and uncover potential signs of weaknesses in the financial system. The tests have taken on an extra layer of importance after the collapse of three US banks sent shockwaves through the banking system last year. The 31 banks required to take the test would lose $685 billion. That\u2019s an increase of $144 billion compared to last year\u2019s stress test results. However, fewer banks were tested last year. Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr attributed the higher collective losses to the fact that banks have taken on more risk while incurring higher expenses. The higher interest rate environment we\u2019re currently in has made it riskier, and more costly, for banks to make loans, which can depress their profitability. One area that weighed on banks more compared to last year is credit card debt, which recently hit a record high. Additionally, a higher percentage of people are making late payments. Both resulted in higher projected credit card losses. At the same time, banks\u2019 income from fees was lower, giving them less of a buffer to absorb those losses. \u201cThe goal of our test is to help to ensure that banks have enough capital to absorb losses in a highly stressful scenario. This test shows that they do,\u201d Barr said. How individual banks fared While all banks passed the tests, their performance varied significantly under the severe recession scenario. After the Fed\u2019s stress test results were released, JPMorgan Chase disclosed late Wednesday that its losses would likely be \u201cmodestly higher\u201d than the Fed had estimated. However, the nation\u2019s largest bank declined to specify how much higher the losses would be, when CNN inquired. Overall, the bank performed well in the stress test with an expected loan loss rate of 6.3%, which is below the 7.1% average across all 31 banks. Discover Financial Services suffered the biggest loan loss rate of 18.7%, followed by Capital One\u2019s 16.5% loan loss rate. Earlier this year, Capital One (COF) announced plans to acquire Discover (DFS). The acquisition hasn\u2019t been finalized and is subject to approval by the Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which are set to hold a joint meeting about the proposed acquisition next month. Discover\u2019s and Capital One\u2019s performance in the stress tests will likely cause regulators to scrutinize their financials even more closely, at a minimum. Shares of both companies were down by over 2% Thursday morning. In contrast, Charles Schwab (SCHW) suffered the smallest loan loss rate of 1.3%. Its stock moved slightly higher after the stress test results.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/economy/fed-stress-test-results/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

The number of Americans receiving jobless benefits for multiple weeks climbed to its highest level since November 2021, according to a Department of Labor report released Thursday. The latest data is an indication that unemployed Americans may be having more trouble in landing work: The number of continuing claims, which are filed by people who have received unemployment benefits for at least one week or more, increased to 1.839 million from 1.821 million for the week ended June 15. However, there was a slight drop in the number of people filing for unemployment for the first time: There were 233,000 initial claims made during the week ended June 22, a decline of 6,000 from the prior week\u2019s upwardly revised level of 239,000. While the number of initial claims remains near pre-pandemic levels (but well below historical averages), they\u2019ve moved higher in recent weeks. The four-week average of 236,000 claims is the highest since early September of last year. Weekly jobless claims data, which is looked at as a proxy for layoff activity, can be highly volatile and is frequently revised. Still, the trend as of late has been an upward one, economist Ian Shepherdson wrote in a note to clients Thursday. Some leading indicators \u2014 such as Challenger, Gray & Christmas\u2019 monthly job cuts reports and federally and state-required mass layoff notices \u2014 imply that initial claims should continue to rise through the summer, wrote Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cThough the data often bounce around in July with the timing of auto plant shutdowns,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNo one indicator points to a huge jump in claims, but bear in mind that struggling firms usually prefer to reduce employment initially by cutting hiring, instead of laying off staff, and most hiring indicators also point to an imminent deterioration.\u201d The hiring and firing indicators point to a significant slowing in job growth (possibly sub-100,0000) during the next three months, he said. Such a trajectory \u201cwould give a further boost to the unemployment rate and leave the [Federal Reserve] looking seriously behind the curve,\u201d he said. The Fed has kept interest rates at a 23-year high as it waits for inflation to slow meaningfully. The labor market has done its part in keeping people employed, fueling consumer spending and pushing off any fears of a recession. Job gains have slowed from their blockbuster pace of recent years; but the unemployment rate in May did pop higher to 4% after staying below that threshold for 27 months, and the number of job openings recently fell to a three-year low. Consumer spending, the main driver for US economic growth, slowed down in the first three months of the year, according to the final read on first-quarter GDP released Thursday morning.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/economy/us-unemployment-claims/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

CoolApp, launched this month to rival WhatsApp and Telegram, will make it \u201cdifficult for foreigners to interfere with our information,\u201d the former prime minister wrote in a post on his official Facebook page this week, adding that he was mindful of \u201cnational security.\u201d \u201cIt is the first-ever Cambodian program and used within the Cambodian security domain,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOther countries have their own social media means of communication like China\u2019s WeChat, Vietnam\u2019s Zalo, South Korea\u2019s Kakao Talk and Russia\u2019s Telegram, so in Cambodia, we have \u2026 our own product,\u201d he added. One of the world\u2019s longest-serving leaders, Hun Sen has ruled Cambodia with an iron fist for more than three decades. Though his eldest son, Hun Manet, succeeded him as prime minister last year, Hun Sen remains the ruling party\u2019s center of power. The country has been at the center of a multi-billion dollar online scam epidemic in Southeast Asia, run predominantly by Chinese gangs, which has raised global security concerns from bodies like the US State Department and the United Nations. CoolApp founder and CEO Lim Cheavutha told CNN the app has been downloaded 150,000 times and does not monitor, collect or store user data. It uses end-to-end encryption to ensure data and calls remain secure, he said. \u201cOnly you and the person you are communicating with can read or listen (to messages and calls) \u2014 nobody in between,\u201d he said. He predicted the app will eventually reach 500,000 or 1 million downloads, though he did not provide a timeframe. Meta\u2019s WhatsApp, the world\u2019s most popular messaging app, is estimated to have millions of users in Cambodia. Greater online surveillance Internet freedom in Cambodia has experienced a drastic regression under Hun Sen\u2019s rule, rights groups say. Censorship, media blackouts and online harassment are rampant. Activists have noted increased state surveillance, which has led to the arrest and persecution of government critics over the years as well as the shutdown of independent media outlets and websites. CNN has reached out to Hun Sen\u2019s office for comment. A prolific social media user who once famously denied buying likes for his Facebook page, Hun Sen has considered banning the site, the most popular social media platform in the country, saying he was fed up about online abuse from political opponents abroad. In 2023, a quasi-independent oversight board for Facebook\u2019s parent company Meta (META) recommended that Hun Sen\u2019s Facebook and Instagram accounts be suspended for six months for using language that could incite violence, according to Reuters. Mu Sochua, an opposition leader living in exile overseas, told CNN that Cambodians \u201cshould not be fooled by the strongman leader\u2019s promotion of CoolApp.\u201d \u201cI see it as nothing but another violent assault on civil liberties in Cambodia,\u201d she said, calling the app a \u201cChinese-style mechanism for the control of public discourse and mass surveillance.\u201d Hun Sen and the Cambodian government have close ties with China\u2019s ruling Communist Party, which oversees a massive surveillance network. \u201cAlready civil servants are ordered to download CoolApp,\u201d Mu Sochua said. \u201cWho dares to oppose the order?\u201d Another exiled Cambodian opposition leader, Sam Rainsy, echoed calls to boycott CoolApp, saying the app would \u201cstrengthen repressive tools at the disposal of the regime.\u201d \u201cThis is ironic coming from a leader who has a long history and track record of secretly listening in to private opposition discussions,\u201d Sam Rainsy said, noting previous instances of Hun Sen controlling social media discourse.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/tech/cambodia-coolapp-messaging-surveillance-fears-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_business_boeing-whistleblower-787", "text": "A whistleblower has come forward Wednesday alleging parts of Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner planes were built in an unsafe manner \u2013 potentially leading to \u201cdevastating consequences.\u201d Richard Cuevas, a mechanic at Strom, a contractor for Boeing manufacturing partner Spirit Aerosystems, claims that he witnessed holes that were improperly drilled into the forward pressure bulkheads of 787 planes at Spirit\u2019s Wichita, Kansas, facility in 2023. The bulkhead is one of the primary parts of an airplane\u2019s body and crucial for keeping the structure of the plane intact while it\u2019s in the air. Cuevas claims that he filed a complaint in October 2023 to Boeing and Spirit about \u201csubstandard manufacturing and maintenance processes\u201d he witnessed, and was fired just a few months later, according to the complaints filed by his attorneys and obtained by CNN. Boeing said it had previously investigated Cuevas\u2019 allegations and they did not pose a safety problem. \u201cA subcontractor\u2019s employee previously reported concerns to us that we thoroughly investigated as we take seriously any safety-related matter,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cEngineering analysis determined that the issues raised did\u00a0not\u00a0present a safety concern and were addressed.\u201d The company said it is reviewing the documents Cuevas\u2019 attorneys made public Wednesday and will investigate any new claims. Spirit Aerosystems and Strom did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that they \u201cstrongly encourage anyone with safety concerns to report them and we thoroughly investigate every report.\u201d The FAA said it has revieved 126 Boeing whistleblower reports this year and 11 last year. Cuevas said the gaps he observed in the plane\u2019s forward pressure bulkheads appeared in two aircraft that he helped build and could potentially lead to \u201ccatastrophe.\u201d Cuevas claims the workers were drilling holes slightly larger than Boeing\u2019s specifications to \u201cclear excess paint from the holes and speed up a slow process,\u201d which, he believes, could compromise power and air pressure on the planes, creating serious safety risk for the passengers on board. Cuevas said he filed a complaint with Boeing\u2019s ethics hotline, reporting to management that he believed Spirit was hiding the issues from Boeing. He also alleges that Boeing opened an investigation into Cuevas\u2019 concerns in October 2023, alerting Spirit management to the complaints. During that time, Cuevas says his colleague remarked, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a snitch among us,\u201d and in March, Spirit suddenly fired Cuevas, according to the complaints. The complaints say Cuevas witnessed these problems with three planes he worked on and believes these issues may affect at least 10 to 12 planes either in production or already released to Boeing. A growing list of problems for Boeing The claims aren\u2019t new: A previous whistleblower, Sam Salehpour, a Boeing engineer, said he found and reported similar gaps in 787 and 777 aircraft. For nearly two years starting in 2021, the FAA and Boeing\u00a0halted deliveries of the new Dreamliners\u00a0while it looked into the gaps.\u00a0Boeing said it made changes in its manufacturing process, and deliveries ultimately resumed. More than a dozen whistleblowers have come forward against Boeing in recent years, and the number has grown substantially since a door plug blew off a 737 Max plane in January just after takeoff, leaving a gaping hole in the side the plane. Last week, for example, a current Boeing employee claimed that the company tried to shield broken or out-of-specification 737 Max plane parts from regulators and lost track of them \u2013 and he feared they may have been installed on planes that are carrying passengers. The FAA has opened multiple investigations into Boeing and the US Department of Justice said it may file criminal charges against the company because of its ongoing quality and safety failures. The FAA has said a six-week audit of Boeing\u2019s facilities conducted in the late winter found multiple problems with Boeing\u2019s production practices. A separate\u00a0report\u00a0found \u201cgaps\u201d in Boeing\u2019s safety culture, including a disconnect between management and employees, and fears among employees about retaliation for reporting safety concerns. Boeing\u2019s CEO Dave Calhoun last week apologized for Boeing\u2019s recent safety failures in testimony delivered to a Senate committee but pushed back on claims that the company retaliated against those who brought safety issues to light. Calhoun said Boeing is \u201cfar from perfect,\u201d and he acknowledged that the company will not easily regain the public\u2019s trust.

Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT.

{"id": "2024_06_27_economy_housing-market-prices-inflation", "text": "Help may not be on the way for first-time homebuyers frustrated by high mortgage rates and even higher home prices. Economists at Bank of America warned this week that the US housing market is \u201cstuck and we are not convinced it will become unstuck\u201d until 2026 \u2014 or later. The bank said home prices will stay high and go even higher. The housing shortage will persist. And mortgage rates may not fall much \u2014 even if the Federal Reserve finally delivers long-delayed interest rate cuts. \u201cThis will take many years to work itself out. There isn\u2019t a magic fix,\u201d Michael Gapen, head of US economics at Bank of America, told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cThe message for first-time homebuyers is one of patience and frustration.\u201d Housing affordability is a major problem in America. Home prices spiked during Covid-19 and then the Fed\u2019s war on inflation sent mortgage rates surging. The one-two punch has made it a historically unaffordable time to buy a home. \u201cIt\u2019s been a weird combination. Mortgage rates rose substantially but so did home prices. That typically doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d said Gapen. The supply of homes simply cannot keep up with demand. Prices have had nowhere to go but up. The median price of a previously owned US home climbed in May for the 11th month in a row to a record $419,300 \u2014 up 6% from a year earlier. Bank of America expects home prices will climb by 4.5% this year and then by another 5% in 2025 before eventually dipping by 0.5% in 2026. \u2018Lock-in effect\u2019 could persist for eight years One major problem hurting supply is the \u201clock-in effect.\u201d People who already own their home are effectively locked into their property after refinancing or getting a mortgage during the pandemic when ultra-low rates were available. Buying now at current rates would require them to pay hundreds of dollars more per month on interest alone. Plus, home prices have gone up. For many, it just doesn\u2019t make sense to move. And because those homeowners are not moving, the supply of existing homes on the market is limited. \u201cWhy would I sell unless I have to?\u201d said Gapen. \u201cPrices have gone up and the mortgage rate is a lot higher. So, I\u2019m content to stay where I am.\u201d Bank of America warns the lock-in effect could persist for another six to eight years, keeping a lid on supply during that time. That\u2019s because the mortgage rate of people who already own is historically low. And the rate for new buyers is elevated. Bank of America doesn\u2019t think that gap will shrink much for years. This problem helps explain why pending home sales fell in May to a record low, according to data released on Thursday. Pending sales, tracked by the National Association of Realtors since 2001, are a forward-looking gauge of home sales that measures contract signings. \u2018They can\u2019t take their mortgage rate with them\u2019 Dave Liniger, who co-founded real estate giant RE/MAX with his wife in 1973, said the lock-in effect means people who want to size up to a bigger home can\u2019t, and the next generation can\u2019t even get their foot in the door for a starter property. \u201cThe move-up market does not exist,\u201d Liniger told CNN. \u201cStarter homes have doubled in value and the owners would like to move up but the problem is they can\u2019t take their mortgage rate with them.\u201d Liniger agrees that the housing market is stuck, for now at least. \u201cWe have to muddle our way through this for a period of time,\u201d he said. But Liniger urged first-time homebuyers to remain patient. \u201cDon\u2019t give up the dream,\u201d he said. In theory, a flood of supply of new homes would help unstick the market. However, Bank of America expects housing starts \u2014 which is a measure of newly constructed homes \u2014 to remain flat for the coming years. And housing starts have still not recovered from the bursting of the housing bubble in the mid-2000s. Divide between haves and have-nots The forecast for a \u201cstuck\u201d housing market cuts both ways. The spike in home prices has padded the net worth of existing homeowners and given them additional financial flexibility. But there are many Americans who are on the outside looking in. They\u2019d like to buy but can\u2019t afford to at these prices and these mortgage rates. The longer they are prevented from buying, the more time they miss out on wealth creation. In a recent Gallup poll, just 21% of Americans said it is a good time to buy a house, tied for the worst reading in Gallup history. An overwhelming majority \u2014 76% \u2014 say it\u2019s a bad time to buy. Gapen, the Bank of America economist, said if the US economy achieves the soft landing that he expects, meaning that inflation cools without triggering a recession, there is a risk that home prices will rise even more than anticipated. On the other hand, if the durability of the recovery has been overestimated and a recession is on the way, home prices could tumble and affordability would ease. \u201cBut, obviously, you don\u2019t want to go through a recession to have better housing affordability,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/economy/housing-market-prices-inflation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Nvidia, Nvidia, Nvidia. The $3 trillion tech darling has seduced investors, and its stock has risen about 750% since the beginning of 2023. But the past few days suggest that the spell the company cast over Wall Street has broken as a sudden wave of volatility briefly sent shares of the company skidding lower. Nvidia\u2019s stock bounced back Tuesday, yet investors have been reminded of a potentially bubble-bursting truth: You can fly too close to the sun. What\u2019s happening: Nvidia has had a whiplash-inducing few months. The chipmaker added a trillion dollars to its market cap, growing to $3 trillion in just 30 days from April 2024. For context, it took Warren Buffett about 60 years to build Berkshire Hathaway into a nearly trillion dollar company. On June 18, Nvidia\u2019s market value soared to $3.34 trillion, surpassing Microsoft\u2019s to become the world\u2019s most valuable company, and the stock seemed to be speeding up a one-way road to the top. Why it matters: Nvidia is solely responsible for about 35% of the S&P 500\u2019s total gains this year, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank. That makes it one of the most influential companies ever listed on the S&P 500. That\u2019s why Nvidia\u2019s plunge last week and on Monday was so jarring to investors. The stock shed a whopping $430 billion in value over the course of just three days. \u201cFirst it was the Magnificent Seven. Then it was the Fab Four. Now, a single stock is driving most of the gains in the S&P 500,\u201d said Jim Smigiel, chief investor officer at SEI. Nvidia has been like a habit investors have been unable to shake. \u201cOne question I get a lot is \u2018why don\u2019t I just put all my money in Nvidia.\u2019\u00a0I cannot really argue with that question,\u201d wrote Louis Navellier of Navellier & Associates in a recent note to investors. Then came the drop. \u201cWhat we see with Nvidia is typical volatility, which is expected when a stock rises as quickly as Nvidia\u2019s did,\u201d Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at trading platform CMC Markets, told CNN on Tuesday. But typical volatility can have seismic repercussions when it comes to a stock as all-consuming as Nvidia. Emerging from the cave: The stock was the second best performer in the entire S&P 500 Tuesday, gaining nearly 7%. That pushed its market cap back above the $3 trillion mark again. Still, the damage may already be done. \u201cNvidia\u2019s rich valuation is ludicrous \u2014 its market cap now exceeds that of the entire FTSE 100, yet its sales are less than 4% of that index,\u201d said Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO and founding partner of Bowersock Capital Partners, with reference to the 100 biggest stocks listed in London. Analysts at The Carlyle Group say that while artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the world around us, the Nvidia stock bubble will eventually burst. \u201cThe market seems quite adept at identifying transformational change but gets fixated on the hardware that facilitates it rather than the downstream value that hardware ultimately unlocks,\u201d wrote Jason Thomas, Carlyle\u2019s head of global research and investment strategy in a recent note. Yes, but: Still, enthusiasm remains high. \u201cThe fundamentals behind Nvidia\u2019s growth remain the same,\u201d Neil Roarty, analyst at investment platform Stocklytics wrote on Tuesday. \u201cIf you believe that the AI technology its chips are powering will completely recalibrate the global economy \u2014 and many do \u2014 then a $3 trillion market cap suddenly looks considerably more reasonable.\u201d The stock is up another 2.3% in premarket trading Wednesday. Levi\u2019s under fire after supplier laid off hundreds of workers Levi\u2019s is a global brand that\u00a0says\u00a0it has always stood up for \u201cwhat\u2019s right.\u201d But its claim to be an ethical company is now in question following the release of a report from an independent labor monitoring group. Critics accuse Levi\u2019s (LEVI) of ignoring its own labor standards after it continued working with a factory in Turkey that fired around 400 people last year after they joined a union and went on strike over pay and working conditions. Turkey is a critical link in the global supply chain for apparel. The country exported around $30 billion worth of apparel and textiles last year, according to the Istanbul Exporters\u2019 Association, a clothing industry group. In a statement to CNN, Levi\u2019s said it had \u201ca\u00a0longstanding commitment to supporting safe, productive workplaces for workers, and we take any allegations of efforts to curtail freedom of association extremely seriously.\u201d It said it continued sourcing jeans from the factory despite the mass firings, to avoid further job losses, but the continuation of its relationship with the supplier depends \u201con management\u2019s fulfillment of a detailed remediation plan that addresses freedom of association, working hours, and health and safety.\u201d Read more here.  \u2018Months to correct, if not years\u2019: Car dealerships and customers feel the impact as CDK outage drags on A CDK Global system outage has affected nearly every aspect of the Mazda dealership in Seekonk, Massachusetts, where Ryan Callahan is general sales manager. He says it won\u2019t be a simple fix. \u201cThe financial impact it will directly have on us will take months to correct, if not years,\u201d Callahan said. Car buyers and dealers are grappling with the shutdown of the retail software provider, which has left nearly 15,000 car dealerships across North America struggling to provide services to customers and scrambling to find temporary analog solutions to operate. CDK says it\u2019s working on restoring its systems and expects them to be back online in several days, but in the interim, customers and dealership employees remain beset by long wait times, delays \u2014 and missed chances to make or save money. Tom McParland, the owner of Automatic Consulting, a national car buying service, said the outage was impacting customers because they have fewer dealers to choose from. \u201cIt reduces their ability to get a deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt limits the customer\u2019s leverage.\u201d Read more here.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_food_hooters-closures", "text": "Hooters is the latest chain to close dozens of locations across the United States, blaming tough economic challenges including rising food and labor costs. \u201cLike many restaurants under pressure from current market conditions, Hooters has made the difficult decision to close a select number of underperforming stores,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. The company did not release a list of affected locations or specific number. However, according to local reports, several dozen locations of the wing chain have closed, spanning several states including Florida, Kentucky, Rhode Island, Texas and Virginia. Some of those closed over the weekend, with others shuttering in the past few weeks. Despite the closures, Hooters said the 41-year-old brand \u201cremains highly resilient and relevant,\u201d pointing toward its new lineup of frozen food sold at grocery stores and new restaurant openings overseas. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to serve our guests at home, on the go and at our restaurants here in the US and around the globe,\u201d the company said. Accounting for the closures, Hooters has about 300 global locations \u2014 a nearly 12% decline since 2018, per Technomic, a restaurant consulting firm. In comparison, rivals like Twin Peaks and Dave & Busters have all grown since then. Menu prices rose 0.4% at sit-down restaurants from April to May, adjusted for seasonal swings, according to\u00a0inflation data\u00a0released this month by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In that time prices ticked up 0.2% at limited service spots, which include fast casual and fast food joints. The increases, particularly in fast food prices, have caused customers to\u00a0pull back on spending\u00a0and\u00a0complain online, eroding the sector\u2019s reputation for affordability.

{"id": "2024_06_23_cars_eu-china-ev-import-tariffs-talks-intl-hnk", "text": "China\u00a0and the\u00a0European Union have agreed to start talks on the planned imposition of tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) being imported into the\u00a0European market, senior officials of both sides said on Saturday. Germany\u2019s Economy Minister Robert Habeck said he had been informed by\u00a0EU\u00a0Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis that there would be concrete negotiations on tariffs with\u00a0China. The confirmation came after\u00a0China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said its head Wang Wentao, and Dombrovskis, executive vice president of the\u00a0European Commission, had agreed to start consultations over the\u00a0EU\u2019s anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs. \u201cThis is new and surprising in that it has not been possible to enter into a concrete negotiation timetable in the last few weeks,\u201d Habeck said in Shanghai. He said it was a first step and many more will be necessary. \u201cWe are far from the end, but at least, it is a first step that was not possible before.\u201d The minister had said earlier on Saturday that the\u00a0European Union\u2019s door was open for discussions regarding\u00a0EU\u00a0tariffs\u00a0on Chinese exports. \u201cWhat I suggested to my Chinese partners today is that the doors are open for discussions and I hope that this message was heard,\u201d he said in his first statement in Shanghai, after meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing. Habeck\u2019s visit is the first by a senior\u00a0European official since Brussels proposed hefty duties on imports of Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) to combat what the\u00a0EU\u00a0considers excessive subsidies. Habeck said there is time for a dialog between the\u00a0EU\u00a0and\u00a0China\u00a0on tariff issues before the duties come into full effect in November and that he believes in open markets but that markets require a level playing field. Proven subsidies that are intended to increase the export advantages of companies can\u2019t be accepted, the minister said. Another point of tension between Beijing and Berlin is\u00a0China\u2019s support for Russia in its war in Ukraine. Habeck noted Chinese trade with Russia increased more than 40% last year. Habeck said he had told Chinese officials that this was taking a toll on their economic relationship. \u201cCircumventions of the sanctions imposed on Russia are not acceptable,\u201d he said, adding that technical goods produced in\u00a0Europe should not end up on the battlefield via other countries. Not a \u2018punishment\u2019 The\u00a0EU\u2019s provisional duties of up to 38.1% on imported Chinese EVs are set to apply by July 4, with the investigation set to continue until November 2, when definitive duties, typically for five years, could be imposed. \u201cThis opens a phase where negotiations are possible, discussions are important and dialog is needed,\u201d Habeck said. Proposed\u00a0EU\u00a0tariffs on Chinese goods are not a \u201cpunishment,\u201d Habeck told Chinese officials earlier in Beijing. \u201cIt is important to understand that these are not punitive tariffs,\u201d he said in the first plenary session of a climate and transformation dialog. Countries such as the United States, Brazil and Turkey had used punitive tariffs, but not the\u00a0EU, he said. \u201cEurope does things differently.\u201d Habeck said the\u00a0European Commission had for nine months examined in detail whether Chinese companies had benefited unfairly from subsidies. Any countervailing duty measure that results from the\u00a0EU\u00a0review \u201cis not a punishment,\u201d he said, adding that such measures were meant to compensate for the advantages granted to Chinese companies by Beijing. Zheng Shanjie, chairman of\u00a0China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission, responded: \u201cWe will do everything to protect Chinese companies.\u201d Proposed\u00a0EU\u00a0duties on Chinese-made EVs would hurt both sides, Zheng added. He told Habeck he hoped Germany would demonstrate leadership within the\u00a0EU\u00a0and \u201cdo the correct thing.\u201d He also denied accusations of unfair subsidies, saying the development of\u00a0China\u2019s new energy industry was the result of comprehensive advantages in technology, market and industry supply chains, fostered in fierce competition. The industry\u2019s growth \u201cis the result of competition, rather than subsidies, let alone unfair competition,\u201d Zheng said during the meeting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/cars/eu-china-ev-import-tariffs-talks-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/28/2024", "section": "business"}}
