{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_investing_dow-40000", "text": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average broke past the 40,000 threshold Thursday for the first time ever, fueled by an encouraging inflation report. The blue-chip index briefly crossed the key threshold in morning trading before falling back below the line in the afternoon to close at 39,869, down 38 points, or 0.1%. All three major indexes closed lower on Thursday. The S&P 500 ended the day down 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.3% lower. Markets had rallied to new record highs Wednesday after the latest Consumer Price Index showed a cooldown for the first time in months, stoking hopes that the Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates as soon as September. On a monthly basis, the inflation report showed that prices rose 0.3%, a slower pace than in the two months prior, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists were expecting a 0.4% monthly increase, according to FactSet consensus estimates. Another key data point added to the enthusiasm: April retail sales came in significantly weaker than expected, indicating that consumers are pulling back on the spending that drives the economy. Spending missed the 0.4% increase that economists had projected. \u201cThis is the first good CPI report in four months and the market likes it,\u201d said Gary Pzegeo, head of fixed income at CIBC Private Wealth US. \u201cTaken [together with retail sales] this supports a Fed rate cut in the fall.\u00a0Markets are discounting a cut in September and have moved to price in a second cut by December.\u201d President Joe Biden celebrated the move Thursday. \u201cThis is great news for Americans\u2019 retirement accounts and another sign of confidence in America\u2019s economy,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cI\u2019m building an economy from the middle out and bottom up \u2014 and our investments are making a difference.\u201d Main Street vs. Wall Street The new record for the Dow, made of 30 blue-chip stocks, marks a symbolic shift for investors who \u2014 despite elevated interest and inflation rates, geopolitical strife and years of recession warnings \u2014 still feel good about the US economy. It also highlights a notable contrast between sentiment on Wall Street and Main Street. Consumer sentiment plunged to the lowest level in six months as price increases reaccelerated, according to a University of Michigan survey of consumers released earlier this month. The recent inflation crisis has given Americans angst about the economy, and recent CNN polls show that many people believe the US economy is headed in the wrong direction. Some even believe the United States is currently in a recession, although there\u2019s no evidence of that. Overall, 26% of Americans currently say that economic conditions have stabilized, according to CNN data from February. Nearly half of Americans say they believe the economy remains in a downturn. The first three months of 2024 brought remarkable market momentum. The S&P 500 hit 22 new records between January 1 and April. But, since then, markets have become volatile, as investors began to fear that inflation and interest rates would remain higher for longer. Wednesday\u2019s CPI report changed that perception. \u201cThis was a good report in the context of three hotter-than-expected [CPI] reports, and it makes it look like potentially those were bumps in the road rather than a really stagnant inflation environment,\u201d Tyler Schipper, economics professor at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota, told CNN in an interview. Crossing 40,000 Crossing the 40,000 level doesn\u2019t hold much practical value for investors, but it does catch the attention of the public and, some argue, it could help propel that optimistic sentiment beyond Wall Street. \u201cThe Dow 40,000 milestone also shows how resilient the US economy has been, at a time where there was a plethora of calls for a recession,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial, in a recent note to CNN. \u201cThe overarching importance of crossing these big round numbers is that it brings Wall Street news to Main Street, at least for a day. It also serves as an affirmation that corporate earnings are growing, and that investor confidence remains robust,\u201d he said. To many Americans, \u201cthe Dow\u201d simply means the stock market. The index\u2019s small cache of stocks \u2014 ranging from Microsoft to McDonald\u2019s to Chevron \u2014 represents some of the largest companies in the nation and are widely held among retail and institutional investors alike. A look back Here are some important stops along the Dow\u2019s road to 40,000: Dow is formed: The first daily close, on May 26, 1896, was 40.94. The Dow did not get off to a good start, plunging 30% to an all-time low of 28.48 by August that year. Dow 100: The Dow first closed in triple digits in January 1906. That marked an impressive rally for the average, which had hit an all-time low when Teddy Roosevelt was president. The Federal Reserve would not be created for seven more years. Crash of 1929: The Dow fell 38 points on Oct. 28 and 31 more points the next day. That might not sound bad today, but it represented back-to-back declines of 13% and 12% of the Dow\u2019s value. They are still two of the worst one-day percentage declines in the index\u2019s history. Dow 1,000: Nov. 14, 1972. Richard Nixon had just won reelection by taking 49 states. The Dow\u2019s components, which had been unchanged for 13 years, included Woolworth, Eastman Kodak and International Nickel. Crash of 1987: On Oct. 19, the Dow plunged 508 points, a 23% drop that is still the largest one-day percentage decline in history. A week later it took an 8% plunge. But the damage was short-lived: Within a year, the Dow was back to pre-crash levels. Dow 10,000: March 29, 1999. The \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d of the tech bubble was in full swing as the Dow gained 1,000 points in less than a year to hit this benchmark. It gained 1,000 more points in just the next month. A year later, the dot-com stock bubble burst, sending the Dow down nearly 30% by September 2001. Meltdown of 2008-2009: The financial crisis caused the Dow to lose about half its value in less than a year, bottoming out to close at 6,547 on March 9, 2009. The worst day was Sept. 29, 2008, when the Dow lost what was then a record 778 points after Congress rejected a $700 billion bank bailout. The bailout was later approved. Dow 15,000: May 7, 2013. As the economy continued to recover from the Great Recession, the Dow had one of the current bull market\u2019s strongest periods. It crossed the 15,000 mark and finished the year up 26.5%, marking the best full-year performance of the current bull market. The Dow nearly matched that in 2017, rising 25%. Dow 20,000: January 25, 2017. The stock market had enjoyed a nice run starting on the day after the 2016 election, with the Dow gaining nearly 10% as investors looked forward to lower taxes and less regulation under the Trump administration. Dow 25,000: Jan. 4, 2018. The passage of the Trump tax cuts, especially the lowering of the corporate tax rate in December 2017, helped feed the quick move between 20,000 and 25,000. Dow 30,000: Nov. 24, 2020: Covid sent the stock market plunging in the spring of 2020. But new hopes of a vaccine and the results of the presidential election ended an era of uncertainty on Wall Street, sending the stock market rolling once again.

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens.

To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_business_trump-trade-war-tariffs-china", "text": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s trade agenda amounts to a tripling-down of the trade war he waged during his first term in office. Not only has Trump called for a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee has said he would impose a tariff of at least a 10% on all $3 trillion worth of US imports. While Trump has championed aggressive tariffs as a way to protect working-class Americans, new research suggests they would do the opposite. Trump\u2019s unprecedented trade proposals would inflict \u201csignificant collateral damage on the US economy,\u201d costing consumers at least $500 billion a year, or 1.8% of gross domestic product (GDP), according to a paper published Monday by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. That\u2019s nearly five times the total cost as a share of GDP from the 2018-2019 US-China trade war. Trump\u2019s tariff proposals would cost the typical middle-income household at least $1,700 a year, the researchers found. \u201cThese policies are more likely to hurt than help the lower- and middle-income Americans they purport to benefit,\u201d authors Kimberly Clausing and Mary Lovely, senior fellows at the Peterson Institute, wrote in the paper, titled \u201cWhy Trump\u2019s Tariff Proposals Would Harm Working Americans.\u201d The paper stresses that the $1,700 hit to the typical family is just the minimum impact, as the estimate does not include damage from foreign retaliation, slower economic growth and lost competitiveness. The authors warn the actual impact could be twice as high. \u201cThis is the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Clausing, chair in tax law and policy at the UCLA School of Law, told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cThe cost of retaliation will be very large. The Europeans will tariff us. The Mexicans and Canadians will be very upset. People aren\u2019t going to take it lying down.\u201d Biden ramps up tariffs, too Of course, Trump is hardly alone in embracing tariffs. President Joe Biden largely kept in place the Trump-era tariffs \u2013 even though he criticized them in the lead-up to the 2020 election. \u201cDespite having ample opportunity,\u201d the authors wrote, Biden has \u201cfailed to remove\u201d the China tariffs that \u201ccontinue to harm American households, although to a far smaller degree than Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs would do.\u201d Biden hasn\u2019t just kept the Trump tariffs in place. He has added to them, albeit in a much more targeted way. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, in remarks she delivered Tuesday morning in Frankfurt, Germany, called on Europe to join the United States in its effort to fight back against a flood of cheap Chinese goods entering the global marketplace. \u201cIndustrial overcapacity not only poses a threat to firms in the U.S. and Europe. It could also prevent countries around the world, including emerging markets, from building the industries that could power their growth,\u201d Yellen said. \u201cIf we do not respond strategically and in a united way, the viability of businesses in both our countries and around the world could be at risk.\u201d Last week Biden announced increased tariffs on $18 billion worth of Chinese goods, including steel, aluminum, computer chips, electric vehicles and solar cells. Clausing, a former Biden official at the Treasury Department, told CNN that a rough estimate suggests these targeted Biden tariffs will cost the typical family approximately $30 a year. \u201cEighteen billion dollars is incredibly small relative to $3 trillion. Those aren\u2019t comparable numbers,\u201d Clausing said, referring to the amount of imports targeted by Biden and by Trump tariffs. Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign\u2019s national press secretary, said in response to the research that Trump negotiated better trade deals during his first term that boosted the US economy. \u201cThe American people don\u2019t need \u2018papers\u2019 from alleged \u2018experts\u2019 to know Bidenomics has robbed them of thousands of hard-earned dollars, and they will have more money back in their pockets with President Trump back in the White House,\u201d Leavitt said in a statement to CNN. Leavitt argued that \u201cout of control spending created the worst inflation crisis in generations\u201d during the Biden administration. \u201cWhen President Trump is back, he will reimplement his America First, pro-growth, pro-job agenda and cut good trade deals that uplift the American worker and family,\u201d she said. Trade war damage To be sure, Trump has legitimate gripes with China on trade. Many Democrats and CEOs share concerns about China\u2019s trade practices, including alleged theft of trade secrets, \u201cdumping\u201d goods at artificially cheap prices and other moves that make it difficult to compete on a level playing field. However, some economists have expressed alarm at the massive tariff proposals from Trump, who famously labeled himself \u201cTariff Man\u201d in 2018. Moody\u2019s recently estimated that even if Trump cushioned the blow from tariffs with tax cuts, his trade proposals would cost the US economy 675,000 jobs, worsen inflation and shrink GDP by 0.6 percentage points. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s, told CNN last month that the US economy would likely plunge into a recession when factoring in retaliation from other nations. The Peterson Institute research found that even the high end of projections for revenue generated would fall \u201cfar short\u201d of what would be needed to pay for an extension of Trump\u2019s tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of 2025. It would cost approximately $4.6 trillion if the Trump tax cuts are extended for the next decade, according to a recent Congressional Budget Office report. The benefits from expanding the Trump tax cuts would go \u201cdisproportionately to the top end of the income distribution,\u201d the Peterson Institute researchers found. Bigger picture, the risk of a broader global trade fight could also impact international affairs. The Peterson Institute authors argued the trade tensions would make it harder for nations to collaborate on other critical issues such as climate change, public health emergencies, security and nuclear proliferation. \u201cIn short, the proposed policies come with serious national security risks,\u201d they wrote. Who pays for tariffs? The Peterson Institute trade analysis assumes that tariffs are \u201cfully passed on to US buyers\u201d \u2013 a finding disputed by Trump, who has repeatedly suggested that other nations are paying for US tariffs. However, many experts say US consumers and businesses pay the cost of the tariffs. \u201cThe 2018-2019 tariffs clearly raised consumer prices,\u201d Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a recent report to clients, adding that these price increases were \u201cborne almost entirely by US businesses and households\u201d \u2013 not Chinese exporters. Likewise, the US International Trade Commission found in a 2023 study that US importers \u201cbore nearly the full cost\u201d of tariffs. That independent agency estimated that prices increased by about 1% for each 1% increase in tariffs on Chinese-made goods, steel and aluminum. \u201cIn contrast to Trump\u2019s frequent, and mistaken, claims that foreigners bear the impact of tariffs, economists have long understood that tariffs burden domestic purchasers of imported goods,\u201d the Peterson Institute paper said. \u201cThe data show that higher tariffs are fully reflected in higher prices for US buyers.\u201d \u2018Arguably the most bipartisan issue\u2019 No matter who wins in November, tariffs are expected to remain in favor in Washington \u2013 especially on China. Both parties have embraced tariffs as a way to show they are tough on China, and there is little appetite to back down \u2013 even though economists say lower tariffs could help ease inflation. Policies that favor American factories are \u201carguably the most bipartisan issue in an increasingly partisan Washington,\u201d Chris Krueger, managing director of TD Cowen\u2019s Washington Research Group, wrote in a note to clients on Monday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/business/trump-trade-war-tariffs-china/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}

The VinFast VF8, made by the Vietnamese automaker founded in 2017, veered off the road and crashed into a pole and then a tree before catching fire, according to a complaint posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s web site. Someone claiming to be the vehicle\u2019s owner filed the complaint. The SUV was being driven by one of the owner\u2019s coworkers with the coworker\u2019s family when the fatal crash occurred, according to the complaint.

Earlier, while the owner was driving, the same vehicle had unexpectedly steered to the right, according to the complaint, in at least two instances. In at least one of those cases, the SUV\u2019s automatic driving assistance features, designed to automatically help the vehicle steer within its own lane, were turned on \u201cby default.\u201d The driver was able to regain control, bringing the vehicle back into the proper lane, according to the complaint. \u201cThe contact was concerned that the failure recurred while the coworker was driving,\u201d the complaint said.

{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_business_trump-media-quarterly-results", "text": "Trump Media & Technology Group lost more than $300 million during the first quarter and generated very little revenue, the owner of Truth Social announced in a press release Monday. The results will raise additional questions about the multi-billion dollar valuation on the newly public company, which is majority owned by former President Donald Trump. Trump Media (DJT) reported a loss of $327.6 million during the first three months of the year driven mostly by one-time losses linked to the deal that brought the company public earlier this year. The company lost $210,300 a year earlier. The company blamed the losses on non-cash expenses from the conversion of promissory notes and the elimination of previous liabilities. Trump Media reported an operating loss of $12.1 million, with a chunk of that being driven by one-time payments related to the closing of its merger with a blank-check company earlier this year. The company generated just $770,500 of revenue, marking the second-straight quarter where its revenue totaled less than $1 million. \u201cI can\u2019t emphasize enough how unusual it is for a company with this little revenue to have this high a valuation,\u201d Matthew Kennedy, senior IPO market strategist at Renaissance Capital, told CNN in an email. In the press release, Trump Media said that at this \u201cearly stage\u201d in its development, the company \u201cremains focused on long-term product development, rather than quarterly revenue.\u201d It acknowledged that its advertising business is just getting off the ground and expressed confidence that new products like streaming will boost its results in the future. \u201cBut if they\u2019re not focused on revenue, public investors have very little to go on. What metrics can we look at? How can investors determine if the company is on the right track?\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThe company does not provide user\u00a0metrics (though we could look at app downloads or Trump\u2019s followers). It requires a lot of trust, and for now, shareholders seem to be willing to extend an enormous amount of trust. That can quickly change, as we saw in early April.\u201d Trump Media said that it has \u201csufficient\u201d cash to fund the business \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201d The company listed a cash balance of $274 million as of the end of March \u2014 a sum boosted by its deal to go public. \u201cAfter an unprecedented, years-long process, we have consummated our merger and dispensed with the vast bulk of merger-related expenses, leaving the Company well-capitalized and supported by a legion of retail shareholders who believe in our mission to provide a free-speech beachhead against Big Tech censorship,\u201d Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a statement. ` Nunes even said Trump Media\u2019s cash balance gives the company the opportunity to explore potential mergers and acquisitions. Experts have said the price tag on Trump Media stock defies logic given the company\u2019s financial results and small footprint in social media. Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida\u2019s Warrington College of Business, said \u201crevenue is still anemic\u201d for Trump Media. \u201cAlthough the company is not burning through its ample cash reserves rapidly, it is not generating much revenue, suggesting that there is no reason to think that the company will turn the corner and become profitable in the foreseeable future,\u201d Ritter said. Despite all the fanfare for the public listing earlier this year, Truth Social\u00a0remains a very tiny player in social media. In April, the conservative-friendly social network experienced a 19% year-over-year drop in average daily active US users on iOS and Android to just 113,000, according to market research firm Similarweb. Rival X (formerly known as Twitter) had more than 34 million users on iOS and Android, while Instagram\u2019s Threads had 3.5 million. Trump Media said its financials were reviewed by Semple, Marchal & Cooper, its newly hired accounting firm. The company\u2019s previous accounting firm was\u00a0accused of \u201cmassive fraud\u201d\u00a0by federal regulators this month.

McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}

In a statement late Tuesday, Israel\u2019s Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi said that he\u00a0\u201chas ordered that the equipment be returned to the\u00a0AP news agency,\u201d\u00a0because\u00a0the Israeli\u00a0\u201cMinistry of Defense requested to re-examine the matter of broadcasts from sensitive locations and their effect on the risk of our forces.\u201d Earlier in the day, the Associated Press said Israeli authorities had shut down its live camera feed showing Gaza and seized its equipment in what it decried as an \u201cabusive use by the Israeli government of the country\u2019s new foreign broadcasters law.\u201d \u201cThe Associated Press decries in the strongest terms the actions of the Israeli government,\u201d the non-profit news collective said in a statement. \u201cWe urge the Israeli authorities to return our equipment and enable us to reinstate our live feed immediately so we can continue to provide this important visual journalism to thousands of media outlets around the world.\u201d Karhi said that the AP feed was cut and equipment seized because the AP was providing Al Jazeera with content after the Qatari-based network was banned in the country. The Israeli military regularly classifies areas around Gaza as \u201cclosed military zones,\u201d restricting movement there. The AP\u2019s live feed provided a view of actions in Gaza, where no independent journalists are able to operate because of Israeli and Egyptian restrictions on entry to the strip. The Israeli government\u2019s decision to return broadcasting equipment to the AP came after the White House expressed concerns to the Netanyahu-led government, a White House official told CNN. \u201cAs soon as we learned about the reports, the White House and the State Department immediately engaged with the Government of Israel at high levels to express our serious concern and ask them to reverse this action, which they have publicly committed to do,\u201d National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson told CNN. \u201cThe free press is an essential pillar of democracy and members of the media, including AP, do vital work that must be respected.\u201d The Associated Press applauded the Israeli Ministry of Communications\u2019 decision\u00a0to return its equipment but said it remained concerned about the law at the center of the action. \u201cWhile we are pleased with this development, we remain concerned about the Israeli government\u2019s use of the foreign broadcaster law and the ability of independent journalists to operate freely in Israel.\u201d Earlier, the Foreign Press Association voiced its alarm about the shutdown and confiscation. \u201cIsrael\u2019s move today is a slippery slope. Israel could block other international news agencies from providing live footage of Gaza. It also could allow Israel to block media coverage of virtually any news event on vague security grounds,\u201d the FPA said in a statement. The move comes weeks after\u00a0Israel shut down Al Jazeera\u2019s operations\u00a0in the country, raiding the news outlet\u2019s offices and seizing its communication equipment, prompting swift condemnation from the United Nations and rights groups over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s moves to restrict press freedoms. The law approved by Israel\u2019s parliament last month gives the prime minister and the communications minister the authority to \u201ctemporarily\u201d order the closure of foreign networks operating in Israel that are deemed a threat to national security. News organizations could be banned for a 45-day period, although the government can renew the ban for additional 45-day periods. The law itself is also technically temporary and will expire on July 31 or earlier if an emergency declaration due to the war is canceled. Several legal challenges to the law are pending in Israeli courts. The Israeli Supreme Court recently declined to issue an emergency injunction against the law filed by The Association for Civil Rights in Israel, although a hearing is expected to be held on the challenge by June 6. The group said in its petition filed in early April that the law \u201cviolates freedom of expression, the right to information and freedom of the press,\u201d and \u201ctramples on the principles of the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary, since it includes an \u201coverride clause\u201d that prevents the court from overturning an illegal decision.\u201d Another legal challenge has been filed in the Tel Aviv District Court. In an earlier statement, Karhi had accused the AP of violating its new law by providing a feed to its thousands of news clients, including Al Jazeera. The confiscated equipment included a camera, tripod, two microphones and transmission equipment, the statement said. The press freedom group Reporters Without Borders condemned Israel\u2019s decision to seize the equipment. \u201cAfter having banned Al Jazeera, Israel is lashing out at the AP,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cRSF denounces the seizure of the news outlet\u2019s camera and the interruption of the continuous feed that films Gaza under the pretext that these images are supplying, among others, Al Jazeera.\u201d The Union of Israeli Journalists also condemned the act, calling it \u201ca serious threat to press freedom and democracy.\u201d Israel opposition leader Yair Lapid also denounced the seizure as \u201can act of madness.\u201d \u201cThis is not Al Jazeera, this is an American media outlet that has won 53 Pulitzer Prizes,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis government behaves as if it has decided to make sure at any cost that Israel will be outcast all over the world.

{"id": "2024_05_20_business_what-went-wrong-at-red-lobster", "text": "Last summer, Red Lobster made $20 endless shrimp a permanent menu item. Endless shrimp was a successful annual limited-time offer for Red Lobster for 20 years. But Red Lobster\u2019s latest major shareholder, Thai Union, a Bangkok-based canned seafood company, saw the promotion as a way to sell off the mountains of shrimp it was catching and turned it into an everyday item. (Thai Union became Red Lobster\u2019s largest investor in 2020.) The change cost Red Lobster $11 million. Red Lobster filed for bankruptcy Sunday, and the bankruptcy filing sheds new light on Thai Union\u2019s role in the endless shrimp mishap. Red Lobster said it is investigating the circumstances of that promotion, which Red Lobster management opposed. Under a CEO appointed at the direction of Thai Union, Red Lobster eliminated two of its breaded shrimp suppliers, leaving Thai Union with an exclusive deal to provide shrimp for the chain, the filing said. That led to higher costs, and it did not comply with the company\u2019s typical decision-making process for picking suppliers based on projected demand, according to the chain\u2019s filing. \u201cThis decision created both operational and financial issues for [Red Lobster]\u2026 saddling the company with burdensome supply obligations\u201d to Thai Union, Red Lobster said in the filing. Thai Union did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Endless shrimp alone didn\u2019t doom Red Lobster. The American poster child for seafood was dragged down by a range of factors, say former leaders at the chain and restaurant analysts \u2014 including handoffs between a mix of investors and corporate parents and Thai Union\u2019s mismanagement. \u201cCertain operational decisions by former management have harmed [Red Lobster\u2019s] financial situation in recent years,\u201d Red Lobster said in its bankruptcy filing. The explosive growth and popularity of fast-casual chains like Chipotle and quick-service chains like Chick-fil-A over the past two decades also squeezed Red Lobster. And years of underinvestment in Red Lobster\u2019s marketing, food quality, service and restaurant upgrades hurt the chain\u2019s ability to add Millennials to its core Baby Boomer customer base. \u201cRed Lobster was the foundation of casual dining. They had a position of power and prominence and revolutionized how American consumers eat seafood,\u201d said Alex Susskind, a professor of food and beverage management at Cornell University, in a previous interview with CNN. But the company didn\u2019t build on that foundation, Susskind said. \u201cRed Lobster had incredible popularity among Baby Boomers. They didn\u2019t bring in a newer generation.\u201d Owned by General Mills When the first Red Lobster opened in 1968 in Lakeland, Florida, an hour south of Orlando, casual dining was in its infancy. The brand was started by southern restaurateurs Bill Darden and Charley Woodsby. Darden owned several Howard Johnson\u2019s restaurants, one of the first casual dining concepts. \u201cOur motto was informal and family prices,\u201d Woodsby\u00a0later said. They saw an opportunity to bring seafood to landlocked people at more affordable prices than fine-dining restaurants. \u201cIn most of middle America, you couldn\u2019t get decent seafood. Red Lobster brought it to the masses,\u201d said Jonathan Maze, the editor in chief at Restaurant Business Magazine, a trade publication. \u201cRed Lobster was part of this casual dining revolution.\u201d Just two years into Darden and Woodsby\u2019s venture, General Mills acquired the brand. General Mills owned brands like Wheaties, Cheerios and Betty Crocker, and the company wanted to enter the restaurant industry with Red Lobster\u2019s five no-frills restaurants. By the early 1970s, with General Mills\u2019 advertising muscle behind it, Red Lobster opened restaurants across the South. Red Lobster rose quickly and was the first casual dining chain to advertise on network television, according to a Harvard Business School\u00a0study. Red Lobster also developed the first national seafood distribution system in the 1970s. \u201cMany diners preferred their seafood fried in those days, and Red Lobster\u2019s hush puppies could be considered an early \u2018signature item,\u2019\u201d Joe Lee, the first general manager at Red Lobster and later its president, said in a journal\u00a0article. \u201cFamilies were welcomed with high chairs and a 59-cent child\u2019s plate.\u201d By 1978, Red Lobster had 236 restaurants and $291 million in sales. It had 372 restaurants and $834 million in sales in 1985. In 1995, General Mills spun off its restaurant division into a new company, Darden Restaurants, named for Red Lobster founder Bill Darden. The company initially included the legacy Red Lobster chain and Olive Garden, an upstart chain General Mills had started in 1982. Red Lobster stalls But Red Lobster fell behind its sister brand Olive Garden under Darden. By 2008, Olive Garden\u2019s sales had eclipsed Red Lobster\u2019s. Darden also acquired fast-growing chains such as Longhorn Steakhouse, Capital Grille and Yard House. \u201cDarden stopped investing in Red Lobster. Things slowly deteriorated,\u201d Les Foreman, a director of operations and divisional vice president at Red Lobster from 2002 to 2022, told CNN. Red Lobster\u2019s sales began declining and Darden prioritized investments in its other brands. Darden soon faced pressure from activist investors pushing the company to split in two. Darden responded to activist pressure by announcing plans in 2013 to\u00a0sell Red Lobster, separating the chain from the rest of its business. The following year, Darden\u00a0sold Red Lobster\u00a0to Golden Gate Capital, a private equity firm, for $2.1 billion. To help fund the deal, Red Lobster spun off its real estate assets in a transaction known as a sale leaseback agreement. Red Lobster had long owned its own real estate but would now be paying rent to lease its restaurants. Sale leasebacks are very common in the restaurant industry, but the arrangement wound up hurting Red Lobster because it became stuck with leases it no longer could afford to pay. \u201cThat produced cost pressures on Red Lobster that they\u2019ve never had before,\u201d said analyst John Gordon. \u201cIt became a problem.\u201d At the same time, fast-casual and quick-service restaurants grew with lower prices, thousands of new drive-thru locations and online delivery. These chains pressured the casual dining sector. Casual dining has slipped from 36% of total restaurant industry sales in 2013 to 31% in 2023, according to Technomic, a restaurant research firm. \u2018Cutting costs everywhere\u2019 Red Lobster\u2019s controlling shareholder Thai Union also hurt the brand, say former employees and analysts. Thai Union was a top supplier of shrimp to Red Lobster for more than 20 years. In 2016, Thai Union took a $575 million minority stake in the brand. In 2020, Thai Union deepened its financial interest in Red Lobster. Thai Union saw an opportunity to grow its business and also become a bigger supplier to Red Lobster. It also tested squeezing Red Lobster\u2019s waitstaff to the breaking point to save on labor costs, switching from waiters covering three tables to 10. Red Lobster executives began to run for the doors under Thai Union\u2019s management, resulting in a huge amount of C-suite churn. In 2021 and 2022, Red Lobster brought on a new CEO, chief marketing officer, chief financial officer and chief information officer. All left the company within two years. Then came the all-you-can-eat shrimp mishap last year. \u201cWe were expecting an increase of 20% in customer traffic, but the actual number was up to 40%,\u201d Thai Union CEO Thiraphong Chansiri said in November. Two months later, Thai Union said it would divest from Red Lobster and take a $530 million loss on its investment. The company blamed the pandemic, as well as \u201csustained industry headwinds, higher interest rates and rising material and labor costs.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to stop eating lobster,\u201d Chansiri said this year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/business/what-went-wrong-at-red-lobster/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_food_nestle-glp-1-food-vital-proteins", "text": "Nestl\u00e9, the maker of frozen food brands like Stouffer\u2019s and DiGiorno, is slimming down with a new line of meals for people taking GLP-1 drugs, such as Ozempic, for weight loss. The new frozen food brand called Vital Pursuit will consist of 12 portion-controlled meals, high in protein plus fiber, \u201cintended to be a companion for GLP-1 weight loss medication users and consumers focused on weight management,\u201d the company announced Tuesday. It\u2019s the first brand from Nestl\u00e9 specifically for people on drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, joining other companies in expanding to cash in and remain relevant. J.P. Morgan predicts that obesity medication will soon be a $100 billion market and sees about 9% of the US population being on a weight-loss drug by 2030. The long-term effects of GLP-1s \u2014 or glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists \u2014 on people\u2019s health remains unclear. However, a recent study on Wagovy significantly reduced heart risk in addition to helping with weight loss. The results showed that the average weight loss for people using the medication was sustained for up to 208 weeks, or four years. The drugs have changed the way people eat, both in portion sizes and frequency, according to the company. Nestl\u00e9 North America CEO Steve Presley said in a press release that Vital Pursuit \u201cprovides accessible, great-tasting food options that support the needs of consumers in this emerging category.\u201d A full lineup of Vital Pursuit options was not immediately released, but it will hit grocery stores later this year with a suggested price of $4.99 or less. The meals are made with whole grains or protein pasta and consist of sandwich melts, pizzas and bowls, enriched in nutrients like potassium, calcium and iron that the prescription drug users might miss from eating less food overall. Adding a brand like this to Nestl\u00e9\u2019s portfolio for consumer brands makes sense, according to Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail, especially since GLP-1 drugs could be \u201cdisruptive\u201d to food manufacturers. Nestl\u00e9 also sells Lean Cuisine, a diet-focused frozen food brand launched more than 40 years ago to attract calorie-counting customers, but it\u2019s \u201cseen as old-school\u201d by customers, Saunders told CNN. \u201cThe new brand is positioned as a much more scientific approach with an emphasis on nutrition and balance,\u201d he said. \u201cNestl\u00e9 is hoping to gain new customers and widen its audience.\u201d Companies respond The sudden rise of GLP-1 drugs is also seen as an opportunity by other companies, like GNC, a once-bankrupt chain that sells vitamins and nutritional supplements. Last month, the retailer announced that it was adding a dedicated section in its US stores with vitamins, protein shakes and supplements tailored to people on GLP-1 medications. Costco has started offering Ozempic at its US pharmacies through its low-cost health care partner Sesame. The program, launched in April, includes a video consultation with a weight loss doctor or specialist, a GLP-1 or weight loss prescription, if appropriate, and ongoing support through unlimited messaging and guidance with a health care provider. WeightWatchers\u00a0launched a membership plan\u00a0for people that gives members access to doctors who can prescribe these medications. It also made a $100 million-plus deal to buy Sequence, a telehealth business that offers virtual prescriptions to patients for these weight loss drugs where appropriate. Gyms are also adjusting their strategies as more of their members take\u00a0medications\u00a0for weight loss. Luxury gyms, such as Life Time, are acquiring weight loss clinics with doctors who can prescribe GLP-1s, while Equinox debuted a personal training program for members taking GLP-1s to preserve muscle mass. Food companies, like Nestl\u00e9, are also bracing for GLP-1 consumers to buy fewer sugary snacks and drinks. J.P. Morgan last year said that current GLP-1 users purchased around 8% less food \u2014 including snacks, soft drinks and high-carb products \u2014 over the prior year, compared with consumers who were not on these drugs. Vital Pursuit \u201csends a signal to investors and stakeholders that Nestl\u00e9 is looking at weight-loss drugs and is responding to the opportunity,\u201d Saunders said.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_economy_china-property-crisis-stimulus-challenges-intl-hnk", "text": "Beijing has launched its most ambitious plan yet to rescue its property market, a development that investors have eagerly anticipated for months. But it\u2019s far from certain that the measures will work. The package is centered around Beijing\u2019s adoption of a policy that has already been tested in a major city \u2014 asking local governments to buy unsold homes from developers and convert them into social affordable housing. It also features a reduction in mortgage interest rates and downpayment ratios, and more importantly, 300 billion yuan ($41.5 billion) in cheap central bank cash to fund state purchases of unsold properties. The announcement last week swiftly followed an April meeting of the Politburo, China\u2019s\u00a0top\u00a0ruling\u00a0body, indicating that stabilizing the property sector has become a top priority for Beijing as it tries to revive growth in the world\u2019s second biggest economy. \u201cThe policymakers recognize the urgency to prevent an outright property crisis,\u201d said Zhaopeng Xing, senior China strategist at ANZ Research. \u201cThe new rescue plan demonstrates the policymakers\u2019 resolution to turn things around.\u201d While the urgency is welcome, experts say the current package may be far too small in scale to be effective and could suffer problems with funding. According to Goldman Sachs, the total value of unsold homes, unfinished projects and unused land in China is about 30 trillion yuan ($4.1 trillion). To reduce the supply of housing to levels last seen in 2018, the year the real estate boom peaked, may require more than 7 trillion yuan ($967 billion) for all cities, the Goldman analysts wrote in a Monday research note. That\u2019s more than 20 times the amount of funding announced by the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC). Even though China\u2019s economy expanded faster than expected at the start of this year, growth is being weighed down by the all-important real estate sector, which once accounted for as much as 30% of economic activity. Not enough? Despite the flurry of announcements last week, it\u2019s still unclear exactly how the government purchases will be implemented and how much is needed to fund the buying. Most importantly, there is lack of clarity on where cash-strapped local governments can get the money to pay for it. On Friday, Tao Ling, deputy governor of the PBOC, said the relending program could eventually underpin 500 billion yuan ($69 billion) worth of bank loans to support the buying. But even this figure is much less than what could be needed. Some analysts estimate that hundreds of billions of dollars might be necessary to clear the backlog of millions of empty or unfinished homes across the country. Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, who has called the country\u2019s housing problem \u201cepic,\u201d says just finishing construction of pre-sold homes would require at least 3.2 trillion yuan\u00a0($442 billion). He estimated that there are currently 20 million pre-sold homes that remain unbuilt. Helen Qiao, chief economist for Greater China at Bank of America, said the funding size of a maximum of 500 billion yuan was \u201crather underwhelming.\u201d Without further expansion, the plan was unlikely to make a \u201cnotable difference\u201d to the inventory of empty or unfinished homes, she added. Where is the money? It\u2019s also unclear where indebted local governments can get the funding, beyond the relatively small amounts the PBOC is channeling via state banks. The Housing Ministry said Friday that local governments can instruct local state-owned enterprises to help purchase some unsold homes from developers. But local government financing vehicles (LGFV), which are already carrying a huge amount of \u201chidden\u201d debt, are not allowed to make the purchases, according to Tao from PBOC. That leaves fewer options for local authorities to find the cash. Chinese cities have already racked up about $15 trillion in debt, much of it hidden, having borrowed heavily in recent years to cover the cost of pandemic-related spending and infrastructure projects.  The housing market slump has exacerbated their financial woes, as land sales typically account for more than 40% of local government revenue. The debt distress has forced many Chinese cities to slash spending, including suspending basic services, such as heating people\u2019s homes in winter. \u201cIt\u2019s debatable whether it\u2019s a good idea to put more debt on already highly-leveraged local governments,\u201d Jing Liu and Taylor Wang, China economists for HSBC, said in a note on Monday. China\u2019s property industry began to cool in 2019 and fell into a deep trough about three years ago after a government-led clampdown on developers\u2019 borrowing. Policy rescue efforts started as early as 2022, when the slump triggered crises at some developers and sparked protests by tens of thousands of homebuyers in response to delayed or stalled projects. But the measures have been largely ineffective, resulting in a deterioration of cash flow among developers. The most recent saga at Vanke, a major real estate company, suggests every developer is at risk, Xing said. Just the beginning Addressing the oversupply of unsold homes is only the first step, experts say. Broadly speaking, the government needs to tackle three problems, according to Goldman analysts. The first step involves bailing out developers and helping them complete pre-sold but unfinished homes, which is what the new measures are intended to tackle. \u201cThis is important for maintaining overall social stability and stemming further declines in new home sales,\u201d they said. But the second and third steps involve boosting housing demand and mitigating the contraction in property construction, they said. That requires more detailed measures to revive consumer confidence and boost housing prices. Making matters worse, the external environment has become increasingly difficult. Last week, the US government announced new tariffs on China, which could be followed by similar action by the European Union. Former President Donald Trump has threatened to\u00a0go even further by slapping 60% tariffs on imports from China\u00a0if he is re-elected. Xing estimated that Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs could cut China\u2019s growth rate by as much as 0.9%. \u201cThe rescue is not a game-changer for low-tier cities\u2019 housing, which will likely remain depressed,\u201d Michelle Lam and Wei Yao, China economists at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said in a research note on Monday. They also think the rescue plan needs to be expanded, with more detailed policies to be announced. But what matters the most is that Beijing has taken the bold initiative, which will help stabilize expectations. Taking a long-term perspective, the plan could reduce the risk of China sliding into a \u201cdeflationary spiral\u201d like Japan did, as a key lesson from there is that policy makers should avoid doing too little, too late, they said. \u201c[This might be] the beginning of the end of China\u2019s housing crisis,\u201d they added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/economy/china-property-crisis-stimulus-challenges-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_tech_openai-pausing-flirty-chatgpt-voice", "text": "Actor Scarlett Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN on Monday that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman would use a synthetic voice released with an\u00a0update to ChatGPT \u201cso eerily similar\u201d to hers. The statement comes after OpenAI said it is hitting the pause button on the update after comparisons with a fictional voice assistant portrayed in the quasi-dystopian film \u201cHer\u201d by Johansson. The retreat by OpenAI follows a backlash to the artificial voice, known as Sky, which critics described as being overly familiar with users and sounded as if it had emerged from a male developer\u2019s fantasy. It was widely mocked for its flirtatious tone. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard questions about how we chose the voices in ChatGPT, especially Sky,\u201d OpenAI said in a post on X Monday. \u201cWe are working to pause the use of Sky while we address them.\u201d Johansson said Altman offered to hire her last September to voice the ChatGPT 4.0 system.\u00a0She said she declined the offer for \u201cpersonal reasons.\u201d \u201cTwo days before the ChatGPT 4.0 demo was released, Mr. Altman contacted my agent, asking me to reconsider. Before we could connect, the system was out there.\u201d Johansson said she hired legal counsel, and said OpenAI \u201creluctantly agreed\u201d to take down the \u201cSky\u201d voice after her counsel sent Altman two letters. \u201cIn a time when we are all grappling with deepfakes and the protection of our own likeness, our own work, our own identities, I believe these are questions that deserve absolute clarity. I look forward to resolution in the form of transparency and the passage of appropriate legislation to help ensure that individual rights are protected,\u201d Johansson wrote. The voice in question is not derived from Johansson\u2019s, the company said in a blog post Sunday, but instead \u201cbelongs to a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice.\u201d Altman reiterated the company\u2019s stance that \u201cSky\u201d was voiced by a different actress in a statement Monday, following Johansson\u2019s claims. \u201cThe voice of Sky is not Scarlett Johansson\u2019s, and it was never intended to resemble hers,\u201d Altman said. \u201cWe cast the voice actor behind Sky\u2019s voice before any outreach to Ms. Johansson. Out of respect for Ms. Johansson, we have paused using Sky\u2019s voice in our products. We are sorry to Ms. Johansson that we didn\u2019t communicate better.\u201d OpenAI said that with each of its AI voices, it tried to create \u201can approachable voice that inspires trust,\u201d one that contains a \u201crich tone\u201d and is \u201cnatural and easy to listen to.\u201d The ChatGPT voice mode that used the Sky voice had not yet been widely released, but videos from the product announcement and teasers of OpenAI employees speaking with it went viral online last week. Some who heard Sky derided it as perhaps too easy to listen to. Last week, the controversy inspired a segment on The Daily Show in which senior correspondent Desi Lydic described Sky as a \u201chorny robot baby voice.\u201d \u201cThis is clearly programmed to feed dudes\u2019 egos,\u201d Lydic said. \u201cYou can really tell that a man built this tech.\u201d Even Altman appeared to acknowledge the widespread parallels users were drawing with Johansson when he posted to X on the day of the product\u2019s announcement: \u201cher.\u201d Johansson said Altman used this post to insinuate \u201cthe similarity was intentional.\u201d \u201cHer\u201d is the title of the 2013 film in which Johansson portrays an artificially intelligent voice assistant with whom the protagonist, played by Joaquin Phoenix, falls in love, only to be left heartbroken when the AI admits she is also in love with hundreds of other users and later becomes inaccessible altogether. Questions about leadership The criticism surrounding Sky highlights broader societal concerns about the potential biases of a technology designed by tech companies largely led or funded by White men. The announcement came after OpenAI leaders were forced to defend their safety practices over the weekend after a departing employee called the company\u2019s priorities into question. Jan Leike, who formerly led a team focused on long-term AI safety but left OpenAI last week along with Co-Founder and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever, posted a thread on X Friday claiming that \u201cover the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products\u201d at OpenAI. He also raised concerns that the company was not devoting enough resources to preparing for a possible future \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d (AGI) that could be smarter than humans. Altman quickly responded saying he appreciated Leike\u2019s commitment to \u201csafety culture\u201d and added: \u201cHe\u2019s right we have a lot more to do; we are committed to doing it.\u201d The company also confirmed to CNN that in recent weeks it had begun to dissolve the team Leike led, and instead was integrating members of the team across its various research groups. A spokesperson for the company said that structure would help OpenAI better achieve its safety objectives. OpenAI President Greg Brockman responded in a longer post on Saturday, which was signed with both his name and Altman\u2019s, laying out the company\u2019s approach to long-term AI safety. \u201cWe have raised awareness of the risks and opportunities of AGI so that the world can better prepare for it,\u201d Brockman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve repeatedly demonstrated the incredible possibilities from scaling up deep learning and analyzed their implications; called for international governance of AGI before such calls were popular; and helped pioneer the science of assessing AI systems for catastrophic risks.\u201d He added that as AI becomes smarter and more integrated with humans\u2019 daily lives, the company is focused on having in place \u201ca very tight feedback loop, rigorous testing, careful consideration at every step, world-class security, and harmony of safety and capabilities.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/tech/openai-pausing-flirty-chatgpt-voice/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_business_red-lobster-endless-shrimp-bankruptcy", "text": "Red Lobster\u2019s bankruptcy report included a blow-by-blow account of its path toward financial ruin, and it was as juicy as a fresh crab leg dipped in butter and washed down with a crisp Chardonnay. ICYMI: Red Lobster on Monday began its widely anticipated bankruptcy process, hoping to offload debt and raise cash to keep the business from foundering, my colleague Nathaniel Meyersohn writes. Most likely, that means you can still get your cheddar biscuit and bottomless shrimp fix, though it closed nearly 100 restaurants last week and many more locations will shut down in the coming months. What went wrong for Red Lobster, the chain that effectively introduced the concept of affordable seafood and kitschy coastal aesthetic to landlubbers across the Midwest and beyond? First, Red Lobster got screwed by private equity. Then, it got screwed by its own managers. Back in 2014, the Darden restaurant group spun off Red Lobster to a private equity firm. To finance the deal, that PE firm sold off most of Red Lobster\u2019s property assets and then leased them back to the restaurants. But, as we learned in the bankruptcy filing, the vast majority of those restaurants were being charged rent at above market rates. That cash drain might have been manageable under normal circumstances. But then 2020 came. Red Lobster was hit with \u201cfinancial and operational challenges\u201d \u2014 namely, the one-two punch of the pandemic and the price inflation it set off, followed by the bone-headed strategic blunders that left the restaurant with $1 billion in debt and less than $30 million in cash on hand. Management wasn\u2019t doing the chain any favors, either, as Red Lobster\u2019s new CEO/bankruptcy shaman Jonathan Tibus notes in the Chapter 11 filing. Specifically, Tibus takes aim at his predecessor Paul Kenny and Thai Union, the Bangkok-based seafood supplier that took a majority stake in Red Lobster in 2020. Thai Union hand-picked Kenny to lead Red Lobster two years ago. Thai Union, under Kenny\u2019s direction, elbowed out other shrimp suppliers, \u201cleaving Thai Union with an exclusive deal that led to higher costs to Red Lobster,\u201d according to the filing. And if you\u2019re the exclusive provider of shrimp to America\u2019s biggest seafood chain, what\u2019d be better than making that limited-time all-you-can-eat shrimp deal a permanent menu item? Ultimately, it was Kenny who pushed through the decision to turn Red Lobster\u2019s \u201cUltimate Endless Shrimp\u201d promotion into a permanent $20 menu item \u201cdespite significant pushback from other members of the company\u2019s management team,\u201d according to the filing. CNN has reached out to Kenny for comment. Thai Union didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The all-you-can-eat shrimp deal alone didn\u2019t doom Red Lobster, but boy did it do some damage at a time when the chain was already buckling. The promotion had historically been a limited time thing, and it was a huge hit. Twenty bucks, for all the shrimp? Sign me up! Of course, that\u2019s how every other crustacean-consuming American responded. Because in this country, \u201call you can eat\u201d is as much a dare as it is a deal. And the lingering hangover of inflation left everyone hungry for a $20 meal that could conceivably provide a week\u2019s worth of sustenance in a single sitting. It cost Red Lobster $11 million in a single quarter. Kenny and Co. not only underestimated how much we could eat, but how long we would take to do it. Once the Endless Shrimp order was placed, folks lingered at their tables to maximize their ROI. Wait times got longer, frustrating staff and customers alike.

{"id": "2024_05_21_business_ai-jobs-higher-wages-productivity", "text": "Jobs that require artificial intelligence skills offer significantly higher wages than those that don\u2019t, according to new research published Tuesday. Consultancy PwC studied advertisements, posted last year, for a range of jobs, including app programmers, lawyers and accountants. It found that wages for AI-related roles were on average 25% higher in the United States than for comparable jobs in the same field that did not require those skills. The premium was 14% in the United Kingdom, and 11% in Canada. The differences were particularly pronounced in certain professions: lawyers in the United States with AI skills could earn a 49% wage premium and financial analysts a 33% premium compared with workers in equivalent traditional jobs. PwC\u2019s report is based on an analysis of more than 500 million job ads across 15 countries in North America, Europe and Asia. \u201cCountries and sectors that have a high demand for AI skills tend to see higher wage premiums, especially if there is a scarcity of skilled professionals,\u201d Mehdi Sahneh, senior economist at PwC UK, said in a statement. Between 2012 and 2023, the number of jobs requiring AI skills grew 3.5 times faster than the total of all jobs across the countries studied, according to the report. Barret Kupelian, chief economist at PwC UK, also noted that \u201cthe menu of skills required by employers in occupations exposed to AI is changing about 25% faster than those which aren\u2019t.\u201d \u201cAs pick-up of AI continues, this trend is likely to intensify, creating new roles whilst also reducing demand for some skills that can be done more efficiently using AI,\u201d he added. A boon for productivity The report also found that labor productivity in industries most exposed to AI \u2014\u00a0that is, those where AI can be more readily used to perform certain tasks, such as financial services \u2014\u00a0is growing 4.8 times faster than in other sectors. A company becomes more productive if it produces the same amount of goods or services, or more, with fewer staff or with its employees working fewer hours. Higher labor productivity is the key driver of higher living standards. \u201cProductivity growth is crucial to boosting real wage growth and sustaining economic growth, particularly when the number of hours worked in an economy may be declining as populations are aging,\u201d Randall Kroszner, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s financial policy committee, said in speech Tuesday. Improving productivity is particularly important for certain countries, such as the United Kingdom where it has grown much more slowly since the global financial crisis than in the years before. \u201cAI could be the missing piece of the UK\u2019s productivity puzzle, bringing a boost to the economy, wages, and living standards,\u201d said Sahneh at PwC.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/business/ai-jobs-higher-wages-productivity/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_food_mar-jac-plant-poultry-death", "text": "Children have again been found working at a Mar-Jac Poultry slaughterhouse, according to the US Department of Labor. The latest discovery in Alabama comes less than a year after a teen worker was killed at a company facility in Mississippi. In a civil complaint filed May 7, the DOL said that investigators at its wage and hour division \u201cdiscovered oppressive child labor at [Mar-Jac\u2019s] poultry processing facility, namely children working on the kill floor deboning poultry and cutting carcasses.\u201d The complaint added that \u201cthe children had been working at the facility for months.\u201d Mar-Jac operates facilities in Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. The DOL\u2019s recent allegation follows an incident last year in which a teen died at a Mar-Jac facility in Mississippi. According to Mar-Jac Poultry Alabama\u2019s website, \u201cMar-Jac Poultry does not sell to the general public, individual restaurants or convenience stores. We sell primarily to wholesale distributors and various national fast food establishments.\u201d It didn\u2019t list which fast food companies it supplied. A DOL spokesperson told CNN Tuesday that \u201cthe wage and hour division has multiple ongoing investigations of Mar-Jac plants in Alabama and Mississippi.\u201d Federal labor law bans children from certain jobs in slaughterhouses and meat packaging plants, including using or cleaning machinery, because of the hazardous conditions. In the May complaint, the Labor department said Mar-Jac had employed \u201cseveral minors under the age of 18 in the particularly hazardous occupations of working on the kill floor.\u201d The jobs included \u201changing poultry along fast-moving machine lines, de-boning poultry, and cutting poultry carcasses.\u201d The complaint added that products coming out of the facility through the end of the month are \u201ctainted by child labor,\u201d making them \u201chot goods\u201d under the Fair Labor Standards Act. That means Mar-Jac has been \u201cunjustly enriched, accruing substantial ill-gotten gains,\u201d by shipment of these goods in violation of labor law, the complaint said. \u201cMar-Jac will continue to vigorously defend itself and expects to prevail in this matter,\u201d according to a company statement sent to CNN. \u201cMar-Jac is committed to complying with all relevant laws, including but not limited to the child labor regulations, and already has taken affirmative steps to go beyond what the regulations require.\u201d The workers in question had given the company documents showing they were over 18, according to the statement, which noted that Mar-Jac has a policy against hiring minors. The allegations come after a 16-year-old worker was killed at a Mar-Jac processing plant in Mississippi in July. He was the second employee who died while working at the facility in just over two years. Mar-Jac Poultry told CNN at the time that the teen died from injuries suffered in what it described as an \u201caccident.\u201d The company added that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which reviews workplace injuries among other labor issues, was investigating the incident with the \u201cfull support and cooperation of the company.\u201d Earlier this year, the DOL proposed a $212,646 fine against the processor. When asked about the status of the request by CNN, the spokesperson said that the department can\u2019t offer further comment as its investigations are ongoing. The Labor Department has lately been trying to crack down on incidents of child labor, especially at meatpacking facilities. In February 2023, the Department of Labor and Health and Human Services said that they were increasing efforts to fight child labor. The DOL noted at the time that it had seen a 69% increase in the illegal employment of children by companies. A janitorial company was recently fined $649,000 after an investigation found it hired minors for dangerous jobs cleaning slaughterhouses. Fayette Janitorial Service had employed at least 24 children, including those as young as 13, according to the DOL investigation. The minors had been working overnight shifts at two separate slaughter facilities, according to the DOL. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Parija Kavilanz and Amy Simonson contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_16_business_royal-mail-takeover-daniel-kretinsky", "text": "Royal Mail dates back to the Tudors. It has been operating a postal service in England since the reign of Henry VIII. Now this most British of institutions is on the brink of being sold to a Czech billionaire, Daniel K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd, raising fears about the fate of thousands of workers and a key national service. British logistics company International Distribution Services (IDS), which owns the loss-making postal service, said Wednesday that it was \u201cminded to recommend\u201d to its shareholders a \u00a33.70-per-share ($4.69) takeover offer from K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd\u2019s EP Group. EP Group has until May 29 to convert its \u00a33.5 billion ($4.4 billion) non-biding offer into a formal bid for IDS. The likely sale would come after a difficult few years for Royal Mail, which was privatized in 2013. It has suffered a sharp drop in demand for its services, and losses have ballooned. Appeals to the government to be released from its obligation to deliver letters six days a week have fallen on deaf ears. A spokesperson for the UK Department for Business and Trade told CNN that it had \u201cno current plans\u201d to change Royal Mail\u2019s legally binding service obligations. \u201cAny future changes to Royal Mail\u2019s operation will need to take into account the impacts on businesses and vulnerable consumers who rely on this vital service,\u201d the spokesperson said. So who is the white knight ready to take on a company that, during the last financial year, was losing \u00a38 million ($10 million) a week? The \u2018Czech Sphinx\u2019 K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd is a Czech national who has made his fortune through a sprawling empire of European energy companies, retailers and football clubs. He is worth an estimated $7.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The 49-year-old magnate began his career as a lawyer, before moving to a Czech investment bank, where he became a partner in 2003, according to EP Group\u2019s website. A few years later, K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd co-founded Energetick\u00fd a pr\u016fmyslov\u00fd holding, or EPH, which owns European gas- and coal-fired power plants, commodities trading firms and freight companies, its website shows. In 2016, the billionaire founded EP Group with business partner Patrik Tk\u00e1\u010d. Through its investment arm Vesa Equity Investment, K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd has acquired stakes in big-name brands such as Foot Locker (FL) in the United States, FNAC in France, and supermarket Sainsbury\u2019s in the United Kingdom. He has come to be known as a mysterious personality given his reluctance to speak publicly about his business dealings. So elusive, in fact, that the Polish version of Newsweek magazine dubbed him the \u201cCzech Sphinx\u201d in 2019. The Sphinx, a mythical creature originating in Greek mythology, requires travelers to solve a riddle before allowing them to pass. But some fans of British soccer will already know his name. Three years ago, the businessman bought a 27% stake in West Ham United Football Club through another of his investment firms. That makes K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd the club\u2019s second-biggest shareholder, according its website. \u2018As British as it gets\u2019 The potential buyout of Royal Mail has stirred anxieties about the consequences of the iconic British institution coming under foreign ownership. \u201cAs a rule, we welcome international investment in British companies,\u201d UK finance minister Jeremy Hunt told reporters Friday. \u201cBut we do always look at national security considerations and make sure that, in terms of our core infrastructure, there are no risks to those going forward, and any bid for Royal Mail would go through that normal process.\u201d Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, which represents about 110,000 Royal Mail workers, said the potential takeover by K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd\u2019s investment firm posed a \u201cthreat\u201d to the future of postal services in the UK. He asked that EP Group \u201cimmediately demonstrate\u201d a commitment to working with the CWU and rule out any potential break-up of Royal Mail or diminishment of its workers\u2019 pension pots. \u201cIt cannot be right that a key part of national infrastructure is allowed to be owned by individuals or companies who have no vision for the future and no clear plan to put the workforce at the heart of turning Royal Mail around,\u201d Ward said in a statement Wednesday. Jonathan Reynolds, business spokesperson for the UK\u2019s opposition Labour Party, urged EP Group in a letter to provide \u201ccast-iron guarantees\u201d that it would keep Royal Mail\u2019s headquarters in the UK, and would work closely with its labor union. \u201cRoyal Mail is as British as it gets, and Labour will take the necessary steps to safeguard its undeniable identity and place in public life,\u201d he wrote in the letter, which he posted on X. In a statement last month, EP Group said it was \u201ca committed long-term investor in the UK\u201d and believed that private investment in Royal Mail was \u201ccrucial\u201d as the service faced escalating competition with multinational companies in the UK postal market. \u201cRoyal Mail is an important national asset that would benefit from being able to take a longer-term view,\u201d the firm said. \u201c(EP Group) is prepared to support this iconic business as it transforms and rebuilds into a modern postal operator delivering high-quality service to its customers, stability to its workforce and sustainable financial performance.\u201d Ivana Kottasov\u00e1 contributed reporting.

A spokesperson for London-based Arup told CNN on Friday that it notified Hong Kong police in January about the fraud incident, and confirmed that fake voices and images were used. \u201cUnfortunately, we can\u2019t go into details at this stage as the incident is still the subject of an ongoing investigation. However, we can confirm that fake voices and images were used,\u201d the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \u201cOur financial stability and business operations were not affected and none of our internal systems were compromised,\u201d the person added. Hong Kong police said in February that during the elaborate scam the employee, a finance worker, was duped into attending a video call with people he believed were the chief financial officer and other members of staff, but all of whom turned out to be deepfake re-creations. The authorities did not name the company or parties involved at the time. According to police, the worker had initially suspected he had received a phishing email from the company\u2019s UK office, as it specified the need for a secret transaction to be carried out. However, the worker put aside his doubts after the video call because other people in attendance had looked and sounded just like colleagues he recognized. He subsequently agreed to send a total of 200 million Hong Kong dollars \u2014 about $25.6 million. The amount was sent across 15 transactions, Hong Kong public broadcaster RTHK reported, citing police. \u201cDeepfake\u201d normally refers to fake videos that have been created using artificial intelligence (AI) and look extremely realistic. Earlier this year, pornographic AI-generated images of pop star\u00a0Taylor Swift\u00a0spread across social media, underscoring the damaging potential posed by AI technology. Attacks \u2018rising sharply\u2019 As a top engineering consulting firm, Arup has 18,500 employees across 34 offices around the world. It was responsible for landmarks such as the Bird\u2019s Nest stadium, site of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. \u201cLike many other businesses around the globe, our operations are subject to regular attacks, including invoice fraud, phishing scams, WhatsApp voice spoofing, and deepfakes. What we have seen is that the number and sophistication of these attacks has been rising sharply in recent months,\u201d Rob Greig, Arup\u2019s global chief information officer, said in the emailed statement. Authorities around the world are growing increasingly concerned about the sophistication of deepfake technology and the nefarious uses it can be put to. In an internal memo seen by CNN, Arup\u2019s East Asia regional chairman, Michael Kwok, said the \u201cfrequency and sophistication of these attacks are rapidly increasing globally, and we all have a duty to stay informed and alert about how to spot different techniques used by scammers.\u201d Kwok returned to the role earlier this month, replacing Andy Lee, who announced his departure from Arup on his LinkedIn page about a week ago after 26 years at the company.

{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}

Picking a successor Earlier this year, some of the bank\u2019s top executives were moved into new roles in order to expand their experience. The bank appointed Marianne Lake as the sole CEO of the consumer division, an area previously run by both Lake and Jennifer Piepszak. Piepszak, meanwhile, now leads the company\u2019s newly combined commercial and investment bank with her co-CEO Troy Rohrbaugh. Rohrbaugh is the former head of trading and securities services for the bank. Other potential successors include Mary Erdoes, CEO of asset and wealth management; chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum and president and chief operating officer Daniel Pinto. In 2020, Dimon experienced an \u201cacute aortic dissection\u201d \u2014 a tear in the inner lining of the aorta blood vessel \u2014 requiring surgery. Then co-COOs Gordon Smith and Daniel Pinto lead the company in his absence. Smith retired from the bank in January 2022. Looking ahead Dimon\u00a0underwent treatment\u00a0for throat cancer in 2014. In an interview with CNN, he spoke about how being diagnosed with cancer changed his outlook on life. \u201cEveryone knows they\u2019re going to die, but at one point it\u2019s right here and you realize it\u2019s true and it\u2019s true maybe sooner than you think,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s nice to end every day by saying, \u2018That was a good day.\u2019 Every meeting, that was a good meeting. Every week, that was a good week.\u201d As for what\u2019s next, Dimon says he hasn\u2019t entirely ruled out a future in politics. Last spring\u00a0he told Bloomberg, \u201cI love my country, and maybe one day I\u2019ll serve my country in one capacity or another.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/investing/jamie-dimon-jpmorgan-succession-plan/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}

Federal prosecutors in Manhattan called the scheme perpetrated by Anton Peraire-Bueno, 24, and James Peraire-Bueno, 28, \u201cnovel\u201d and said the case marked the first time that such a fraud had ever been the subject of U.S. criminal\u00a0charges. Authorities said they executed their elaborate heist in April 2023, stealing $25 million from traders in just 12 seconds by fraudulently gaining access to pending transactions and altering the movement of cryptocurrency. \u201cAs we allege, the defendants\u2019 scheme calls the very integrity of the blockchain into question,\u201d U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said.

Anton Peraire-Bueno was arrested in Boston, while James Peraire-Bueno was arrested in New York. Their lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Both\u00a0brothers\u00a0had attended Cambridge, Massachusetts-based MIT, where according to prosecutors they studied computer science and math and developed the skills and education they relied upon to carry out their fraud. The indictment alleged that for months, the Peraire-Bueno\u00a0brothers\u00a0plotted to manipulate and tamper with the protocols used to validate transactions for inclusion on the Ethereum blockchain, a public ledger that records each cryptocurrency transaction. Prosecutors said they did so by exploiting a vulnerability in the code of software called MEV-boost that is used by most Ethereum network \u201cvalidators,\u201d who are responsible for checking that new transactions are valid before they are added to the blockchain.

{"id": "2024_05_20_media_vox-relaunch-reliable-sources", "text": "Vox\u00a0is preparing to celebrate its 10th birthday \u2014 making a major change to its business model that reflects how digital news publishers are scrambling to evolve as they are increasingly starved of referral traffic and advertising revenue. Not only will Vox debut a refreshed website on Tuesday morning to mark its 10th trip around the sun (fear not, the trademark yellow is not going away), it will also launch a membership program, its executives told CNN Monday, as the digital publisher becomes the latest news outlet to lean into subscriptions to diversify and grow its revenue stream. The subscription program \u2014 which will cost $5 a month, or $50 a year \u2014 will give members access to an array of exclusive content, including newsletters, a digital magazine, a monthly bonus episode of \u201cThe Highlight Podcast,\u201d live virtual tapings of audio programs, interactive video interviews, and more. \u201cIt is so incredibly important to diversify our revenue and business model,\u201d\u00a0Swati Sharma, the editor-in-chief and publisher of Vox, told CNN by phone Monday. \u201cWe have to be strategic.\u201d While the site and its suite of content will continue to remain free to readers, its new members-only program is additive to Vox\u2019s existing content and will be the only programming behind a paywall. The outlet will count the revenue it earns from subscriptions as an added stream, with the publisher opting for a hybrid model consisting of multiple forms of revenue, including advertising and grants. Sharma said that building a members-only tier for Vox\u2019s loyal fans was the natural step after finding success soliciting reader donations, which the outlet has done since 2020. In those four years, it has received more than 100,000 contributions,\u00a0Vox Media\u2019s\u00a0consumer revenue chief\u00a0Priyanka Arya\u00a0told CNN. Now, with members-only benefits aimed at enticing subscribers, coupled with the hiring of\u00a0Bill Carey\u00a0as executive director of memberships, the digital publication is hoping to strengthen its relationship with readers. \u201cWe are taking a bet on people caring about news organizations,\u201d Sharma told me. \u201cBut I think that it\u2019s a bet worth taking.\u201d The move could not come at a more critical juncture. News publishers are navigating challenging terrain, and most have been forced to undergo painful layoffs in recent years, including Vox. The stormy seas have been made even tougher by the rapid advancement and deployment of artificial intelligence. Not only has\u00a0Meta\u00a0turned its back on news publishers, but\u00a0Google, which so many outlets have become quite dependent on, announced last week it will infuse its dominant search engine with A.I. That move has\u00a0prompted alarm\u00a0over the possibility referral traffic to news outlets will slow to a trickle. \u201cIt worries me, and it should worry everyone in journalism,\u201d Sharma said. The daunting circumstance has made establishing direct pipelines between news outlets and audiences more important than ever. Which is likely why so many major newsrooms have signaled they will, in one way or another, wade into creating and/or bolstering subscription models that include members-only content to supplement other revenue streams. Looking ahead to its next decade, Sharma told me she wants to see Vox identify solutions to some of the biggest problems plaguing the world, expanding on its coverage of issues ranging from climate change to gun violence to loneliness. Sharma emphasized that while it is important to cover such paramount issues, it is equally important to offer readers a way to walk away empowered with steps they can take to help improve society. \u201cVox was such an incredible bet to make,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cIt was offering something very specific at that time, which still resonates \u2026 Vox pioneered the explainer format and that is everywhere today.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve explained the news,\u201d Sharma added. \u201cThe next step is shaping the world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/media/vox-relaunch-reliable-sources/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. Major business leaders and economists are worried about America\u2019s growing debt problem. Last week, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon expressed fear that a crisis is looming and that unchecked deficit spending could explode. \u201cAny country can borrow money and drive some growth, but that may not always lead to good growth,\u201d he said in an interview with Sky News. \u201cI think America should be quite aware that we have got to focus on our fiscal deficit issues a little bit more, and that is important for the world.\u201d Dimon went on to say that the deficit is \u201cwhy we have higher inflation\u201d and that he hopes that the US government \u201creally focuses\u201d on reducing the deficit. \u201cAt one point it will cause a problem, and why should you wait?\u201d he said. That problem \u201cwill be caused by the market, and then you will be forced to deal with it and probably in a far more uncomfortable way than if you dealt with it to start.\u201d What\u2019s happening: Bridgewater hedge fund founder Ray Dalio also told the Financial Times last week that investors should be \u201cworried about the US debt picture.\u201d Economist and former dean of Columbia Business School Glenn Hubbard told Before the Bell last week that interest \u201cpayments on the national debt, which were essentially zero a couple of years ago, are now as big as defense spending.\u201d The next president, he said, will have to deal with this issue. \u201cHe may not be campaigning on it, but whoever he is, he\u2019s going to have to do something about it,\u201d he said. So why the sudden confluence of concern? The big picture: Between the Trump-era tax cuts and Covid-era stimulus programs, the national debt has exploded in recent years. Spending via President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act has continued to add to the debt. The United States government is spending a lot more than it\u2019s bringing in \u2014 it has run a budget deficit for six of the first seven months of this fiscal year. So far this fiscal year, the deficit has accumulated to about $855 billion \u2013 more than 6% of US gross domestic product (a measurement of the economy). That adds to the $34.6 trillion cumulative debt load the US has on its shoulders. The problem isn\u2019t just the large debt and deficit, it\u2019s that the US is running a deficit that\u2019s equivalent to nearly 7% of GDP while the economy is at full employment and is performing at its full potential, Jason Thomas, head of global research & investment strategy at Carlyle, told CNN.  What that implies is that if the US hits a recession \u2014 requiring the government to boost spending on stimulus programs even as tax receipts decline \u2014 \u201cyou\u2019re likely looking at a deficit that could be nine or 10% of GDP,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThis is absolutely unsustainable.\u201d Why it matters: As deficits grow, the federal government has to issue more Treasury securities. That means they have to increase yields to attract more investors. That also raises borrowing costs across financial markets, hurting economic growth. Last month, the IMF said the high and rising level of US government debt risked driving up borrowing costs around the world and undermining global financial stability, reports my colleague Hanna Ziady. That warning followed an even blunter message from the head of the Congressional Budget Office, the US Congress\u2019s independent fiscal watchdog, which said the United States risked a bond market crisis of the kind that engulfed the United Kingdom under former Prime Minister Liz Truss. The US also has to pay interest on this growing debt. The government currently spends $2.4 billion on interest payments each day, according to the Peterson Foundation. Those payments are expected to double within the next decade as Treasuries issued during the period of near-zero interest rates mature and are replaced by bonds with higher yields. Why now: 82% of voters say they want the president and Congress to spend more time addressing the debt, and 80% say their level of concern has increased over the last few years, but government officials want to avoid talking about tax increases or reduced spending in an election year, said Hubbard. \u201cThis is not, as far as I can tell, much of a topic of the campaign,\u201d echoed Thomas. \u201cThat suggests to me that it\u2019s probably not going to be addressed.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, the 10-year US Treasury yield could hit \u201c5.5% before you have a lot of political pressure [it currently sits at 4.4%]. At that time we would have mortgage rates at 8%,\u201d he said. Trump Media lost more than $300 million last quarter on very little revenue Trump Media & Technology Group lost more than $300 million during the first quarter and generated very little revenue, the owner of Truth Social announced in a press release Monday. The results will raise additional questions about the multi-billion dollar valuation on the newly public company, which is majority owned by former President Donald Trump, reports my colleague Matt Egan. Trump Media (DJT) reported a loss of $327.6 million during the first three months of the year, compared with a loss of $210,300 a year earlier. In the press release, Trump Media said that at this \u201cearly stage\u201d in its development, the company \u201cremains focused on long-term product development, rather than quarterly revenue.\u201d It acknowledged that its advertising business is just getting off the ground and expressed confidence that new products like streaming will boost its results in the future. The company blamed the losses on non-cash expenses from the conversion of promissory notes and the elimination of previous liabilities. \u201cAfter an unprecedented, years-long process, we have consummated our merger and dispensed with the vast bulk of merger-related expenses, leaving the Company well-capitalized and supported by a legion of retail shareholders who believe in our mission to provide a free-speech beachhead against Big Tech censorship,\u201d Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a statement. ` Trump Media reported an operating loss of $12.1 million, with a chunk of that being driven by one-time payments related to the closing of its merger with a blank-check company earlier this year. The company generated just $770,500 of revenue, marking the second-straight quarter where its revenue totaled less than $1 million. Trump Media said that it has \u201csufficient\u201d cash to fund the business \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201d The company listed a cash balance of $274 million as of the end of March \u2014 a sum boosted by its deal to go public. FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg will resign following a scathing investigation that detailed a toxic workplace Martin Gruenberg, head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, will step down following a scathing independent investigation detailing pervasive sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying at the agency charged with regulating the banking sector, reports my colleague Elisabeth Buchwald. \u201cIn light of recent events, I am prepared to step down from my responsibilities once a successor is confirmed,\u201d Gruenberg said in a statement on Monday. \u201cUntil that time, I will continue to fulfill my responsibilities as Chairman of the FDIC, including the transformation of the FDIC\u2019s workplace culture.\u201d Gruenberg\u2019s announcement of his intent to resign comes hours after Sen. Sherrod Brown, a top Democrat who leads the Senate Banking Committee,\u00a0called for \u201cnew leadership\u201d\u00a0at the FDIC. \ufeffGruenberg joined the FDIC board of directors almost two decades ago. He\u2019s served as chair of the agency for nearly 10 of the past 13 years. The FDIC commissioned a report by law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, which ultimately spurred Gruenberg\u2019s resignation. It confirmed the findings of a November\u00a0Wall Street Journal investigation\u00a0revealing a long-standing problematic culture. It did not find that Gruenberg alone was responsible for the issues described in depth in the report based on interviews with over 500 employees. However, it documented several instances where Gruenberg lashed out at subordinates \u201cparticularly when being delivered bad news or conveyed views with which he disagrees.\u201d That caused staffers to delay delivering news they feared would upset him. Gruenberg\u2019s temperament \u201cmay hinder his ability to establish trust and confidence in leading meaningful culture change,\u201d the report added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}

The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can \u201clisten\u201d to people\u2019s questions and converse in real time. \u201cShellie\u201d can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while \u201cArif\u201d is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_21_economy_economic-wellbeing-2023-inflation", "text": "Inflation may have slowed last year, but it continued to deal heavy blows \u2014 some devastating \u2014 on Americans\u2019 livelihoods: Nearly two-thirds of US adults were worse off because of it, and roughly 1 in 6 couldn\u2019t pay all their monthly bills, new Federal Reserve data shows. The Fed on Tuesday released its Economic Well-Being of US Households report for 2023, examining the financial lives of US adults and their families. The report found that 72% of adults surveyed said they were \u201cdoing okay\u201d financially. That\u2019s a tick lower than last year but well below the high of 78% hit in 2021 (and still above the record low of 62% in 2013). Inflation made the financial lives \u201cworse\u201d for 65% of US households, according to the report. Among those, 19% said it was \u201cmuch worse.\u201d The findings were drawn from the Fed\u2019s 11th annual Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, which looks at American\u2019s economic health across a variety of areas, including employment, income, banking and credit, housing, retirement planning, student loans, childcare and even Buy Now, Pay Later usage. But even in a time when broad economic data highlights a remarkably resilient economy \u2014 job growth has been stellar and pay gains have been strong, which have helped fuel spending and keep the economy rolling \u2014 not everyone feels that upbeat. Three-plus years of high inflation have taken their toll on Americans\u2019 wallets and their psyches. Skipping meals, medical care That was especially true in 2022, when US inflation hit 9.1%, its highest annual rate in more than 40 years. As of last month, annual inflation was 3.4%, according to the Consumer Price Index. Incomes grew healthily in 2023, but so did spending, the Fed report showed. Monthly budgets remained tight and more than half of adults didn\u2019t have money left over after paying their expenses. This was especially true for lower-income adults, who reported higher instances of not having enough to eat, not being able to cover bills in full and skipping medical care. Overall, 17% of adults reported they could not pay all their bills in full in the month prior to the survey, which was conducted in October 2023. \u201cThe [Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking] provides valuable insight into the financial conditions of American households,\u201d Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said in a release accompanying the report. \u201cThis perspective continues to help the Federal Reserve better understand how families are coping with the ongoing economic challenges they face.\u201d Perspectives on local, national economy The report showed improvement in people\u2019s feelings about how their local economy fared \u2014 with 42% saying it was \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent,\u201d versus 38% the year before. However, that share is a far cry from how people felt pre-pandemic: In 2019, 63% felt their local economy was in good or excellent health. Zooming out to the national economy, it was a similar story: People\u2019s perceptions improved from 2022 (22% last year, up from 18%), but they remain well below the 50% share notched in 2019. Tuesday\u2019s report showed similar measures of financial resiliency to what was reported in 2022, with 63% of adults saying they\u2019d be able to cover a $400 emergency expense with cash on hand. While that share is below the recent high of 68% hit in 2021, it\u2019s well above what was seen during the past decade. In 2013, only 50% said they could pay for a $400 emergency expense with cash, Fed data shows. Child care expenses eat up budgets While the financial well-being was generally unchanged from 2022 for most Americans, Fed researchers highlighted one particular segment that saw a signifcant downward swing: Parents living with children under the age of 18. The share of respondents from that group who said they were \u201cdoing okay\u201d fell to 64% from 69% in 2022 and from 75% in 2021. For those with younger children, child care expenses were considerable in 2023. Paid child care expenses amounted to 50% to 70% of what parents shelled out for their monthly housing payment, according to the report. Child care expenses, along with homeowners\u2019 insurance, food sufficiency and caregiving responsibilities, were among the new topics discussed in the report. In terms of homeowners\u2019 insurance, the report found that adults who have a higher risk of being financially affected by a natural disaster were less likely to be insured. Nearly 25% of homeowners who live in the South and make under $50,000 a year did not have homeowners\u2019 insurance, the Fed found.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/economy/economic-wellbeing-2023-inflation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}

Danielle Riley Keough, the granddaughter of Elvis and the current owner of the property, was able to get a restraining order against any sale before a court rules on her application for an injunction, according to court documents obtained by CNN. Keough filed a lawsuit this month\u00a0stating that last year, \u201cNaussany Investments & Private Lending LLC presented documents purporting to show that Lisa Marie Presley had borrowed $3.8 million from Naussany Investments and gave a deed of trust encumbering Graceland as security.\u201d Lisa Marie Presley, Elvis\u2019\u00a0daughter and Keough\u2019s mother, died in January 2023. Lisa Marie Presley was the sole heir to Graceland and her father\u2019s estate when he died in 1977, and its overall worth has now reportedly reached into the hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cThese documents are fraudulent,\u201d Keough\u2019s lawsuit alleges. \u201cLisa Marie Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments.\u201d The court document also identified a notary in Florida who said she \u201cnever met Lisa Marie Presley nor notarized any document for her,\u201d despite her name being on loan paperwork. The lawsuit alleges Naussany Investments & Private Lending LLC \u201cappears to be a false entity created for the purpose of defrauding.\u201d CNN emailed Naussany Investments & Private Lending LLC and received an automated reply, \u201cWe are currently out of the office; we will resume normal business hours on Tuesday May 28, 2024.\u201d When CNN attempted to reach Naussany Investments & Private Lending LLC by phone, the number was no longer in service. The business was listed in a court document from Keough\u2019s attorney as being located in Kimberling City, Missouri, but CNN was unable to locate a business in the state of Missouri by that name via the secretary of state\u2019s office. CNN was also unable to locate a business by that name when searching nationwide. \u201cNaussany Investments has now scheduled a non-judicial sale of Graceland based on the fraudulent deed of trust,\u201d the lawsuit reads. \u201cThe sale is scheduled for May 23, 2024.\u00a0This is an action to enjoin the non-judicial sale.\u201d According to court documents obtained by CNN, a temporary restraining order was granted\u00a0on May 15\u00a0prohibiting Naussany Investments & Private Lending LLC from conducting \u201cany non-judicial sale\u201d of the property. CNN has sought comment from representatives and attorneys for Keough. In a statement, Elvis Presley Enterprises, the company that manages Presley\u2019s estate, concurred that Naussany\u2019s claim was illegitimate. \u201cElvis Presley Enterprises can confirm that these claims are fraudulent,\u201d the company said. \u201cThere is no foreclosure sale. Simply put, the counter lawsuit has been filed is to stop the fraud.\u201d Graceland is one of the South\u2019s biggest tourist draws and for\u00a0years\u00a0was the nation\u2019s second-most visited home\u00a0after the White House. In 2020, a Presley executive\u00a0told Rolling Stone\u00a0that Presley\u2019s estate was worth between $400 million and $500 million.

The companies are the latest additions to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act Entity List that restricts the import of goods tied to what the US government has characterized as an ongoing genocide of minorities in China\u2019s Xinjiang region. US officials believe Chinese authorities have established labor camps for Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in China\u2019s western Xinjiang region. Beijing denies any abuses. Many of the cotton companies listed are based outside of Xinjiang but source their cotton from the region, the US Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. The designations help \u201cresponsible companies conduct due diligence so that, together, we can keep the products of forced labor out of our country,\u201d Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary of Homeland Security, said in the statement. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington criticized the move. \u201cThe so-called \u2018Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act\u2019 is just an instrument of a few US politicians to disrupt stability in Xinjiang and contain China\u2019s development,\u201d the spokesperson said.

{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_20_investing_microsoft-stock-record-high-altman-openai", "text": "Microsoft stock reached a record high on Monday after the company said that Sam Altman, former chief executive of OpenAI, will join the company to head its artificial intelligence innovation leg. Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing.

{"id": "2024_05_21_tech_microsoft-ai-copilot-plus-build-2024", "text": "Microsoft\u00a0jumped headfirst into building artificial intelligence directly into its Windows operating system on Monday, announcing new AI computers that could help ramp up flagging PC sales. The developments push the company closer to its long-time goal to \u201cbuild computers that understand us versus us having to understand computers,\u201d CEO Satya Nadella told the audience at the company\u2019s annual developer conference at its Redmond, Washington headquarters. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re really close to that real breakthrough,\u201d he added. The computers, which are packed with processors that power advanced AI tools, come as PC sales have stalled for years. The company hopes the new machines will boost sales and revive excitement, particularly as AI is expected to become increasingly part of everyday life. Microsoft\u2019s new lineup of Copilot+ PCs, which feature a new Surface Pro tablet and Surface laptop, include AI tools that don\u2019t require internet connection \u2013 the AI processing occurs directly on the device The new hardware runs on OpenAI\u2019s new GPT-4o technology, which aims to turn ChatGPT into a digital personal assistant that can engage in real-time, spoken conversations and interact using text and \u201cvision.\u201d Announced last week, it can view screenshots, photos, documents or charts uploaded by users and have a conversation about them. The new hardware also plays up Microsoft\u2019s existing AI assistant called Copilot, which works across various products, including Bing and Microsoft 365. It can help with tasks such as writing, keeping track of\u00a0emails in Outlook or designing\u00a0presentations in PowerPoint. One new feature, called Recall, acts as a personal \u201ctime machine,\u201d allowing users to quickly find things from their computer, such as documents, images and websites. Another allows for real-time translation into more than 40 more languages locally on the device. The company also showed off a new tool called Team Copilot, which serves as a personal assistant, allowing it act as a meeting facilitator to create agendas or take notes on behalf of the whole team, not just an individual user. Microsoft isn\u2019t alone in its AI PC ambition. Dell and Lenovo also recently debuted AI-first PC computers under the Copilot+ AI umbrella, an emerging category that experts widely believe will become the next stage of computing. (Copilot+ is the name of the line of hardware that supports the Copilot software.) Next month, Apple is expected to announce new AI-powered tools for the iPhone and Mac at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. \u201cOver time, AI capability will become a ubiquitous feature, but Microsoft and its partners have made a solid start,\u201d Geoff Blaber, CEO at CCS Insight, told CNN. \u201cThey will need to work hard to ensure that AI becomes a lot more than just a meaningless descriptor with a growing number of features.\u201d Microsoft\u2019s advancements also come at a time when the PC market is ripe for innovation. \u201cThis is a much-needed catalyst,\u201d Blaber added. Although the Surface line is relatively small within the overall PC market, it serves as an aspirational brand and a frontrunner in terms of innovation, according to Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager at market research firm IDC. But Microsoft\u2019s move is more reflective of a greater shift happening in the industry toward AI. In June, Apple will likely introduce generative AI \u2013 artificial intelligence that is capable of creating new output from images to text \u2013 across its iOS and Mac platforms. Reports indicate the company could unveil an AI-powered chatbot that runs on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT technology, the same technology that underpins Microsoft\u2019s new CoPilot+ line. Still, Microsoft has already established itself as an early leader in this space with ChatGPT integrated into key products. And it appears those efforts are paying off. Last month, Microsoft reported quarterly profits of $21.9 billion, up from $18.3 billion a year ago. Revenue grew 17% year-over-year growth to $61.9 billion. Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud business also experienced strong growth \u2013 revenue grew 31% \u2013 boosted by AI tailwinds. The company continues to go all in on AI in other ways, too. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it is pouring $3.3 billion into building a data hub in Wisconsin to train employees and manufacturers on how to best use artificial intelligence. The new center aims to create 2,300 union construction jobs and 2,000 permanent jobs over time, according to Microsoft. It also plans to use the center to train about 100,000 workers across the state.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/tech/microsoft-ai-copilot-plus-build-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_05_16_business_whats-at-stake-in-the-union-election-at-mercedes-benz-plant-in-alabama", "text": "A high-stakes union election is underway at a Mercedes-Benz plant near Tuscaloosa, Alabama, the only plant for the luxury automaker in North America. The fallout will be significant whether the workers at Mercedes-Benz vote to join the United Auto Workers union or not. The UAW is hoping to carry its strong momentum right now, as its decision to use a \u201cstand up strike\u201d strategy hitting the Big Three automakers all at once brought unprecedented attention and record contracts for workers. And last month, it won a union election at a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, its first victory in three attempts to organize the factory. Winning the Alabama vote would mean the UAW\u2019s biggest push to grow its membership in decades will keep going. The UAW watched for decades as non-unionized factories owned by companies from Kia to Toyota to Tesla to Rivian popped up across the country, especially in the southern United States. But under relatively new UAW president Shawn Fain, the strategy has changed. In an interview with Car and Driver, Fain said the profit margins for the Japanese, Korean and German automakers were \u201cobscenely more gross than they were at the Big Three, and yet their workers get less.\u201d \u201cI truly believe we\u2019re going to see a huge shift this year. I think we\u2019re gonna win in the South,\u201d he said in the interview. But a loss could stall those efforts \u2014 and reaffirm the South\u2019s reputation as a union-free, corporate-friendly region. In November 2023, the UAW said it began an effort to organize workers at 13 non-union auto US factories. The effort included three US-based electric vehicle makers \u2014 Tesla, Rivian and Lucid \u2014 as well as 10 foreign automakers that build cars in the US \u2014 BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Mercedes, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Volvo. The Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance, Alabama, near Tuscaloosa, has about 6,000 hourly workers. Voting is set to end Friday morning. Mercedes\u2019 response In a statement, Mercedes-Benz US International said it \u201cfully respects our Team Members\u2019 choice whether to unionize and we look forward to participating in the election process to ensure every Team Member has a chance to cast their own secret-ballot vote, as well as having access to the information necessary to make an informed choice.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean Mercedes would let its workers unionize without putting up a fight, as the company has used language and tactics common to corporations that are resistant to organizing efforts. \u201cWe believe open and direct communication with our Team Members is the best path forward to ensure continued success,\u201d the statement said. In a separate statement, MBUSI said that it \u201chas a proven record of competitively compensating Team Members and providing many additional benefits.\u201d And the company is allegedly pushing back against unionization efforts in other ways, according to six unfair labor practice charges filed by the UAW. The National Labor Relations Board said it is investigating six unfair labor practice charges filed by the UAW against Mercedes-Benz since March. Those charges allege Mercedes has disciplined employees for discussing unionization during work, prohibited distribution of union materials, surveilled employees, and forced employees to attend \u201ccaptive audience meetings,\u201d which is a mandatory meeting during work meant to discourage unionizing. Mercedes-Benz US International denied these claims, and said in a statement it \u201chas not interfered with or retaliated against any Team Member in their right to pursue union representation.\u201d It continued, \u201cWe do not believe these claims have merit and we look forward to presenting our case to the NLRB.\u201d Building off momentum Last month, hourly workers at Volkswagen\u2019s plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, overwhelmingly voted to join the UAW \u2014 73% of the 3,600 workers at the plant who cast ballots had voted to join the union. The victory didn\u2019t come easy for the UAW. Volkswagen didn\u2019t win until its third union drive, said Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at\u00a0Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations\u2019 Buffalo office. And this is the Mercedes plant\u2019s first strong push. \u201cIt\u2019s not a catastrophe if they don\u2019t win (the first time). Primarily because they\u2019re facing a very active Mercedes Benz trying to block them from organizing, you got governors in the South trying to block them from organizing, and they don\u2019t have the same track record or history or infrastructure in Alabama,\u201d Wheaton said. Even more broadly, unions have enjoyed a successful run \u2014 they won\u00a0pay increases of 10% or more\u00a0for nearly a million union members last year, according to an analysis by CNN.\u00a0Strikes\u00a0were at a decade high in 2023, and organizing activity also increased. \u201cLabor has something to bring to the table. You see the successes at the bargaining table. It makes people more aware that the union may have something to offer,\u201d Wheaton said. Why this election matters This election has huge implications for the UAW\u2019s organizing efforts beyond the Big Three unionized automakers \u2013 GM, Ford and Stellantis. The South has a much lower level of union representation than workers in industrial regions in the North. But a labor expert says a loss would not be the end of the UAW\u2019s efforts in organizing in the South. \u201cIt\u2019s not horrible if they lose, because it gives the UAW the chance to see where they\u2019re at. They can gauge how much support they have,\u201d Wheaton said. There are about 150,000 workers at nonunion auto plants in the United States today. That\u2019s roughly the same amount of workers represented at the Big Three. The UAW is at the point where more than a majority of autos that are sold in the US are assembled and produced in plants that don\u2019t have UAW representation, which weakens their bargaining power at the Big Three, Harry Katz, professor of collective bargaining at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations said. Since 1990, the South\u2019s share of auto jobs has doubled from around 15% to 30% today, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Meanwhile, the Midwest\u2019s share has declined from 60% to 45%. \u201cSo much of auto production is occurring in plants not represented by the UAW. The management then threatens to move production to those other sites,\u201d Katz said. A lot at stake Katz said a win would not be a bellwether event, and the consequences of the union losing the vote will be even greater than the positive outcome if they win, he said. \u201cIt would be an important victory, but it wouldn\u2019t signal that there\u2019s necessarily signs that unions are going to have a cakewalk, an easy path to winning in either the other transplants or in many other organizations,\u2019\u201d Katz said. Though a union win could generate momentum, it doesn\u2019t mean a victory will mean other plants can overcome management opposition at other foreign-owned plants. Non-union automakers have already begun their response to the big union victories thus far. Toyota, Honda and Hyundai all announced raises for their US factory workers within two weeks of tentative contract agreements with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. And workers at those plants might be content with the non-union status they\u2019ve worked under already. \u201cThose plants\u2019 management has a lot of communication engagement strategies that \u2013rightfully or not \u2013 seem to satisfy the worker,\u201d Katz said, who said those workers are already earning significantly more than their local labor markets. And there is pressure from local politicians as well. Six southern governors from Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas issued a joint statement in April discouraging the union campaign, warning it could put workers\u2019 jobs, as well as the auto industry in the South, in jeopardy. The statement came a day before workers at Volkswagen voted on joining the UAW. \u201cThe reality is companies have choices when it comes to where to invest and bring jobs and opportunity. We have worked tirelessly on behalf of our constituents to bring good-paying jobs to our states. These jobs have become part of the fabric of the automotive manufacturing industry,\u201d the statement said. CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore and Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_21_cars_nissan-evs-mississippi-factory", "text": "Nissan is postponing a push to build new electric vehicles at its Canton, Mississippi, factory as sales of EVs are now growing more slowly than many industry experts had expected. EV sales in the US grew 2.6 % in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, according to Kelley Blue Book. First quarter EV sales last year had outpaced 2022\u2019s by a stunning 46.4%. Many in the industry had expected interest in EVs to accelerate, not slow down. But consumers are concerned about the high prices of EVs and worried about being able to charge them easily, according to the consumer survey company JD Power. These concerns have led to recent drops in customer consideration of EVs. Currently, Nissan sells two EV models in the US, the Leaf compact hatchback and the Ariya SUV, but had announced plans to build five new EV models in Canton including two originally scheduled for production in 2025. The new models were set to include both Nissan and Infiniti vehicles. Infiniti is Nissan\u2019s luxury brand. Nissan is delaying plans to actually begin producing the vehicles in Mississippi. \u201cWe are adjusting the timeline for the introduction of these five new models to ensure we bring the vehicles to the market at the right time, prioritizing in line with customer demand and maximizing the opportunity for our brands and supplier partners,\u201d Nissan said in a statement emailed to CNN. These latest delays were previously reported by the industry newspaper Automotive News. Nissan still plans to offer a total of 19 EV models globally by 2030, a spokesperson said. Nissan previously announced it would invest $500 million in the factory to prepare it build the new electric vehicles. The factory in Canton currently employs roughly 5,000 workers and makes the Nissan Altima sedan Frontier, Titan, and Titan XD pickups.  Other automakers have also made moves to slow production of new EVs and EV batteries citing concerns about slowing consumer adoption. Last year, GM slowed down a planned ramp up in production of its Silverado EV pickup.

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/22/2024", "section": "business"}}

With Gruenberg remaining\u00a0until a successor is named,\u00a0there won\u2019t be\u00a0a situation where Vice Chair Travis Hill, a Republican appointee, automatically becomes chair, leaving the agency deadlocked with one other Republican and two Democratic members on the FDIC\u2019s board of directors. That would have likely stalled significant and controversial banking regulations, such as ramped-up capital requirements, from taking effect. Michel said the administration is grateful for \u201chis willingness to stay at FDIC until his successor is confirmed in order to continue to safeguard our nation\u2019s financial stability during this time of transition.\u201d Sen. Tim Scott, the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, slammed Gruenberg\u2019s decision not to resign immediately as well as Democrats for not putting more pressure on him to do so. \u201cThis draw-it-out strategy makes it clear that this administration is prioritizing their political agenda over protecting workers,\u201d Scott said in a statement. The FDIC commissioned a report by law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, which ultimately spurred Gruenberg\u2019s resignation. It confirmed the findings of a November Wall Street Journal investigation revealing a long-standing problematic culture. It did not find that Gruenberg alone was responsible for the issues described in depth in the report based on interviews with over 500 employees. However, it documented several instances where Gruenberg lashed out at subordinates \u201cparticularly when being delivered bad news or conveyed views with which he disagrees.\u201d That caused staffers to delay delivering news they feared would upset him. Gruenberg\u2019s temperament \u201cmay hinder his ability to establish trust and confidence in leading meaningful culture change,\u201d the report added. Gruenberg testified before lawmakers last week in a previously scheduled hearing with other top financial regulators, saying he takes \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for the findings of the report. \u201cI also acknowledge my own failures as Chairman, both in failing to recognize how my temperament in meetings impacted others and for not having identified deeper cultural issues at the FDIC sooner,\u201d he said. The FDIC declined to comment beyond Gruenberg\u2019s statement on Monday. A tricky political manuever While most Democrats stopped short of calling for Gruenberg to resign or be replaced, many expressed outrage at the mid-May hearings in the House and Senate that Gruenberg testified at. \u201cI\u2019m pissed off\u2026 If it was me in my office, I\u2019d probably be run out,\u201d said Rep. Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat during the hearing. \u201cIt just saddens me greatly,\u201d he added, referring to the findings of the independent report. However, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren labeled the calls Gruenberg received to resign \u201cpurely political exercise.\u201d \u201cYour resignation would do nothing to improve the culture of the FDIC but it would give Republicans a veto over bank policy,\u201d she said at the Senate hearing where Gruenberg testified. For her, it appeared it would be sufficient for him to see through implementing all the recommendations of the report, which he said he would.
