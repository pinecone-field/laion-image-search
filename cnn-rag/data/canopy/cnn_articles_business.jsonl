The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_economy_us-new-home-sales-may", "text": "Sales of newly built homes dropped last month as mortgage rates remained elevated. New home sales, which make up only about 10% of the market, fell 11.3% in May from the prior month, to 619,000, according to government data released Wednesday. That was the steepest monthly decline since September 2022 and marks the lowest level since November. May\u2019s level was below the 647,500 economists projected in a FactSet poll. Mortgage rates soared to the highest level of the year in early May and have since trended down. Borrowing costs are expected to ease this year, but not by much: Federal Reserve officials penciled in just one rate cut this year. Inflation will need to continue to drift closer toward the Fed\u2019s 2% target for the central bank to begin cutting interest rates, and some officials have said it\u2019s possible the Fed may not end up cutting at all this year. High interest rates, and expectations that they\u2019ll remain elevated for longer than expected, are weighing on America\u2019s homebuilders. US homebuilder sentiment soured in May for the second month in a row, according to the latest National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index out last week. That\u2019s also taking a toll on the construction of new US homes. Housing starts fell 5.5% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.28 million units, the lowest level since 2020, also registering well below economists\u2019 expectations. Building permits, seen as a bellwether of future construction, dipped 3.8%. \u201cPersistently high mortgage rates are keeping many prospective buyers on the sidelines,\u201d NAHB chairman Carl Harris said in a release. \u201cHome builders are also dealing with higher rates for construction and development loans, chronic labor shortages and a dearth of buildable lots.\u201d Housing shortage persists. Here\u2019s what the US government is doing The US housing market has for decades grappled with a chronic lack of homes available for sale, which has put some upward pressure on home prices. High prices and elevated mortgage rates, coupled with the persistent housing shortage, have undermined this year\u2019s critical spring homebuying season. US home prices rose in May for the eleventh consecutive month to $419,300, a record high on data going back to 1999, the National Association of Realtors said last week. While that means Americans are stuck dealing with low housing affordability, it\u2019s also proving to be a headache for the Fed: Inflation overall has eased substantially since reaching a four-decade high two years ago, but shelter costs have remained stubbornly elevated. It is effectively making the final stretch of the Fed\u2019s inflation battle more difficult. Fed officials, including Fed chief Jerome Powell, have said that it\u2019s only a matter of time until declining rents show up in official government measures of inflation. Renters are very much still struggling in today\u2019s tough US housing market. The Biden administration has laid out its own solutions to the country\u2019s housing crisis. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday announced $100 million in funding over the next three years \u201cto support the financing of affordable housing,\u201d according to a release. On Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris and Housing and Urban Development Acting Secretary Adrianne Todman announced $85\u00a0million in grant funding toward a housing program that \u201caims to identify and remove barriers to affordable housing production and preservation, and lower housing costs.\u201d \u201cHousing costs are a particular pain point for American households,\u201d Lael Brainard, director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, said last week at an event in Washington. Brainard touted the Biden administration\u2019s cap on annual rent increases for the 2 million households in \u201clow-income housing tax credit\u201d units and a reduction in Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance premiums that took effect in the spring, which she said has helped nearly 700,000 homeowners save roughly $900 annually.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/economy/us-new-home-sales-may/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}

The company, owned by Europe\u2019s richest man Bernard Arnault, said Thursday that it had bought a majority stake in Chez L\u2019ami Louis, a 100-year-old restaurant in central Paris, described by LVMH as an \u201cauthentic Parisian gem.\u201d \u201cLVMH will work to preserve the unique character and family identity of the restaurant and continue to support its French savoir-faire and expertise,\u201d it said in a press release. It did not disclose the size of its stake nor the value of the deal. The classic bistro \u2014 famed for its roast chicken, mounds of thin, crispy fries, and plates of sizzling snails \u2014 has hosted Bill Clinton and Martin Scorsese, as well as David and Victoria Beckham, according to a source familiar with the deal. The source requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. If that wasn\u2019t endorsement enough, the restaurant has also earned Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s seal of approval. Her lifestyle company Goop describes Chez L\u2019ami Louis on its website as \u201cone of the best, most venerable bistros in Paris.\u201d \u201cIt is small and wood-paneled, with an ancient oven and a sick wine list,\u201d Goop gushed. LVMH said in its press release that the bistro sources its produce from small breeders and market gardeners \u201cwho have been loyal to the restaurant for several generations.\u201d CNN could not reach Chez L\u2019ami Louis for comment Friday. The essence of Paris Arnault has also dined at the Parisian restaurant, the source close to the deal told CNN, adding that the billionaire is passionate about preserving parts of the city\u2019s cultural \u201cidentity and expression.\u201d LVMH and Arnault pledged \u20ac200 million ($226 million) in 2019 to help rebuild Notre Dame after fire devastated the 850-year-old church.

In recent years, LVMH, which owns Dior and Louis Vuitton among other designer brands, has beefed up its portfolio of hospitality venues. In 2019, the company acquired Belmond, which owns hotels and organizes luxury rail and river cruises, in a $3.2 billion deal.

{"id": "2024_06_26_tech_uae-ai-minister-omar-al-olama-hnk-spc-intl", "text": "The world\u2019s first minister dedicated to developing artificial intelligence (AI) strategy is already becoming embroiled in a global power struggle for tech supremacy. In April, Microsoft (MSFT) announced a $1.5 billion investment in G42, an AI group based in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and chaired by an influential member of the ruling royal family. The deal, which analysts say was motivated by the Biden administration\u2019s desire to limit Beijing\u2019s influence in the region as the US battles to maintain its lead over China in the AI race, firmly pulled the firm into the orbit of the United States. \u201cI think the UAE and the US really see eye to eye with regards to how these technologies are pushed forward,\u201d UAE AI Minister Omar Al Olama, who was appointed in 2017, told CNN in a recent video interview. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see more alignment there.\u201d G42, a holding firm, is comprised of seven companies that work across data centers, energy, healthcare, surveillance and biotechnology. Its controlling shareholder is Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who also serves as the UAE national security adviser. The UAE is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of fossil fuels, and Abu Dhabi sees its AI push as crucial for diversifying away from oil. AI could contribute $96 billion to the UAE economy by 2030, equivalent to nearly 14% of its gross domestic product, according to a report by PwC Middle East. \u201cWe want to ensure that we are at the frontier of the technology, and that\u2019s why we work with partners around the frontier,\u201d said Olama, \u201cand play by the rules that are set by the market leaders.\u201d Olama, whose ministerial remit includes digital economy and remote work applications, wants to make the UAE a global leader in artificial intelligence by 2031. The UAE has laid out a national strategy to get there. Its objectives include deploying AI in priority sectors such as energy and logistics, developing an ecosystem and attracting talent. The country is putting public officials through AI training, and Dubai is aiming to teach a million citizens effective prompt engineering, instructing AI models to produce high-quality output. As of September, the Gulf country had 120,000 people working on AI or related industries, up from 30,000 two years earlier, Al Olama has said. Choosing sides Sometimes, the country has had to prioritize its relationship with the US over Washington\u2019s rivals. A US Congressional committee called on the Commerce Department in January to investigate G42\u2019s links to Chinese military companies and intelligence services (G42 denied any such connections), and the Microsoft investment required G42 to cut ties with Chinese hardware suppliers, reportedly including Huawei, in favor of US companies. \u201cThe US does not shy away from saying that \u2018on this technology specifically you need to choose sides,\u2019\u201d said Olama. The UAE has historically performed a balancing act with its foreign policy. It cooperates with the US on a range of issues, including defense, and in recent years the US has sold tens of billions of dollars of military equipment to the Gulf nation. The Biden administration, which sees maintaining a lead in AI as crucial for its future economic success and national security, has implemented a series of measures including export controls on AI and semiconductor technologies to slow China\u2019s advancement in the industry. Washington has also limited the sale of sophisticated US chips to ensure China doesn\u2019t use Middle Eastern nations as a back door to access the newest AI technology, according to Reuters. Nvidia, the world\u2019s third biggest company after Microsoft and Apple, said in an August 2023 regulatory filing that the US government had informed the chipmaker that some of its products would face additional licensing requirements for \u201ccertain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\u201d Some US politicians have raised concerns that they don\u2019t have enough details about the deal between G42 and Microsoft and that US technology might be vulnerable to Chinese espionage in the UAE. The country has ties to Beijing, too, and China is a key trade partner. Olama insists the UAE is a trustworthy partner. \u201cI really don\u2019t think that there is any risk, especially since there\u2019s a lot of cutting-edge American technology that is in the UAE,\u201d said Olama, adding that he was speaking in his personal capacity, not as a government official. \u2018A leading tech power\u2019 In late 2023, Abu Dhabi\u2019s government-backed Technology Innovation Institute unveiled a large language model (LLM), the technology behind generative AI chatbots, called Falcon10B. It outperformed offerings from Google and Meta by some metrics. \u201cThe UAE put a stake in the ground in the AI race with Falcon,\u201d James Lewis, who studies technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington DC-based think tank, told CNN. In October 2023, a collaboration between Abu Dhabi\u2019s Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, Silicon Valley-based Cerebras Systems and Inception, a subsidiary of G42, produced Jais, a generative AI model trained on Arabic as well as English. Its creators said it could pave the way for LLMs in other languages that are \u201cunderrepresented in mainstream AI.\u201d Unlike ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini, Falcon and Jais are open-source, which means their code is available for anyone to use or change. By opening up the technology, Abu Dhabi is positioning itself as an ally to developing nations that don\u2019t have the resources to build their own AI tools. \u201cWe know that not every country can develop these systems or these tools,\u201d said Olama. \u201cSo, we want to ensure that we\u2019re able to develop it for them.\u201d Some analysts say the UAE\u2019s vast oil wealth will be key in developing hugely expensive AI infrastructure. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a financial story,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cIt gives them an edge in terms of being one of the leading tech powers in the future.\u201d As fears grow about the potential risks of AI, Olama has called for a global coalition to regulate the development and use of the technology. The stakes are high. In March, a report commissioned by the US State Department warned that the most advanced AI systems could, in a worst-case scenario, \u201cpose an extinction-level threat to the human species.\u201d Olama has some specific concerns. He expects deepfakes will cause a \u201cfundamental truth crisis\u201d and could drive a \u201cpolitical crisis.\u201d He\u2019s also worried that AI could make it easier to create biotech weapons. \u201cI try not to be a fear mongerer,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there are very few guardrails in place to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/tech/uae-ai-minister-omar-al-olama-hnk-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}

Homeowners in America aren\u2019t the only ones struggling with an unaffordable housing market. Renters are also bearing the brunt. A report from Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies released last week showed that both homeowners and renters in recent years have become increasingly burdened by climbing housing costs. The report, based on an analysis of existing data, said that nearly one in four households that own a home \u201care now stretched worryingly thin.\u201d The cost burdens are even worse for renters. \u201cFor renters, the landscape is even more challenging,\u201d the Harvard report said. \u201cWhile rents have been rising faster than incomes for decades, the pandemic-era rent surge produced an unprecedented affordability crisis.\u201d Renters who spend more than half of their household income on housing and utilities rose in 2022 to a new record high of 12.1 million, up 1.5 million from levels seen before the Covid-19 pandemic. Allocating such a high proportion of household income to rent makes them vulnerable to becoming unhoused if they face an unexpected financial issue, such as an unexpected medical bill. That\u2019s all part of a broader struggle in the US housing market, and recent data shows that it hasn\u2019t gotten any better. A persistent lack of homes available for sale is spurring bidding wars. Elevated mortgage rates are keeping sellers and some buyers on the sidelines. \u201cHousing costs are a particular pain point for American households,\u201d Lael Brainard, director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, said Thursday at an event in Washington. \u201cCongress really does need to act here,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Senate could act tomorrow and we would have tax credits for 200,000 additional affordable units,\u201d referring to a bill that recently passed the US House. Speaking at an event hosted by the Urban Institute, Brainard outlined the Biden administration\u2019s attempts to fix America\u2019s housing market, such as a cap on annual rent increases for the 2 million households in \u201clow-income housing tax credit\u201d units and a reduction in Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance premiums that took effect in the spring. \u201cAlready, nearly 700,000 homeowners are saving roughly $900 annually as a result of the Administration\u2019s reduction in mortgage interest premiums for FHA-backed loans,\u201d Brainard said. The Harvard report said that \u201cstate and local experimentation with regulatory reforms and incentives will incrementally add affordable homes\u201d and that there\u2019s a pressing \u201cneed for down payment support and access to low-interest mortgage products to close racial gaps and put homeownership within reach for households with modest incomes.\u201d Apple\u2019s new China problem: ChatGPT is banned there Apple is banking on its upcoming AI features to boost iPhone sales especially in China, where demand has been lagging. But there\u2019s a problem: ChatGPT \u2014 soon to be integrated into Siri \u2014 is banned in China, reports my colleague Samantha Murphy Kelly. In a presentation earlier this month, Apple (AAPL) showed off its proprietary technology called Apple Intelligence to power compelling new AI\u00a0features\u00a0and announced a\u00a0partnership with OpenAI\u00a0to also use its viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity. (When Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry, ChatGPT can step in.) The move signaled how Apple is trying to expedite the latest buzzy technology at a time when tech rivals, such as Microsoft, Google, Meta and Samsung, have already found their AI\u00a0footing. A deal with OpenAI could help Apple close the gap. But China is one of the first countries in the world to regulate the generative AI technology that powers these popular services. In August, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s top internet watchdog, rolled out new guidelines for the industry, requiring companies to seek approval before deployment. The organization has approved more than 100 AI models as of March, all from Chinese companies. Read more here. Up Next Monday:\u00a0Fed Governor Christopher Waller delivers remarks.

The $3 trillion tech darling has seduced investors, and its stock has risen about 750% since the beginning of 2023. But the past few days suggest that the spell the company cast over Wall Street has broken as a sudden wave of volatility briefly sent shares of the company skidding lower. Nvidia\u2019s stock bounced back Tuesday, yet investors have been reminded of a potentially bubble-bursting truth: You can fly too close to the sun. What\u2019s happening: Nvidia has had a whiplash-inducing few months. The chipmaker added a trillion dollars to its market cap, growing to $3 trillion in just 30 days from April 2024. For context, it took Warren Buffett about 60 years to build Berkshire Hathaway into a nearly trillion dollar company. On June 18, Nvidia\u2019s market value soared to $3.34 trillion, surpassing Microsoft\u2019s to become the world\u2019s most valuable company, and the stock seemed to be speeding up a one-way road to the top. Why it matters: Nvidia is solely responsible for about 35% of the S&P 500\u2019s total gains this year, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank. That makes it one of the most influential companies ever listed on the S&P 500. That\u2019s why Nvidia\u2019s plunge last week and on Monday was so jarring to investors. The stock shed a whopping $430 billion in value over the course of just three days. \u201cFirst it was the Magnificent Seven. Then it was the Fab Four.

Nvidia has been like a habit investors have been unable to shake. \u201cOne question I get a lot is \u2018why don\u2019t I just put all my money in Nvidia.\u2019\u00a0I cannot really argue with that question,\u201d wrote Louis Navellier of Navellier & Associates in a recent note to investors. Then came the drop. \u201cWhat we see with Nvidia is typical volatility, which is expected when a stock rises as quickly as Nvidia\u2019s did,\u201d Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at trading platform CMC Markets, told CNN on Tuesday. But typical volatility can have seismic repercussions when it comes to a stock as all-consuming as Nvidia. Emerging from the cave: The stock was the second best performer in the entire S&P 500 Tuesday, gaining nearly 7%. That pushed its market cap back above the $3 trillion mark again. Still, the damage may already be done. \u201cNvidia\u2019s rich valuation is ludicrous \u2014 its market cap now exceeds that of the entire FTSE 100, yet its sales are less than 4% of that index,\u201d said Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO and founding partner of Bowersock Capital Partners, with reference to the 100 biggest stocks listed in London. Analysts at The Carlyle Group say that while artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the world around us, the Nvidia stock bubble will eventually burst. \u201cThe market seems quite adept at identifying transformational change but gets fixated on the hardware that facilitates it rather than the downstream value that hardware ultimately unlocks,\u201d wrote Jason Thomas, Carlyle\u2019s head of global research and investment strategy in a recent note. Yes, but: Still, enthusiasm remains high. \u201cThe fundamentals behind Nvidia\u2019s growth remain the same,\u201d Neil Roarty, analyst at investment platform Stocklytics wrote on Tuesday. \u201cIf you believe that the AI technology its chips are powering will completely recalibrate the global economy \u2014 and many do \u2014 then a $3 trillion market cap suddenly looks considerably more reasonable.\u201d The stock is up another 2.3% in premarket trading Wednesday. Levi\u2019s under fire after supplier laid off hundreds of workers Levi\u2019s is a global brand that\u00a0says\u00a0it has always stood up for \u201cwhat\u2019s right.\u201d But its claim to be an ethical company is now in question following the release of a report from an independent labor monitoring group. Critics accuse Levi\u2019s (LEVI) of ignoring its own labor standards after it continued working with a factory in Turkey that fired around 400 people last year after they joined a union and went on strike over pay and working conditions. Turkey is a critical link in the global supply chain for apparel. The country exported around $30 billion worth of apparel and textiles last year, according to the Istanbul Exporters\u2019 Association, a clothing industry group. In a statement to CNN, Levi\u2019s said it had \u201ca\u00a0longstanding commitment to supporting safe, productive workplaces for workers, and we take any allegations of efforts to curtail freedom of association extremely seriously.\u201d It said it continued sourcing jeans from the factory despite the mass firings, to avoid further job losses, but the continuation of its relationship with the supplier depends \u201con management\u2019s fulfillment of a detailed remediation plan that addresses freedom of association, working hours, and health and safety.\u201d Read more here.  \u2018Months to correct, if not years\u2019: Car dealerships and customers feel the impact as CDK outage drags on A CDK Global system outage has affected nearly every aspect of the Mazda dealership in Seekonk, Massachusetts, where Ryan Callahan is general sales manager.

{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_business_harvard-antisemitism-anti-palestinian-task-force", "text": "Two presidential task forces formed to recommend how Harvard can combat antisemitism and anti-Muslim, anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian activity on campus have spoken: Harvard needs to act now. The two groups issued preliminary reports on Wednesday aimed at restoring the university\u2019s trust with students, faculty and the broader community. The recommendations come after a string of disruptive and, at times, violent campus protests. And they follow a rise in hateful speech and activity against Jews, Palestinians, Muslims and Arabs after Hamas\u2019 deadly October 7 attack on Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza that has killed tens of thousands. After 85 listening sessions that included close to 900 members of the Harvard community,  the task forces said Harvard\u2019s students and faculty feel the university has fallen short of its stated values, particularly respecting differences and diversity, in its response to the protests and upheaval on campus. \u201cThe situation over the past year has been quite grave, and unless we take significant steps forward by the beginning of the coming academic year, we could be in a position similar to last year, which we want to prevent,\u201d said Derek Penslar, a Jewish history professor and co-chair of\u00a0Harvard\u2019s task force on combating antisemitism. Harvard needs to do more work to promote diversity education and promote multiple perspectives on campus, the task force chairs recommended. \u201cIntentional engagement with diversity is a very important skill that all our students should have, regardless of what school they attend,\u201d said Ali Asani, a Middle Eastern studies professor and co-chair of the task force on combating anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, and anti-Palestinian bias. \u201cNot having those skills and the tools to engage has serious consequences for our world as it leads to polarization.\u201d The anti-Muslim, anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian bias task force broadly recommended promoting safety, representation, freedom of expression, transparency and relationships among affinity groups among other areas. The antisemitism task force sought to get Harvard to clarify its values, act against discrimination and hate, improve the university\u2019s disciplinary process, promote dialogue and training on the topic and support Jewish life on campus. Among the suggestions, the task forces said Harvard should publicly condemn all forms of discrimination and stay out of topics that don\u2019t concern the university. Harvard last month said it will no longer weigh in on public matters that don\u2019t impact the Ivy League school\u2019s core function. The groups said Harvard should review its Middle East academic program, create a prayer space for Muslims, work to prevent doxxing and add combatting antisemitism to the purview of the university\u2019s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion office. Of particular concern for the task force on antisemitism was the sentiment that complaints about anti-Jewish hate and activity on campus were going unheard. The group said that the university failed to follow up on many complaints, and the consequences for some of those actions was insufficient. Alan Garber, Harvard\u2019s interim president, said he appreciated the recommendations and the task forces\u2019 candor. \u201cThe work ahead of us will require a concerted effort,\u201d Garber said. \u201cWe will commence detailed review and implementation of the shorter-term recommendations over the summer. Those that are longer-term will be developed, refined, and implemented in due course.\u201d Harvard has been under particular scrutiny for its response to rising incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia on campus. The Anti-Defamation League gave Harvard a failing grade on antisemitism in a recent report. And the House Education Committee lambasted the university for its response to a subpoena seeking information on how it handled campus protests. Former Harvard President Claudine Gay resigned earlier this year following her testimony to the House committee, and an ensuing plagiarism scandal.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/business/harvard-antisemitism-anti-palestinian-task-force/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_business_levis-mass-layoffs-turkey-strike", "text": "Levi\u2019s is a global brand that says it has always stood up for \u201cwhat\u2019s right.\u201d But its claim to be an ethical company is now in question following the release of a report from an independent labor monitoring group. Critics accuse Levi\u2019s (LEVI) of ignoring its own labor standards after it continued working with a factory in Turkey that fired around 400 people last year after they joined a union and went on strike over pay and working conditions. Turkey is a critical link in the global supply chain for apparel. The country exported around $30 billion worth of apparel and textiles last year, according to the Istanbul Exporters\u2019 Association, a clothing industry group. One player in the industry is Ozak Tekstil\u2019s factory in Turkey\u2019s Sanliurfa region, which exclusively makes jeans for Levi\u2019s. Ozak Tekstil also produces clothing in its other factories in Turkey for brands such as Zara, Hugo Boss, Guess, Mango and Ralph Lauren, according to the report by the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC), published Friday. Seher Gulel worked in quality control at the factory before she was fired in late November. She was paid Turkey\u2019s minimum wage, she told CNN, which at the time was about $15 a day. Pressure, bullying and insults by managers were frequent, she says, and excessively long days were common. She would often work from 8 a.m. until midnight or even into the early morning hours \u2014 even though, under Turkish law, workers should not work more than 11 hours in a day. \u201cThe (illegal) overtime problem was constant,\u201d she said. Ozak Tekstil said its overtime hours and payments were within the law. Months into the job Gulel had had enough. She joined a new union, Birtek-Sen, switching from another one, which she says was ineffective and \u201calways pro-boss.\u201d (The union denies this). Within 10 days of joining Birtek-Sen, she was fired for what Ozak Tekstil called \u201cquality control errors.\u201d Her dismissal provided the spark for hundreds of workers at the factory to walk off the job, according to the WRC report and Gulel. The workers had been on strike for a little over two weeks when Ozak Tekstil made good its threat to fire those who refused to return to work. Roughly 400 were dismissed in mid-December \u2014 almost half the factory\u2019s staff. \u201cWe were looking for justice,\u201d Gulel told CNN. \u201cBut we got injustice. Ozak Tekstil told CNN it had terminated the workers \u201cas a last resort\u201d when they declined an invitation to return to work.\u00a0It also said that, while a Turkish law enshrines the right to strike, under the same law, Birtek-Sen didn\u2019t have enough members to collectively bargain and organize a strike. \u201cSince the day the factory was founded, workers\u2019 right to unionize has always been respected,\u201d Ozak Tekstil said. However, the WRC report says: \u201cThe labor law also flatly prohibits employers from firing workers for striking, even in the case of an illegal strike, unless the country\u2019s labor courts have first ruled that the strike in question is unlawful.\u201d A court did rule that the strike had been illegal but the ruling didn\u2019t come until five months after the firings. In an email between Levi\u2019s and the Birtek-Sen union, shared with CNN by the WRC, Levi\u2019s acknowledged that the mass firings violated its own supplier code of conduct, which states that its factories \u201cshall respect the right to free association and the right to organize and bargain collectively without unlawful interference.\u201d Importantly for Gulel\u2019s case, the code also dictates that suppliers must ensure workers who join the union \u201care not the object of discrimination, harassment, or punitive disciplinary actions.\u201d In that email, dated December 22, 2023, the company also said it had instructed Ozak Tekstil to reinstate the workers. If it refused, \u201cwe will be forced to take the appropriate next steps to uphold workers\u2019 rights,\u201d Levi\u2019s wrote. \u2018Meaningless\u2019 standards But Ozak Tekstil didn\u2019t do what Levi\u2019s was asking. It did not reinstate all of the fired workers. The company told CNN it had offered most of the workers their jobs back (but without the right to continue with the strike), but only a handful had accepted the offer. On April 1, months after the mass dismissals, Levi\u2019s wrote to the WRC reconfirming that its code of conduct had been violated but adding that it was \u201cless clear that exiting Ozak and potentially putting an additional 400 people out of work in the process is how we should proceed.\u201d This is how WRC executive director Scott Nova summarized the situation: \u201cThe factory said no, and Levi\u2019s in the end said, \u2018well, okay, we\u2019ll give you business anyway.\u2019\u201d He called the firings \u201cone of the most brazen, outrageous violations\u201d of workers\u2019 right to strike that he\u2019d seen anywhere in years. \u201cThe message Levi\u2019s is sending to all of its suppliers globally \u2014 of which there are many hundreds \u2014 is that Levi\u2019s labor standards are meaningless. But even though Levi\u2019s says factories have to respect the rights of workers, what Levi\u2019s really wants is cheap blue jeans produced quickly regardless of the consequences for the workers who make them,\u201d Nova said. In a statement to CNN, Levi\u2019s said it had \u201ca\u00a0longstanding commitment to supporting safe, productive workplaces for workers, and we take any allegations of efforts to curtail freedom of association extremely seriously.\u201d It said it continued sourcing jeans from the factory despite the mass firings, to avoid further job losses, but the continuation of its relationship with the supplier depends \u201con management\u2019s fulfillment of a detailed remediation plan that addresses freedom of association, working hours, and health and safety.\u201d As for Gulel\u2019s allegations of excessive overtime and abusive managers at the factory, Levi\u2019s did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Hugo Boss told CNN it was \u201cmonitoring the accusations\u201d at the Levi\u2019s plant in Sanliurfa. \u201cOzak has confirmed that it complies with our social standards, which are mandatory for a business relationship with\u00a0Hugo Boss, and that a trade union has been active in the company for over 10 years,\u201d said Carolin Westermann, a spokesperson for the German brand. \u2018Blacklisted\u2019 While most fired workers received a severance payment, many are now struggling to find a job \u2014 and that may be due to something else they received from Ozak Tekstil: an effective black mark in a publicly accessible government database. Gulel has been out of work for seven months and former union rep Funda Bakis, who was fired in mid-December, for more than six. They both say they\u2019re now \u201cblacklisted.\u201d According to Gulel\u2019s dismissal notice seen by CNN, the official reason for her firing stated in the database is \u201ccode 50,\u201d which means the employee \u201cendangers the safety of the job due to (their) own will or negligence, causes damage and loss to the machines \u2026 to the extent that (they) cannot repay with the amount of (their) 30-day wage.\u201d As for Bakis, she was given \u201ccode 46,\u201d which indicates behavior \u201csuch as abusing the employer\u2019s trust, stealing, revealing the employer\u2019s professional secrets.\u201d Ozak Tekstil didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s question on why it had chosen those codes, beyond insisting the firings had been justified. Nor did Levi\u2019s respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on this issue. Bakis has moved in with her parents and lives alongside more than 10 other people in a three-bedroom apartment, amounting to about 100 square meters (1,076 square feet) of space. Seasonal farm work may now be her only employment option. \u201cWe expected more from Levi\u2019s than from Ozak, because it\u2019s an international company and a brand that talks a lot about humane working conditions,\u201d she said, noting that some of her friends who had also been fired by the factory in December had \u201cchildren at home who were hungry.\u201d According to WRC researchers, who have been in touch with Levi\u2019s for months, the company has no plans to provide monetary assistance or compensation to any of the fired workers. Ozak Tekstil said the mass dismissals in December had \u201cnothing to do with working hours or wages.\u201d \u201cOzak Tekstil is one of the companies that employs personnel in the best working conditions and pays the highest wages in the textile industry in the (Sanliurfa) region,\u201d it added. Gulel and Bakis beg to differ. They are among 21 former employees who are suing Ozak Tekstil for back pay \u2014 including unpaid overtime, severance pay, holiday pay and for working on weekends and national holidays. They are also seeking further compensation because they claim they were fired due to their union ties, according to the lawyer for the group. Ozak Tekstil denies this. \u201cAfter all these rights violations, they took away our bread, they took away our jobs. They didn\u2019t leave anything undone to us, just because we were demanding our rights. But justice never prevailed. I hope it does from now on,\u201d Bakis said.

{"id": "2024_06_26_economy_wealthy-economy-inflation", "text": "About one in three Americans making six-figure salaries are worried about paying their bills, according to a new survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The survey finds a notable increase over the past year of consumers making $100,000 a year or more who are concerned about making ends meet over the next 12 months. A significant share of wealthier Americans are coping with financial pressure by cutting spending, including dialing back restaurant visits and entertainment. The findings underscore how years of high inflation and elevated borrowing costs continue to squeeze consumers\u2019 budgets \u2014 even f\ufeffor those at the higher end of the income spectrum. Nearly a third (30.8%) of consumers making between $100,000 and $149,999 a year are concerned about making ends meet in the next six months, according to the Philly Fed survey, which was fielded from March 22 to April 6. That\u2019s up from 21.3% of Americans in that income bracket concerned about making ends meet a year earlier. Similarly, 32.5% of those earning $150,000 or more indicated they are concerned about paying the bills, up from 21.7% a year earlier. Those more affluent Americans are more concerned than the 23% of those making $70,000 to $99,999, according to the survey. Among all consumers, about one in three (34.9%) said they are concerned about making ends meet, up from 28.7% a year earlier. Younger Americans are more likely to be feeling the financial pressure than older. Forty-one percent of those between 18 and 35 years old said they are concerned about making ends meet, compared with just 22% of those over 65. There was also a notable increase in higher-earning consumers nervous about paying bills in the longer run. For instance, 32.3% of those making $100,000 to $149,999 said they are concerned about making ends meet in the next seven to 12 months, up from 26.5% a year ago. There was an even bigger increase among those making at least $150,000, with 33% saying they are concerned, up from 19.8% a year ago. The Philly Fed survey found a \u201clarge and significant\u201d increase in the past year of people who are currently able to pay their bills but are concerned they won\u2019t be able to in the next six months. That increased from 20.7% a year ago to 26.2%. The mood wasn\u2019t all gloomy, however. A growing share of wealthier consumers expect higher incomes this year, including 40.8% of those making $150,000 a year or more, up from 20% a year ago. And consumers reported feeling more optimistic than they did a year ago. Perhaps that helps explain why Americans continue to spend aggressively on travel. The Transportation Security Administration screened a record 2.99 million people at airports on Sunday. The agency is bracing for a record-setting summer of air travel, peaking over the Fourth of July holiday. TSA expects to screen more than 32 million people from June 27 through July 8, 5.4% more than last year. Still, to manage financial stress, 43.1% of consumers indicate they are cutting discretionary spending for things like entertainment and dining out. More than a third (37.1%) of those making more than $150,000 a year say they are doing the same. Some consumers are even cutting spending on essentials like food or medical care, with 23.5% of all Americans saying they are doing that, compared with 17.1% of high-earners. Other steps include taking an additional job (15.3% of higher earners), borrowing more (10.2%) and taking money out of retirement savings early (14.3%).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/economy/wealthy-economy-inflation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_business_cdk-global-car-dealership-outage", "text": "CDK Global is ubiquitous in the auto dealership world \u2013 its software is used at 15,000 dealers. Its products handle everything from records to scheduling. Now, thousands of dealerships across the United States and Canada are entering a third day in a near deadlock after two consecutive cyber incidents at CDK Global led to a shut down of its systems. There\u2019s never an opportune time for a systems outage, but it\u2019s now the official start of summer, a time when many Americans are shopping for a new car and dealerships enjoy a bump in sales. Here\u2019s what the CDK Global outage means for both car sellers and shoppers. What exactly happened? On Wednesday, CDK spokesperson Lisa Finney told CNN that the company was investigating a cyber incident. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution and concern for our customers, we have shut down most of our systems and are working diligently to get everything up and running as quickly as possible,\u201d Finney said in the statement. Later Wednesday, the company said most of its critical computer systems were back online. But Thursday morning, the company told dealerships another incident had happened. North Carolina-based Sonic Automotive said it was a \u201ccybersecurity incident.\u201d CNN has asked CDK to confirm. Are systems still shut down? CDK said it proactively shut down most of its systems after it experienced an additional cyber incident late in the evening on Wednesday, June 19. \u201cIn partnership with third party experts, we are assessing the impact and providing regular updates to our customers. We remain vigilant in our efforts to reinstate our services and get our dealers back to business as usual as quickly as possible,\u201d the company said in a statement Thursday. On Thursday afternoon, the company said it still had no new information. The company told dealers the systems could be down for several days, according to two sources briefed on the situation. What does CDK Global do? CDK Global provides data and technology to different automotive dealerships. Its systems are used by roughly 15,000 car dealerships across the United States and Canada. CDK operates different products that car dealers use to handle things like keeping records of negotiated deals to scheduling and communicating about service. Not every dealer uses CDK\u2019s products, and even those that do may not use them for everything, but the system shutdown has been a problem for many. To protect customer privacy, customers\u2019 details aren\u2019t written out on a piece of paper that\u2019s just sitting on a desk anymore. Instead, information about deals and customer appointments is\u00a0kept in a server that\u2019s now impossible for salespeople affected by the outage to access. Why is this a bad time for dealerships? The outage can eat into sales during the first official weekend of the summer. Summer is car-buying season. CDK said it themselves in a blog post on its site last week. Post Memorial Day, \u201cthis presents increased opportunities for vehicle sales, service and, of course, revenue. It also means that it\u2019s time to roll out your summer Sales and Service marketing campaigns.\u201d In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Sonic Automotive said the outage resulted in disruptions to its dealer management system hosted by CDK, \u201cwhich supports critical dealership operations including those supporting sales, inventory and accounting functions and its customer relationship management system.\u201d The company said that while the outage has affected its business operations, it hasn\u2019t determined the financial impact. Can I still buy a car? Jeff Ramsey, an executive with Ourisman Auto Group, which is headquartered in Maryland, told CNN the shutdown is a major hassle and could cost his dealerships some business. Customers who are delayed in closing a sale at one of his dealerships could just find a dealer nearby that\u2019s not having these issues and buy a new vehicle there, instead. However, some affected dealerships are still selling cars. \u201cMy selling team can hand-write a buyer\u2019s order,\u201d said Brian Benstock, general manager of Paragon Honda and Paragon Acura in Long Island City, New York. But salespeople could lack access to customer agreements that had been previously negotiated, making it harder to close those sales, dealers CNN spoke with said. There\u2019s more than just the negotiated price of the car involved, since these agreements can involve rebates and incentives, some of which customers must show they\u2019re qualified for. What are automakers saying? Ramsey, whose company operates a number of dealerships, said automakers including Kia, Toyota and Stellantis, which makes Jeep and Dodge vehicles, have been very helpful with finding ways to serve customers even with all technology issues. Ford also said its dealerships involved in the CDK outage have alternate ways to take care of customers. \u201cAlthough there is an industry-wide system outage for some dealers who use CDK, Ford and Lincoln customers are able to receive sales and service support due to alternative processes available to our dealers. While a customer\u2019s local dealer remains the best place for information about their sales and service needs, they can always contact the Ford Customer Relationship Center at 1-800-392-3673,\u201d Ford said in a statement shared with CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/business/cdk-global-car-dealership-outage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_tech_apple-ai-chatgpt-ban-china", "text": "Apple is banking on its upcoming AI features to boost iPhone sales especially in China, where demand has been lagging. But there\u2019s a problem: ChatGPT \u2014 soon to be integrated into Siri \u2014 is banned in China. In a presentation earlier this month, Apple (AAPL) showed off its proprietary technology called Apple Intelligence to power compelling new AI features and announced a partnership with OpenAI to also use its viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity. (When Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry, ChatGPT can step in.) The move signaled how Apple is trying to expedite the latest buzzy technology at a time when tech rivals, such as Microsoft, Google, Meta and Samsung, have already found their AI footing. A deal with OpenAI could help Apple close the gap. But China is one of the first countries in the world to regulate the generative AI technology that powers these popular services. In August, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s top internet watchdog, rolled out new guidelines for the industry, requiring companies to seek approval before deployment. The organization has approved more than 100 AI models as of March, all from Chinese companies. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal Thursday, Apple is looking for a Chinese AI company to partner with ahead of the iPhone\u2019s expected September launch, but it hasn\u2019t reached a deal yet. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The need to find a partner \u2014 and quickly \u2014 comes at a time when Apple\u2019s smartphone sales tumbled a stunning 10% in the first quarter of this year, according to market research firm IDC, due largely to iPhone sales sharply dropping in China. The company has lost momentum in China as nationalism, a rough economy and increased competition have also hurt sales. China is the company\u2019s second-largest market. Trouble in the EU Limitations on its new AI tools may not be specific to China. In a statement sent to CNN following the publication of this article, Apple said it \u201chighly motivated\u201d to bring the features to customers around the world, but it is facing regulatory challenges in the European Union, as well. The company said it doesn\u2019t believe it will be able to roll out its AI features in Europe this year. \u201cDue to the regulatory uncertainties brought about by the Digital Markets Act (DMA), we do not believe that we will be able to roll out three of these features\u2014iPhone Mirroring, SharePlay Screen Sharing enhancements, and Apple Intelligence\u2014to our EU users this year,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cSpecifically, we are concerned that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security,\u201d it added. \u201cWe are committed to collaborating with the European Commission in an attempt to find a solution that would enable us to deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety.\u201d Resurgent competitors In China, concerns around iPhone sales continue to mount as Chinese smartphone brand Huawei\u2019s smartphone sales growth was 70% in the first quarter, according to Counterpoint Research. If a solution is not worked out by fall, Chinese consumers may feel short changed and choose to wait until they can get the full AI experience with Apple, she added. \u201cApple is very likely to seek a local partner in China in place of OpenAI, because simply put, it needs to,\u201d said Nabila Popal, a senior director at IDC Research. \u201cChinese consumers are expecting\u00a0their premium phones to have the latest AI functionality and may\u00a0hesitate to spend over $1000 for devices that don\u2019t have all the AI bells and whistles.\u201d \u201cThe real growth in China for Apple will come in the long term, as Apple Intelligence evolves offering more use cases, extends language support beyond English and when Siri can leverage other local AI models to provide the ChatGPT-like function,\u201d Popal said. In the meantime, some AI companies in China may be better suited to target its consumers anyway, such as by offering more local dialects than what\u2019s currently found in foreign AI models, Reece Hayden, an analyst at ABI Research, noted. Apple wouldn\u2019t be the first foreign company to work with the Cyberspace Administration of China for AI and smartphones. In January, Samsung teamed up with Chinese tech giant Baidu (BIDU) to use its AI model to help power its translation service. It works with another AI firm Meitu for photo editing tools. In other parts of the world, Samsung uses its own propriety AI technology, along with Google\u2019s (GOOGL) AI model Gemini, which is also banned in China. Samsung, however, accounts for less than 1% of the total market in China, according to Counterpoint Research. Although the clock is ticking for Apple to secure a partnership ahead of its fall software launch, Jeff Fieldhack, a research director at Counterpoint, believes it will be able to ink a deal in time. \u201cApple should be able to have a partnership aligned very quickly because it has such a strong global install base, and it would be a gem for these companies to work with them,\u201d he said, noting that they\u2019d soon be established as an an AI power player in the country.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/tech/apple-ai-chatgpt-ban-china/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}

The new flavors are available only in the UK and Ireland. The decision has annoyed fans of the show (and of the doughy treats), with social media awash in comments ranging from annoyed to flat-out angry. \u201cFriends\u201d\u00a0was produced by Warner Bros., which shares the same parent company as CNN. The kerfuffle underscores how these kinds of promotional items can bring extra attention and publicity to companies, especially as Krispy Kreme said in a recent earnings call that the doughnut maker is trying to keep its brand fresh for consumers. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly innovating, constantly bringing excitement to the brand, and we\u2019re fresh, fresh daily,\u201d said CEO Josh Charlesworth\u00a0on a first-quarter earnings call in May, according to a transcript made available by FactSet. Special doughnuts \u2014 like the \u201cFriends\u201d flavors now \u2014 helped drive consumers to stores, he said, such as Valentine\u2019s Day or eclipse-themed promotions.

On Krispy Kreme\u2019s own Instagram account, fans have even commented on posts unrelated to the \u201cFriends\u201d offer.

Lots of Friends fans here who would love to spend their money.\u201d Another Instagram user, Ashley Smith, commented under a different unrelated post, \u201cWhy the friends donuts only in the UK?! We\u2019d love to have them here as well!\u201d The doughnut selection includes \u201cFriends,\u201d a chocolate glazed doughnut topped with an image of the fountain in the show\u2019s opening credits. \u201cTrifle\u201d is a strawberry and custard filled doughnut that references a 1999 episode about a failed dessert. \u201cHow You Doin?\u201d echoes Monica Geller\u2019s (played by Courtney Cox) iconic front door.

However, it\u2019s clear that there is something different about Dex; she\u2019s an entirely virtual \u201cdigital human,\u201d designed by a startup in the UK. For her performances, Dex is displayed on a video screen or as a holographic projection, with her mixes created by humans. She is animated using Unreal Engine \u2014 a 3D modeling software widely used in video games \u2014 combined with motion-capture. Generative artificial intelligence allows her to remember information and respond to questions, using a voice also generated by AI. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the only digital humans in the performance space that you can have a conversation and interact with,\u201d says Denise Harris, CCO of startup Sum Vivas. \u201cYou can ask her anything. She is a genius about music.\u201d Last month, Dex performed at Digital Fashion Weeks in New York, Paris and Milan, and she has modeled outfits by Prada and Louis Vuitton at digital fashion events. For Liverpool-based Sum Vivas she\u2019s a \u201cshowpiece\u201d for more practical applications. The company is now developing digital humans that can \u201clisten\u201d to people\u2019s questions and converse in real time. \u201cShellie\u201d can provide product information as an avatar on company websites, while \u201cArif\u201d is set to direct passengers and answer questions as a multilingual concierge on screens at airports. According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human. US and New Zealand-based UneeQ has developed animated conversational \u201cdigital humans\u201d that can be used as virtual sales reps and customer service agents on company websites, and this month it debuted Sama 2.0, an animated cabin crew member that answers questions on Qatar Airways\u2019 website and app. Microsoft recently announced that users of its Azure software would be able to create lifelike avatars capable of turning text prompts into animated speech. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_23_tech_apple-ringtone-by-the-seaside-alarm", "text": "One morning at 6 am, Gyaltsen Moktan woke in a panic. It was 2019. He worked at an all-you-can-eat sushi buffet and was responsible for opening the restaurant each morning. So he set a wakeup call on his iPhone. Then Apple\u2019s \u201cBy the Seaside\u201d alarm sound went off. Moktan chose the jaunty, cheerful tune available as a ringtone and alarm on many of Apple\u2019s devices, thinking that the song\u2019s easygoing melody would make waking up a peaceful experience. That bet soured. \u201cThe alarm is mocking you in a way. It\u2019s kind of like a horror movie, where they do the nursery rhyme before doom,\u201d said Moktan, now an English teacher in Tokyo, Japan. \u201cBy the Seaside\u201d is perhaps Apple\u2019s most polarizing alarm and ringtone, evoking comparisons to nails on a chalkboard, the word \u201cmoist\u201d and screaming children on a plane. In the past, phones had only one sound: the shrill, continuous ring of a landline. With so many ringtones now available, though, the sounds say more about how people express themselves \u2014 and what can cause stress and anxiety. You probably think you don\u2019t know \u201cBy the Seaside,\u201d but you do. On YouTube, there are extended versions, rap versions, versions played on various instruments. \u201cSome people think it\u2019s a great ringtone. And other people say, Oh, my God, it\u2019s terrible,\u201d said Carlos Xavier Rodriguez, chair of music theory at the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance, of the divisive tune. \u201cYou love it or you hate it.\u201d From knocker-uppers to chirping birds People have been trying to use sound to wake up reliably for centuries, relying on everything from church bells to roosters. Some people used to employ the services of knocker-uppers, or workers paid to wake customers by tapping on the door or window with a stick, until the 1970s in some parts of Britain. The first known alarm clock in the United States was invented by clockmaker Levi Hutchins of Concord, New Hampshire in 1787, but his clock rang just once at 4 am. In 1874, French inventor Antoine Redier patented an adjustable mechanical alarm clock. Seth Thomas patented a mechanical wind-up one a couple years later, and the electric alarm clock was invented by the end of the 19th century. (Its inventors probably didn\u2019t expect the iPhone.) Alarm clocks have evolved further since then. Some high-tech ones these days are designed to emit light mimicking sunrise, waking users gently with a soft glow and relaxing sounds such as birds twittering or the lilt of a flute. What is wrong with this song? Boston Flake, a 15-year old Utah high school student, says that \u201cBy the Seaside\u201d is the only alarm that can wake him up every morning for school. Far from a morning person, he has tried creating alarms himself that are mash-ups of songs, blaring sirens, horns and booming bass lines, to no avail. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a love-hate relationship,\u201d said Flake. \u201cSometimes I\u2019ll hear it in my dreams, and I\u2019ll get a little jolt and start freaking out.\u201d Apple did not respond to requests for comment. There are musical elements to \u201cBy the Seaside\u201d that make it difficult to listen to, says Rodriguez. There\u2019s no discernible key. The song doesn\u2019t end on a downbeat, so there\u2019s no feeling of resolution when it briefly pauses before repeating. But a bigger factor of users\u2019 emotional responses is the \u201cuncanny valley\u201d element to the tune, says Rodriguez. The uncanny valley phenomenon is the uneasy feeling people have towards life-like, but not quite human things such as robots, dolls or even clowns. \u201cBy the Seaside\u201d has an electronic, cheesy sound of a Casio keyboard that is reminiscent of computerized music eerily devoid of human touch, Rodrigo said. The alarm sound\u2019s critics are vocal with their displeasure: \u201cif ur alarm is \u2018by the seaside\u2019 you are one unserious\u201d person, says one viral post on X, using a somewhat spicier word than \u201cperson.\u201d It has received 160,000 likes and more than 15,000 reposts, with many users weighing in with their own thoughts. Some claim that the tune sends them into a \u201cflight or fight\u201d response. Others say the tune gives them heart palpitations and that it fills them with dread. So controversial is the nautical jingle that it\u2019s even spawned internet lore. Rumors have circulated on social media that pop singer Adele wrote the tune and that it has made her more money than her entire discography combined. Ryan Meadows, the creator of Fake Showbiz News, confirmed to CNN that he started that rumor. \u201cWe like to think [Adele would] find the joke funny. Perhaps it might even inspire her to compose a suite [of] ringtones for the iPhones of the future!\u201d Meadows, who goes by a pseudonym, wrote in an email to CNN. Representatives for Adele did not respond to requests for comment. To be sure, the tune has its supporters. Krystal Roxas, a biopharmaceuticals quality systems specialist in San Bruno, California, used to wake up to the default \u201cRadar\u201d alarm. She switched to \u201cBy the Seaside\u201d in 2018 after moving in with her boyfriend, who complained that her then-alarm sound made him anxious in the morning. She has been a faithful listener since. \u201cI love \u2018By the Seaside.\u2019 I don\u2019t know why people hate on it,\u201d said Roxas, 34. \u201cI actually let it play out until it\u2019s done. I do a little dance in bed.\u201d Moktan, 26, concedes that he believes users\u2019 hate for the alarm might stem from the fact that people just end up hating whatever wakes them up. He once tried to set Bill Withers and Grover Washington, Jr\u2019s \u201cJust the Two of Us\u201d as his alarm, before changing it because he began disliking the song, he says. \u201cI have yet to find an alarm I like,\u201d Moktan said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/tech/apple-ringtone-by-the-seaside-alarm/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition.

The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world.

The conference, which is widely anticipated each year as a major showcase for Apple software news, will run Monday, June 10 through Friday, June 14. Although last year\u2019s WWDC focused on the unveiling of the Vision Pro mixed reality headset, which launched in stores in February, this year is expected to turn to Apple\u2019s AI efforts. The company is reportedly interested in licensing and building Google\u2019s Gemini AI engine, which includes chatbots and other AI tools, into upcoming iPhones and its iOS 18 features. As more tech companies pour billions of dollars into the development and rollout of artificial intelligence, Apple has largely been left out of the conversation, with many other tech companies making big strides in the space. A partnership with Google would catapult Apple into the growing AI arms race. Apple researchers also recently said they\u2019ve developed a family of multimodal models \u2014 which refers to an AI system that can interpret and generate different types of data, such as text and images at the same time \u2014 called MM1.

{"id": "2024_06_26_economy_fed-stress-test-results", "text": "America\u2019s biggest banks are well positioned to survive a severe recession while continuing to lend to households and businesses, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday in its annual bank resilience test, commonly referred to as a stress test. However, banks could suffer higher losses, if a significant economic downturn were to hit now versus a year ago. As a result of the banking crisis that fueled the Great Recession, the Fed conducts stress tests to monitor and uncover potential signs of weaknesses in the financial system. The tests have taken on an extra layer of importance after the collapse of three US banks sent shockwaves through the banking system last year. The 31 banks required to take the test would lose $685 billion. That\u2019s an increase of $144 billion compared to last year\u2019s stress test results. However, fewer banks were tested last year. Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr attributed the higher collective losses to the fact that banks have taken on more risk while incurring higher expenses. The higher interest rate environment we\u2019re currently in has made it riskier, and more costly, for banks to make loans, which can depress their profitability. One area that weighed on banks more compared to last year is credit card debt, which recently hit a record high. Additionally, a higher percentage of people are making late payments. Both resulted in higher projected credit card losses. At the same time, banks\u2019 income from fees was lower, giving them less of a buffer to absorb those losses. \u201cThe goal of our test is to help to ensure that banks have enough capital to absorb losses in a highly stressful scenario. This test shows that they do,\u201d Barr said. While all banks passed the tests, their performance varied significantly under the severe recession scenario. Discover Financial Services suffered the biggest loan loss rate of 18.7%, followed by Capital One\u2019s 16.5% loan loss rate. Earlier this year, Capital One (COF) announced plans to acquire Discover (DFS). The acquisition hasn\u2019t been finalized and is subject to approval by the Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which are set to hold a joint meeting about the proposed acquisition next month. Discover\u2019s and Capital One\u2019s performance in the stress tests will likely cause regulators to scrutinize their financials even more closely, at a minimum. Shares of both companies fell in after-hours trading following the release of stress test results at 4:30 pm ET on Wednesday. In contrast, Charles Schwab (SCHW) suffered the smallest loan loss rate of 1.3%. Its stock moved slightly higher after the stress test results.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/economy/fed-stress-test-results/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}

Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}

The data provider\u2019s software, which dealerships use to manage everything from scheduling to records, said Saturday it has begun restoring its software. \u201cWe anticipate that the process will take several days to complete, and in the interim we are continuing to actively engage with our customers and provide them with alternative\u00a0ways to conduct business,\u201d a CDK spokesperson told CNN on Saturday. CDK has said it is working to investigate the shutdown after two cyber incidents brought its systems to a standstill. The company has not confirmed who was behind the incidents. Bloomberg previously reported the company was negotiating with an Eastern European-based hacker group demanding tens of millions of dollars in ransom to end the outage. CDK has not responded Sunday to CNN\u2019s request for comment about the reported ransom. Dealers implement temporary solutions Many car manufacturers and dealerships have scrambled to implement temporary solutions to maintain retail operations while their computer software remains offline. In an automated message via its toll-free number Saturday, CDK advised dealership employees to be cautious of phishing scams and take precautions to secure sensitive information such as passwords. Mike Stanton, the president and CEO of the National Automobile Dealers Association, told CNN in a statement the group \u201ccontinues seeking information from CDK on the nature and scope of the cyber incident, so dealers are able to respond appropriately.\u201d \u201cThousands of franchised new-car dealerships rely on CDK to run their businesses and this outage has impacted dealers\u2019 ability to provide a seamless customer experience and process transactions efficiently,\u201d he added. The system shutdown could slow down business and cause shipping delays at dealerships as the summer season gears up. Dealership sales in 2023 topped $1.2 trillion in the United States, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. Car manufacturer Ford told CNN it is working with dealers to set up alternative software systems and other workarounds. A company spokesperson emphasized the effects of the outage will vary from dealer to dealer. Ford said it encourages customers to contact their local dealership for information. Several dealerships on the East Coast told CNN on Sunday they are manually filling out forms to process sales. Some businesses mentioned they are having issues with registering purchased cars with the state, as they rely on CDK\u2019s software to send registration information to their respective motor vehicle department. One used car dealership told CNN it has been filing paperwork by hand and sending runners to the car registry with the paperwork. Another dealer said they\u2019re still selling cars but can\u2019t complete transactions in a timely manner. In a Friday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Penske Automotive said while its auto dealers don\u2019t use CDK Global, its Premier Trucking Group division \u2014 which mainly serve businesses \u2014 does use CDK\u2019s dealer management system. Penske said it was working on implementing response plans and its 48 PTG locations remain operational. In another SEC filing, Sonic Automotive said it was also operational but was instating \u201cworkaround solutions to minimize the disruption\u00a0caused by this CDK outage.\u201d The company added the incident will likely negatively impact Sonic\u2019s financial and business operations. Premier Truck Group declined to elaborate on its response plans.

{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_media_cnn-presidential-debate", "text": "CNN on Thursday\u00a0will do something no network has done in more than 35 years \u2013 host its own general election presidential debate. It is a pivotal moment, not just for the country as it picks a new president, but also for CNN \u2014 with a new leader at the helm of\u00a0the news network that has been beset\u00a0by declining\u00a0television viewership\u00a0as it urgently embarks on a\u00a0major\u00a0newsroom\u00a0overhaul to embrace its digital future. Thursday night\u2019s presidential debate, a marketing coup for CNN and its new chief executive, Mark Thompson,\u00a0will\u00a0offer the network a\u00a0bright spot \u2013 and expectations of\u00a0record\u00a0ratings, even if viewers end up watching the debate on other networks. No matter where viewers\u00a0tune in to watch the primetime matchup between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, it will be clear this is a CNN debate. As a\u00a0public service, CNN has allowed\u00a0other\u00a0networks to air the event,\u00a0so long as they agree to\u00a0the network\u2019s rules\u00a0over\u00a0how the\u00a0event\u00a0is promoted and\u00a0re-broadcast. Rival networks, for example,\u00a0have agreed to\u00a0use CNN in the programming title and keep the\u00a0red CNN logo on screen\u00a0throughout\u00a0the debate. For CNN, the branding boost from the debate may provide a much-needed shot in the arm. Over the last year, CNN\u2019s television viewership has fallen, regularly settling into third place behind MSNBC and the right-wing talk channel Fox News. Last week, CNN total viewership averaged fewer than 500,000 in primetime, and 80,000 in the advertiser-coveted 25-to-54-year-old demographic, according to Nielsen. The declining viewership trend is not unique to CNN. But it has notably taken hold during breaking news events, once seen as the network\u2019s bread and butter, when general audiences turned to the cable channel en masse to watch unfolding coverage. CNN is also looking to move past previous missteps. Last year, under then-network chief Chris Licht, the network hosted a live town hall with Trump, in which the former president unloaded a host of lies and insulted moderator Kaitlan Collins as an audience applauded and cheered. Licht was later fired after a brief but tumultuous tenure. Thursday\u2019s debate offers Thompson and the network\u2019s executives the chance to reset the reputation of a network that has long defined itself as \u201cthe most trusted name in news.\u201d Thursday\u2019s debate will pose a high-stakes test for Thompson and the network\u2019s executives as they go it alone without the independent Commission on Presidential Debates, making key decisions about how the politically charged showdown will appear for the millions expected to tune in. A break in tradition CNN\u2019s debate will include some shifts in tradition,\u00a0including\u00a0two\u00a0commercial breaks during the roughly\u00a090-minute\u00a0event, a first since the Commission on Presidential Debates took over the process more than 35 years ago. Other networks are also free to sell their own advertising but cannot put up their own commentators or anchors during\u00a0the\u00a0breaks. There will be no live audience this time, and the candidates\u2019 microphones will be muted while the other is speaking.\u00a0The podiums will also be eight feet apart, much closer than the last Trump-Biden debate in 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic, when they were positioned 12 feet apart. It\u2019s also the earliest a\u00a0general election\u00a0debate has ever been held,\u00a0coming\u00a0weeks\u00a0before either candidate\u00a0is formally nominated at their party\u2019s conventions. \u201cThat\u2019s by design,\u201d CNN political director David Chalian said. \u201cThe Biden campaign was certainly interested in an earlier debate, in part because I think they see a target universe of voters that they\u2019re trying to reach who aren\u2019t engaged in this election.\u201d Frank Fahrenkopf, co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates, said he was \u201cshocked\u201d\u00a0by how early the debate was taking place in the campaign.\u00a0The commission, which has sponsored the debates since the 1980s,\u00a0\u201cregrettably announced\u201d\u00a0Monday that it was\u00a0cancelling its debates\u00a0for the 2024 election that had been scheduled for September and October. \u201cThe Biden-Harris Campaign informed the Commission that President Biden will not agree to debate under the sponsorship of the Commission during the 2024 general election campaign,\u201d it said. Instead, both candidates have agreed to a second debate in September hosted by ABC. This isn\u2019t\u00a0the first time the commission\u2019s role\u00a0in the debates has been\u00a0challenged. In 2000, then\u00a0Gov.\u00a0George W. Bush challenged then Vice President Al Gore to three debates \u2013 one by the commission, and two other ones to be hosted by CNN and NBC. But in the end, Bush relented, and the candidates debated each other three times in the span of eight days in commission-sponsored debates. Alan Schroeder, a\u00a0journalism\u00a0professor at Northeastern University and author of the book \u201cPresidential Debates: Risky Business on the Campaign Trail,\u201d said he\u2019s an \u201caficionado\u201d of the debate commission because of that history. \u201cPresidential debates have a long history of being tampered with by the campaigns, and the commission over its many decades did an excellent job circumventing the political shenanigans and institutionalizing presidential debates as an expectation rather than something that might or might not take place depending on the candidates\u2019 whims and poll standings,\u201d Schroeder said. A new format \u2013 and few fact checks While both Biden and Trump have agreed to the terms of\u00a0CNN\u2019s\u00a0debate, including the format, rules and moderators, the Trump campaign has spent the days leading up to Thursday\u00a0assailing\u00a0the moderators, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, and questioning their objectivity. The move, a page out of the Trump media playbook, is a repeat of the 2020 campaign, when Trump also attacked\u00a0the moderators of the general election debates. \u201cTrump may complain about CNN, but he was quick to accept their sponsorship, so I believe that speaks for itself,\u201d Schroeder said. \u201cTo me it just sounds like whining,\u201d he added. \u201cFor sure, there is an element of trying to \u2018work the refs\u2019 in advance of the event, but I think most people are smart enough to see that for what it is.\u201d One thing that will not be a major feature of this debate:\u00a0fact checking. \u201cWhat we want to make sure that we do here, our role here, is to facilitate, to moderate a debate between these two candidates,\u201d Chalian said. \u201cNot for Jake and Dana to become participants in that debate, but to make sure that President Biden and former President Trump have the ability, have the time and space to get their visions out to the American people on these issues that are top of mind for them.\u201d That means it will be mostly up to the candidates to try\u00a0to\u00a0correct the record on stage should their rival push lies or misinformation, a particularly thorny challenge given Trump\u2019s lengthy history of using major platforms to unleash falsehoods. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult, if not impossible, for moderators to fact-check during a live debate,\u201d Schroeder said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a clear-cut issue that can be dispensed within five seconds \u2013 like a candidate claiming the sky is not blue \u2013 then that\u2019s easy enough to handle, but most issues are a lot more complex than that and cannot be resolved in real time on an immediate basis.\u201d CNN, for its part, plans to offer a fact-check of the candidates\u2019\u00a0claims following the telecast. While CNN and ABC are hosting the debates this election season, Fahrenkopf said he believes the 2024 debates are merely a hiccup in the commission\u2019s long history, and that they\u2019ll be back to sponsoring the debates for the next campaign. \u201cThere are other ways to do things and we\u2019ll look at it, and maybe (the CPD) will learn something from it,\u201d he said. But with the candidates moving to\u00a0circumvent the commission and its rules, some critics have\u00a0suggested it could eventually result in\u00a0highly partisan actors hosting the debates\u00a0in the future.\u00a0But Schroeder said he doesn\u2019t\u00a0believe\u00a0that Thursday\u2019s event will lead to that possibility, since each campaign still must sign off on the\u00a0terms of any\u00a0debate. For now, he said,\u00a0there are still \u201cenough mainstream news organizations.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/media/cnn-presidential-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}

NBC announced on Wednesday it will use AI software to recreate Michaels\u2019 voice to deliver daily recaps of the Summer Games for subscribers of its Peacock streaming platform, a milestone for the use of AI by a major media company. The use of an AI voice for the Olympics comes as the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, sound and text.

A new tool, called \u201cYour Daily Olympic Recap on Peacock,\u201d will enable 10-minute highlights packages, which can include events updates, athlete back stories and other related content personalized by subscriber preferences. The company said the highlights could be packaged in about 7 million different ways, pulled from 5,000 hours of live coverage in Paris, effectively making AI (the artificial intelligence, not the man) a significantly more efficient way to deliver personalized recaps.  \u201cWhen I was approached about this, I was skeptical but obviously curious,\u201d Michaels said in a press release. \u201cThen I saw a demonstration detailing what they had in mind.

{"id": "2024_06_25_tech_nvidia-stock-fall-worlds-third-biggest-company", "text": "Nvidia stock staged a comeback on Tuesday after a multi-day sell-off that cost the US chipmaker its crown as the world\u2019s most valuable public company. On Tuesday, Nvidia closed nearly 7% higher, reversing course after three straight days of declines, which caused some investors to worry that the excitement over the crucial role the company is expected to play in the artificial intelligence revolution may be cooling. \u201cWhile we do believe in AI, there have been signs of over-exuberance in the US market over the last month,\u201d Jim Reid, a research strategist at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note Monday. On June 18, the chipmaking giant\u2019s market capitalization hit $3.34 trillion, surpassing Microsoft\u2019s to become the world\u2019s most valuable company. Over the next three trading days, though, the company shed $430 billion. Despite the rally in Nvidia\u2019s shares on Tuesday, Nvidia\u2019s market cap now stands at $3.10 trillion, falling to third place, behind Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), which have market caps of $3.35 trillion and $3.21 trillion, respectively. \u201cWhat we see with Nvidia is typical volatility, which is expected when a stock rises as quickly as Nvidia\u2019s did,\u201d Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at trading platform CMC Markets, told CNN. Nvidia\u2019s stock has been on a tear, soaring more than 161% since January. The company\u2019s chips power AI systems, including generative AI, the technology behind OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT that can create text, images and other media. Market contagion? Frenzy around the potential for AI to radically change the way we live and work \u2014\u00a0and make big returns for investors \u2014 has driven much of the stock market\u2019s returns over the past year and a half. Nvidia is a member of the so-called Magnificent Seven, the mega-cap tech companies whose shares greatly outperformed the broader US stock market rally last year. The S&P 500 index climbed 24.2% over 2023, compared with the more than 100% average rise in the stocks of the Magnificent Seven. In a note published Monday, Deutsche Bank noted that, as a result of the seven stocks\u2019 dominance, \u201cthe US stock market is close to being the most concentrated in history.\u201d On Tuesday, the bank wrote that the decline in Nvidia\u2019s stock the previous day had \u201cheld down US equity returns more broadly.\u201d On Tuesday, Nvidia\u2019s rally helped lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which rose 1.3%.

{"id": "2024_06_26_business_nobel-economists-trump-inflation", "text": "Inflation remains public enemy No. 1 in today\u2019s economy. Americans are fed up with the cost of living and former President Donald Trump says he will help. Yet 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists are warning that Trump\u2019s proposals wouldn\u2019t just fail to fix inflation \u2014 they would make matters worse. \u201cWe the undersigned are deeply concerned about the risks of a second Trump administration for the US economy,\u201d the economists wrote in the Tuesday letter, which was first reported by\u00a0Axios. The letter, organized by famed economist Joseph Stiglitz, argued there are valid reasons to worry the Trump agenda will \u201creignite\u201d inflation. In particular, the economists point to Trump\u2019s \u201cfiscally irresponsible budgets\u201d and nonpartisan research from the likes of the Peterson Institute, Oxford Economics and Allianz that finds the Trump agenda \u2014 if successfully enacted \u2014 would increase inflation. Trump approved $8.4 trillion\u00a0of new 10-year borrowing during his term  \u2014 nearly twice as much as President Joe Biden has so far in office, according to\u00a0fiscal watchdog group the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Not only does Trump want to extend his 2017 tax cuts \u2014 a move that the Congressional Budget Office warns would cost nearly $5 trillion \u2014 but the former president recently\u00a0told CEOs during a closed-door meeting\u00a0that he\u2019d like to cut the corporate tax rate even further. However, cutting taxes would risk accelerating an economy at a time when the Federal Reserve is working hard to slow it down to fight inflation. \u201cThe outcome of this election will have economic repercussions for years, and possibly decades, to come,\u201d the economists wrote in the letter. \u201cWe believe that a second Trump term would have a negative impact on the US\u2019s economic standing in the world and a destabilizing effect on the US\u2019s domestic economy.\u201d The Stiglitz-led letter did not directly mention Trump\u2019s trade and immigration policies, but some mainstream economists warn they would be inflationary, too. Trump has called for raising tariffs on China and all other trading partners \u2014 a move that\u00a0Moody\u2019s Analytics predicted\u00a0would kill jobs and worsen inflation. Trump argues the tariffs would save jobs and punish China for trade practices that both parties are fed up with. Biden has kept in place the vast majority of the Trump-era tariffs and recently lifted some tariffs on China, albeit in a more targeted way. Some economists are also concerned Trump\u2019s plans to launch an immigration crackdown and unprecedented deportations\u00a0will overheat the jobs market\u00a0and boost consumer prices. In the letter, the 16 Nobel economists expressed concern about the rule of law and stability if Trump wins the White House again. \u201cAmong the most important determinants of economics success are the rule of law and economic and policy certainty,\u201d the letter said. \u201cDonald Trump and the vagaries of his action and policies threaten this stability and the US\u2019s standing in the world.\u201d Beyond Stiglitz, the letter was signed by Robert Shiller, who famously called the mid-2000s housing bubble, former World Bank chief economist Paul Romer, and George Akerlof, the husband of US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. By contrast, the economists praised Biden\u2019s work on the economy, arguing his major investments in infrastructure, manufacturing and climate will lower long-term inflationary pressure and ease the clean energy transition. \u201cWhile each of us has different views on the particulars of various economic policies,\u201d the economists wrote in the letter, \u201cwe all agree that Joe Biden\u2019s economic agenda is vastly superior to Donald Trump\u2019s.\u201d In response, the Trump campaign blasted the economists and blamed Biden for high inflation. \u201cThe American people don\u2019t need worthless out of touch Nobel prize winners to tell them which president put more money in their pockets,\u201d Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign\u2019s national press secretary, said in a statement to CNN. \u201cAmericans know we cannot afford four more years of Bidenomics, and when President Trump is back in the White House, he will reimplement his pro-growth, pro-energy, pro-jobs agenda to bring down the cost of living and uplift all Americans.\u201d To be sure, economists don\u2019t have a crystal ball, not even Nobel Prize winners. And\u00a0voters do give Trump higher marks on the economy. As CNN\u2019s Harry Enten has reported, an average of polls gives Trump an 18-point lead over Biden on inflation and 13 points on the economy. In an ABC News/Ipsos poll in May,\u00a0more than 80% of respondents\u00a0said the economy and inflation were important in determining their vote \u2014 and on both issues Trump scored a 14-point lead over Biden. Voters have made clear their concerns about Biden on the economy. Just 34% of Americans approved of Biden\u2019s economic policies in a\u00a0late April CNN poll\u00a0and even fewer (29%) approve of Biden on inflation. And yet some experts are concerned about what Trump\u2019s policies would mean for the economy. Last week, Moody\u2019s Analytics cautioned that if Republicans sweep into power in November, a toxic mix of higher tariffs, fewer immigrants and tax cut-fueled stimulus would cause inflation to reaccelerate, unemployment to climb above 5% and the US economy to stumble into a recession. By contrast, Moody\u2019s found that if Biden wins and there is a divided Congress, the Fed will start cutting interest rates, inflation will go back to normal and the US economy will avoid a recession.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/business/nobel-economists-trump-inflation/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_business_denmark-cows-carbon-tax", "text": "Dairy farmers in Denmark face having to pay an annual tax of 672 krone ($96) per cow for the planet-heating emissions they generate. The country\u2019s coalition government agreed this week to introduce the world\u2019s first carbon emissions tax on agriculture. It will mean new levies on livestock starting in 2030. Denmark is a major dairy and pork exporter, and agriculture is the country\u2019s biggest source of emissions. The coalition agreement \u2014 which also entails investing 40 billion krone ($3.7 billion) in measures such as reforestation and establishing wetlands \u2014 is aimed at helping the country meet its climate goals. \u201cWith today\u2019s agreement, we are investing billions in the biggest transformation of the Danish landscape in recent times,\u201d Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cAt the same time, we will be the first country in the world with a (carbon) tax on agriculture.\u201d The Danish dairy industry broadly welcomed the agreement and its goals, but it has angered some farmers. The move comes just months after farmers held protests across Europe, blocking roads with tractors and pelting the European Parliament with eggs over a long list of complaints, including gripes about environmental regulation and excessive red tape. The global food system is a huge contributor to the climate crisis, producing around a third of greenhouse gas emissions. Livestock farming has a particularly big impact, accounting for around 12% of global emissions in 2015, according to the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization. A share of this pollution comes from methane, a potent planet-warming gas produced by cows and some other animals through their burps and manure. Reducing livestock emissions The tax, expected to be approved by Denmark\u2019s parliament later this year, will amount to 300 krone ($43) per tonne (1.1 ton) of CO2-equivalent emissions from livestock from 2030, rising to 750 krone ($107) in 2035. A 60% tax break will apply, meaning that farmers will effectively be charged 120 krone ($17) per tonne of livestock emissions per year from 2030, rising to 300 krone ($43) in 2035. On average, Danish dairy cows, which account for much of the cattle population, emit 5.6 tonnes of CO2-equivalent per year, according to Concito, a green think tank in Denmark. Using the lower tax rate of 120 krone results in a charge of 672 krone per cow, or $96. With the tax break in place, that levy will rise to 1,680 krone per cow in 2035 ($241). In the first two years, the proceeds from the tax will be used to support the agricultural industry\u2019s green transition and then reassessed. \u201cThe whole purpose of the tax is to get the sector to look for solutions to reduce emissions,\u201d Concito\u2019s chief economist Torsten Hasforth told CNN. For example, farmers could change the feed they use. But Danish farmers\u2019 group B\u00e6redygtigt Landbrug said the measures amounted to a \u201cscary experiment.\u201d \u201cWe believe that the agreement is pure bureaucracy,\u201d chairman Peter Ki\u00e6r said in a statement. \u201cWe recognize that there is a climate problem\u2026 But we do not believe that this agreement will solve the problems, because it will put a spoke in the wheel of agriculture\u2019s green investments.\u201d Peder Tuborgh, the CEO of Arla Foods, Europe\u2019s largest dairy group, said the agreement was \u201cpositive\u201d but that farmers who \u201cgenuinely do everything they can to reduce emissions\u201d should not be subjected to a tax. \u201cIt is essential that the tax base for a (carbon) tax is solely based on emissions for which there are means to eliminate (them),\u201d he added in statement. Kristian Hundeboll, the CEO of DLG Group, one of Europe\u2019s biggest agricultural businesses and a cooperative owned by 25,000 Danish farmers, said it was \u201ccrucial for competitiveness\u201d for the tax to be \u201canchored\u201d in European Union legislation. \u201cNeither the climate, agriculture nor the ancillary industries benefit from Denmark acting unilaterally,\u201d he said.

That\u2019s partly because of the sustaining popularity of Connections, which was the second-biggest referrer to Strands behind people searching for it, and still has millions of players. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the new games build on each other, so that\u2019s really exciting as our audience has grown pretty significantly over the past couple of few years,\u201d he told CNN. What is Strands? Strands, like Connections, was recently hatched at a \u201cGame Jam\u201d\u00a0(think: a hackathon, but for games) and filled the need for a word search-type of game in the app. It \u201cbubbled up as a version of a word search that was true to the New York Times\u2019 games,\u201d Knight said. The Times\u2019 research of its subscribers found that Wordle players also solve word search games, making Strands a natural addition to its lineup. Notably, Strands also shares the same editor of Wordle \u2014 Tracy Bennett \u2014 who, along with her team of editors and testers, craft the daily puzzles. Strands is organized by a 6-by-8 grid of seemingly random letters with a category hint on the top. Players have to find several words relating to the theme. However, the Times\u2019 twist is that they also have to find the \u201cspanagram,\u201d which describes what all the words have in common. Knight suggests players to start at the corners of the puzzle and look for obvious words there. \u201cIf you get a toehold in the corner, you begin the process of filling out the whole board and it flows from there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a rush of accomplishment at the end.\u201d The solve rate is \u201cfairly high\u201d at 81% for Strands because of the hints that players get if they guess three words with at least four letters that aren\u2019t part of the theme. That\u2019s another part of the game, Knight said, because it challenges some people not to use the hints. \u201cIt should be really solvable for most people on most days,\u201d he said, especially compared to Connections, which is \u201cdeliberately a lot trickier.\u201d The easiness of Strands is part of the Games\u2019 strategy to have an \u201coverall range of puzzles for people to choose from that can be easier on one end and trickier on the other end,\u201d Knight added. He noted that Wordle still remains its most popular game and was played 4.8 billion times last year. Growth of games Games and Times\u2019 other apps like Cooking have been an essential part of the Times\u2019 strategy to boost revenue beyond advertising. Revenue from digital subscriptions crossed $1 billion for the first time in 2023. The Times currently has 10.6 million digital-only subscribers and its games have been played more than 8 billion times last year, according to its annual report. Games has helped the Times grow because news is a \u201ccrowded category and the market for subscriptions is limited, largely by ideology, and advertising against news is a declining market,\u201d Brian Morrissey, author of the Rebooting, a media newsletter, previously told CNN. The Times\u2019 success has prompted other companies, such as LinkedIn and Hearst, to take notice and start creating their own games. \u201cGames have proven a powerful way to acquire new customers that might be open to a bundle with news but who otherwise wouldn\u2019t subscribe to just news,\u201d Morrissey added. Times\u2019 Games app lets people play some puzzles, like Wordle and Strands, for free. Full access, which includes the Crossword, a few other games and archives, costs $6 per month. The recently redesigned app has been downloaded 21 million times globally since 2019, according to Sensor Tower data, with the number of downloads soaring 113% last year. Growth continued in 2024, with the number of downloads growing 165% in the first quarter of the year compared to the same time period a year prior, the market intelligence firm told CNN. But with that success does come with some stress for Knight and his team to find the next, Wordle, Connections or even Strands. \u201cThe bar is high now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a number of high-quality games in the app. As we go forward, we\u2019re certainly not done and we think there\u2019s room for more games, but we\u2019re being even more thoughtful than ever.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/media/nyt-strands-game-launch/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_business_boeing-whistleblower-787", "text": "A whistleblower has come forward Wednesday alleging parts of Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner planes were built in an unsafe manner \u2013 potentially leading to \u201cdevastating consequences.\u201d Richard Cuevas, a mechanic at Strom, a contractor for Boeing manufacturing partner Spirit Aerosystems, claims that he witnessed holes that were improperly drilled into the forward pressure bulkheads of 787 planes at Spirit\u2019s Wichita, Kansas, facility in 2023. The bulkhead is one of the primary parts of an airplane\u2019s body and crucial for keeping the structure of the plane intact while it\u2019s in the air. Cuevas claims that he filed a complaint in October 2023 to Boeing and Spirit about \u201csubstandard manufacturing and maintenance processes\u201d he witnessed, and was fired just a few months later, according to the complaints filed by his attorneys and obtained by CNN. Boeing said it had previously investigated Cuevas\u2019 allegations and they did not pose a safety problem. \u201cA subcontractor\u2019s employee previously reported concerns to us that we thoroughly investigated as we take seriously any safety-related matter,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cEngineering analysis determined that the issues raised did\u00a0not\u00a0present a safety concern and were addressed.\u201d The company said it is reviewing the documents Cuevas\u2019 attorneys made public Wednesday and will investigate any new claims. Spirit Aerosystems and Strom did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that they \u201cstrongly encourage anyone with safety concerns to report them and we thoroughly investigate every report.\u201d The FAA said it has revieved 126 Boeing whistleblower reports this year and 11 last year. Cuevas said the gaps he observed in the plane\u2019s forward pressure bulkheads appeared in two aircraft that he helped build and could potentially lead to \u201ccatastrophe.\u201d Cuevas claims the workers were drilling holes slightly larger than Boeing\u2019s specifications to \u201cclear excess paint from the holes and speed up a slow process,\u201d which, he believes, could compromise power and air pressure on the planes, creating serious safety risk for the passengers on board. Cuevas said he filed a complaint with Boeing\u2019s ethics hotline, reporting to management that he believed Spirit was hiding the issues from Boeing. He also alleges that Boeing opened an investigation into Cuevas\u2019 concerns in October 2023, alerting Spirit management to the complaints. During that time, Cuevas says his colleague remarked, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a snitch among us,\u201d and in March, Spirit suddenly fired Cuevas, according to the complaints. The complaints say Cuevas witnessed these problems with three planes he worked on and believes these issues may affect at least 10 to 12 planes either in production or already released to Boeing. A growing list of problems for Boeing The claims aren\u2019t new: A previous whistleblower, Sam Salehpour, a Boeing engineer, said he found and reported similar gaps in 787 and 777 aircraft. For nearly two years starting in 2021, the FAA and Boeing\u00a0halted deliveries of the new Dreamliners\u00a0while it looked into the gaps.\u00a0Boeing said it made changes in its manufacturing process, and deliveries ultimately resumed. More than a dozen whistleblowers have come forward against Boeing in recent years, and the number has grown substantially since a door plug blew off a 737 Max plane in January just after takeoff, leaving a gaping hole in the side the plane. Last week, for example, a current Boeing employee claimed that the company tried to shield broken or out-of-specification 737 Max plane parts from regulators and lost track of them \u2013 and he feared they may have been installed on planes that are carrying passengers. The FAA has opened multiple investigations into Boeing and the US Department of Justice said it may file criminal charges against the company because of its ongoing quality and safety failures. The FAA has said a six-week audit of Boeing\u2019s facilities conducted in the late winter found multiple problems with Boeing\u2019s production practices. A separate\u00a0report\u00a0found \u201cgaps\u201d in Boeing\u2019s safety culture, including a disconnect between management and employees, and fears among employees about retaliation for reporting safety concerns. Boeing\u2019s CEO Dave Calhoun last week apologized for Boeing\u2019s recent safety failures in testimony delivered to a Senate committee but pushed back on claims that the company retaliated against those who brought safety issues to light. Calhoun said Boeing is \u201cfar from perfect,\u201d and he acknowledged that the company will not easily regain the public\u2019s trust.

{"id": "2024_06_26_media_wall-street-journal-evan-gershkovich", "text": "Early Wednesday morning, at 2am ET, imprisoned\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich\u2019s\u00a0trial commenced before a Russian court on bogus espionage charges. Covering the judicial charade will present an unprecedented challenge for The Journal and other news outlets, given that the trial will take place in secret, behind closed doors. Some images of Gershkovich are expected to be distributed, but the flow of information will be tightly controlled by the\u00a0Vladimir Putin-led government, which will certainly work to splice together a narrative that supports its propaganda goals. Regardless of what information is made available by the court, there is one aspect of coverage that The Journal will be unmistakably clear about: Gershkovich is innocent, and the court proceedings amount to nothing but political theater. \u201cTo even call it a trial \u2026 is unfair to Evan and a continuation of this travesty of justice that already has gone on for far too long,\u201d\u00a0Emma Tucker, The Journal editor in chief,\u00a0bluntly stated Tuesday\u00a0in a letter to readers. Elena Cherney, who oversees the broadsheet\u2019s standards and ethics teams, stressed to me that it is imperative for The Journal \u2014\u00a0and other news organizations\u00a0\u2014 to make it abundantly clear that Gershkovich has been unjustly detained and that the proceedings are a \u201cviolation of human rights.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t a trial as we normally think of trials,\u201d Cherney said by phone Tuesday. \u201cThis is a process that is completely lacking in due process. It is obviously a bogus allegation. And we need to make it clear in our coverage that we are not leaning into the process\u2026 because we know these are empty charges and these are political charges.\u201d Indeed, The Journal has been clear-eyed about the matter since Gershkovich was detained by Russian authorities 15 months ago while gathering reporting in the city of Yekaterinburg. When Gershkovich was indicted earlier this month, the outlet ran a\u00a0strong headline\u00a0that refused to entertain the notion that Gershkovich was working as a clandestine spy for the U.S. government. \u201cWSJ Reporter Evan Gershkovich, Falsely Accused of Espionage, Is Indicted in Russia,\u201d the headline read. Other news outlets, however, have at times been less direct about the matter. Cherney, who told me that she has been in touch with various newsrooms ahead of the trial to offer The Journal\u2019s point of view, said she believes news organizations should be clear with audiences about the circumstances. Buying into the judicial show put on by Russia, after all, is what Russia desires \u2014 and it would deliver the Kremlin a propaganda victory. \u201cThis coverage should not read or sound as if this is a legitimate process,\u201d Cherney said, imploring other newsrooms not to legitimize the proceedings or get trapped in bothsidesism while covering the story. And while the court hearings will be held behind closed doors, Cherney said she believes that news organizations should lean into that aspect of the case when covering it, calling it a \u201ccritical piece of the story.\u201d \u201cIt is a secret trial, if you can call it a trial, and that is symptomatic of a complete lack of due process,\u201d Cherney said. \u201cThis is not how people are charged with crimes in the United States or other Western countries. And we need to take pains to explain everything we know about the lack of legal protection that Evan has \u2014 the lack of information that we have about the process.\u201d No verdict is expected to be rendered on Wednesday. And it\u2019s unclear precisely how long it will take for a final decision to be made. It could take weeks or even months for a verdict to be handed down by the Russian court. But Cherney and her colleagues at The Journal are hoping that the U.S. government will succeed in freeing Gershkovich. In the meantime, she said, they\u2019re all living through a nightmare. \u201cIt is the most difficult, terrible situation that we have ever dealt with and ever hope to deal with,\u201d Cherney said, \u201cand we just hope to get him out.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/media/wall-street-journal-evan-gershkovich/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope", "text": "A federal judge\u2019s decision this week reprimanding Elon Musk\u2019s X will have reverberating effects on efforts to hold influential online platforms accountable, legal experts and advocacy groups say. On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}

Or if you are aware of it, you might think, \u201cWell that sucks, but good thing I won\u2019t be hurt by it.\u201d Not so fast. What\u2019s happening: CDK Global, a data provider whose software is used by car dealerships to handle everything from records to scheduling, was hit by cyber attacks on June 19 that caused the company to shut down most of its systems. Not every dealer uses CDK\u2019s products, and even those that do may not use them for everything, but the system shutdown has been a problem for many. To protect customer privacy, customers\u2019 details typically aren\u2019t written out on a piece of paper that\u2019s just sitting on a desk anymore, my colleagues Ramishah Maruf and Peter Valdes-Dapena report. But with the outage approaching the one-week mark, some dealerships are reverting to old-fashioned methods to avoid missing out on sales during what tends to be one of the busiest times of the year for car shopping. Still, they haven\u2019t been able to access information about deals and customer appointments that were stored within CDK\u2019s servers.

Working its way through the economy Just like the strikes that upended many parts of the economy last summer, the longer the CDK outage goes on, the greater the impact it will have on the US economy. Yes, you read that right. The CDK incident isn\u2019t an isolated event implicating only dealers and buyers. Last month there were $122 billion of transactions at car dealerships, according to Commerce Department estimates. That accounts for 17% of all retail sales in May. An outage lasting through June 30 would mean 10 days without dealership access to CDK. If sales slide even just 10% at the average dealership as a result, total auto retail sales could dip by around $4 billion for the month, according to estimates by Russell Price, chief economist at Ameriprise Financial, based on last month\u2019s retail sales report. But in his view, the average dealership will probably experience a more drastic drop, closer to 40% for each day the outage drags on. If it ends up lasting 10 days, he estimates they\u2019ll lose $16 billion in sales. That, he estimates, would depress total retail sales by 2.3%. Now here\u2019s where it gets even more glaring: Retail sales aren\u2019t just some minor part of the economy. They account for about a third of all consumer spending. And consumer spending is responsible for more than two-thirds of US gross domestic product. So in effect, retail sales are the backbone to the backbone of the economy. By Price\u2019s estimates, a 2.3% decline in retail sales for June would shave nearly a percentage point off the annualized GDP growth rate the second quarter of this year. \u201cThe good news is what we lose in retail sales in June we should make up in July and third-quarter GDP, assuming all systems are back online,\u201d Price told CNN. To add insult to injury Now, again, you might be saying to yourself, \u201cOh I see what\u2019s going on here it\u2019s just a temporary dip that\u2019ll self-correct when everything is working properly again. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m actually going to be hurt.\u201d If only it were so simple\u2026 Investors care a lot about GDP data. It\u2019s like a quarterly check-up on the health of the economy. So it doesn\u2019t tend to sit well with them if it becomes apparent that the economy may be less healthy than anticipated. That\u2019s why there was an ugly stock market selloff in April when the government reported that fourth-quarter GDP fell by much more than economists were expecting. Consider yourself warned: You may want to hold off on looking at your 401(k) on July 25, when the government releases second-quarter GDP estimates.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/business/cdk-outage-economic-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_economy_us-homes-prices-record-high", "text": "Homes in America are the most expensive they\u2019ve ever been, according to one measure. The median price of a previously owned US home climbed for the eleventh consecutive month in May, up 5.8% from a year ago, to $419,300, the National Association of Realtors said Friday. That\u2019s the highest price ever recorded by NAR. \u201cHome prices reaching new highs are creating a wider divide between those owning properties and those who wish to be first-time buyers,\u201d NAR\u2019s chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a release. \u201cStill, first-time buyers in the market understand the long-term benefits of owning.\u201d Housing affordability remains in the gutter: In addition to sky-high home prices, mortgage rates are still higher than anything seen in the decade before 2022. There still aren\u2019t enough homes in the market to keep up with demand, despite some improvements in recent months. The situation could improve somewhat later this year, when the Federal Reserve is expected to begin paring back interest rates from a 23-year high, which should bring down mortgage rates. But Fed officials have penciled in just one rate cut for this year, and the days of ultra-low interest rates are long gone. Economists don\u2019t expect the average mortgage rate to fall below 6% in 2024. Recent research from Zillow shows that in order for a median-income household to afford a monthly mortgage payment on the typical US home, it would need to save up more than $127,000 for a down payment. That\u2019s roughly double the median salary of a US worker. Potential homebuyers are indeed facing a tough market, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be deterring some: Sales of previously owned homes in the US are up from the decades lows in the fall and only edged lower by 0.7% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.11 million. What\u2019s going on with housing supply? When supply doesn\u2019t keep up with demand, it pushes up prices. That\u2019s been the case in the US housing market for decades now. However, there have been some steps in the right direction: Total housing inventory has steadily increased throughout this year, according to NAR data. Inventory at the end of May stood at 1.28 million units, 6.7% higher from April and up 18.5% from a year ago. Homeowners who locked in a low rate before the\u00a0Fed\u00a0began to hike in 2022 have been unwilling or unable to sell their homes because of months of elevated mortgage\u00a0rates. But the recent growth in inventory may mean that homeowners are finally parting with their homes out of necessity because of life events such as marriage, divorce or new children, NAR\u2019s Yun has said. New home construction also contributes to housing supply, but high interest rates seem to have pumped the brakes on homebuilding. Housing starts fell in May to their lowest level since 2020, according to government statistics released Thursday, dropping by 5.5% from April. Building permits, seen as a forward indicator of future construction, came in below economists\u2019 expectations. This story is developing and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/economy/us-homes-prices-record-high/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_business_car-dealership-cdk-cyber-attack", "text": "A CDK Global system outage has affected nearly every aspect of the Mazda dealership in Seekonk, Massachusetts, where Ryan Callahan is general sales manager. He says it won\u2019t be a simple fix. \u201cThe financial impact it will directly have on us will take months to correct, if not years,\u201d Callahan said. Car buyers and dealers are grappling with the shutdown of the retail software provider, which has left nearly 15,000 car dealerships across North America struggling to provide services to customers and scrambling to find temporary analog solutions to operate. CDK says it\u2019s working on restoring its systems and expects them to be back online in several days, but in the interim, customers and dealership employees remain beset by long wait times, delays \u2013 and missed chances to make or save money. Tom McParland, the owner of Automatic Consulting, a national car buying service, said the outage was impacting customers because they have fewer dealers to choose from. \u201cIt reduces their ability to get a deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt limits the customer\u2019s leverage.\u201d Some dealers also can\u2019t apply factory rebates without CDK\u2019s software, so customers may miss out on money-saving deals. For customers looking to buy a car, McParland suggested casting a wide net and shopping outside their local market to find the best price. \u2018They aren\u2019t really able to drive their cars\u2019 Midway Automotive uses a CDK product to register cars with the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles. Owner Michael Deveney says that after the shutdown on Wednesday, the dealership started sending customers to their local RMV office in order to register their cars in person after purchase. \u201cThat was up until Thursday. Then customers started being told that (the RMV) wasn\u2019t taking any walk-ins,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were probably getting flooded with customers and started turning people away.\u201d Deveney said one customer got increasingly agitated because he couldn\u2019t register his car. \u201cGetting an appointment might take three or four days, and in that time they aren\u2019t really able to drive their cars,\u201d he added. Some 30 miles north in Lynn, Katelyn Salvato says she hasn\u2019t been able to register a vehicle since last Tuesday. Salvato works as a title clerk for Pride Motor Group, registering cars for three dealerships. \u201cToday\u2026 I sent 21 registrations to be done manually at the Massachusetts RMV,\u201d she said, adding that the RMV won\u2019t accept transactions from dealership employees. \u201cThe transactions must be dropped off within the designated hours (of 10 am to 3 pm), and the runner can\u2019t wait for them.\u201d  Callahan echoed those concerns. Under normal circumstances, the CDK software allows the dealership to register a vehicle almost instantaneously, but now the process faces heavy delays. \u201cOur remote registration system is rendered useless without CDK to talk to it. We\u2019ve had to send a runner with the registrations to the DMV to be competed in packs, costing several days where prior it took hours,\u201d Callahan said in an interview with CNN. If a vehicle isn\u2019t registered within seven days of purchase, the state penalizes both the dealership and customers. The Massachusetts Department of Transportation, which oversees the state\u2019s RMV, has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Service and sales go analog Salespeople and service employees who spoke with CNN say they\u2019ve resorted to using pen and paper to process purchases, which has drawn out the amount of time it takes to buy a car, according to Scott Campbell, a salesman at Capital City Buick GMC in Berlin, Vermont. He estimates wait times have doubled or tripled. Nicolas, who declined to provide his full name because he was unsure about his employer\u2019s stance on speaking to the media, is a clerk in the parts department of a Porsche dealership in Los Angeles. He said he has been using \u201ca mix of pen and paper, Excel sheets, and extra care for each invoice\u201d since the shutdown. Since many dealerships use CDK products to manage inventory, Nicolas said his department is now forced to manually record inventory parts, which slows their work down significantly. \u201cWe don\u2019t have clear view of stock and have to do regular inventory on our most used parts,\u201d he added. But sometimes the analog workarounds are not enough. Delays at dealerships Several buyers and repair customers tell CNN they\u2019ve experienced long delays. Don Aycock told CNN he drove 90 miles round-trip from his home to a car dealership in Clay County, Florida, to buy a new Buick on Thursday, a day after the CDK shutdown. He told CNN he was able to buy the car but was unable to sign the title. \u201cWe got a call from them today that we can come next Thursday to sign the paperwork for the title and get a permanent license plate,\u201d he said, noting that it will be another lengthy round-trip drive. In San Diego \u2014 where temperatures in recent days have been pushing 90 degrees \u2014 Robbie Jacob and his wife tried to make an appointment at a Kia service center to fix their car\u2019s broken air conditioning unit. Jacob said the center told them it was unable to service the car, citing the CDK cyber incident, as there were no appointments available and all walk-ins were suspended until next week. Other software providers take note CDK Global isn\u2019t the only management system used by dealerships, and the back-to-back cyber incidents affecting the company have put their competitors on high alert, as well. Cox Automotive, which operates the Dealertrack and VinSolutions software systems to manage documents and customer service, told CNN that it temporarily stopped integrating its systems with CDK after the outage \u201cas a precautionary measure to prioritize safety and security for our clients.\u201d \u201cWhile actively supporting our customers to continue to run their business, we established a secure microsite that our customers are actively using now to access support and guidance, work-arounds and actions they can take while CDK systems are not available,\u201d the company said. Tekion, another software company used by dealerships, said it has \u201cseen an increase in inquiries from dealers in light of the recent CDK incident.\u201d And other industry experts told CNN that switching from one system to another is not an action that dealerships can just take on a whim. Businesses are often locked into a multi-year contract with a software provider. Switching software also means training employees, making it a lengthy process. Meanwhile, Asbury Automotive Group, one of America\u2019s largest care retailers and service providers, warned investors Monday that the CDK outage has hurt its business, and it\u2019s unclear when it will end. Rival Group1 Automotive said CDK believed the outage would be resolved in days, not weeks, but it was unclear how much financial damage the company faced as a result.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/business/car-dealership-cdk-cyber-attack/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}

That\u2019s because the economy has consistently ranked among the top \u2014 if not the very top \u2014 voter issues in presidential election after presidential election. The current contest is far from an exception, with close to 90% of respondents in a May ABC News/Ipsos poll indicating that the economy is the most important issue in determining who gets their vote in November. That means it\u2019s all but guaranteed to be a major talking point during Thursday night\u2019s debate, which kicks off at 9 pm ET on CNN. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have polar opposite views on the economy \u2014 and both undoubtedly will try to sell you on their visions, policies and records. To make heads or tails of what they say (or if you\u2019re trying to impress anyone you might be watching the debate with), it\u2019s good to make sure you understand the economy we\u2019re in right now. Disclaimer: The topics below are in no way an exhaustive list of everything going on in the US economy, plus, everyone experiences it differently. Unemployment: Low, but with warning signs ahead The nation\u2019s unemployment rate stayed below 4% for 27 months, its longest such streak and a match for a period in the 1960s. That streak ended last month, when the unemployment rate rose to 4% from 3.9%. At the same time, the number of job openings in the US recently fell to a new three-year low, another sign of cooling in the labor market. That means job seekers might find it harder to get hired. In particular, the job market for recent college graduates has weakened. The unemployment rate for bachelor\u2019s degree recipients aged 20 to 29 is above 12%, an almost four-percentage-point increase from a year ago, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Inflation: Elevated, but cooling Inflation slowed more than expected last month, falling to 3.3% from 3.4% in April. By comparison, at this time last year it was 4%, and two years ago it was 9%. But there\u2019s a reason why you\u2019re probably feeling like everything is still really expensive. While discounts are starting to appear more at big-box retailers like Target and Walmart and fast-food giants like McDonald\u2019s and Wendy\u2019s, price cuts aren\u2019t occurring across the board. That\u2019s because when inflation cools off, it simply means that the pace of price increases is slowing. However, it does not mean that the actual prices we pay for goods and services are lower than they were a year ago. Housing: Still unaffordable Home prices are at a record high and have been climbing for 11 straight months as housing shortages persist. That\u2019s partly because many homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgages during the pandemic don\u2019t want to move and risk having to pay a much higher mortgage rate. Average 30-year fixed-rate mortgages recently hit the highest level of the year. While they\u2019ve started to fall, mortgage rates are still higher than anything seen in the decade before 2022. Mortgage rates are so high in part because inflation is above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. As a result, the central bank has held off cutting interest rates, which would otherwise make it cheaper to get a mortgage. In turn, many would-be homebuyers are renting for longer than they otherwise may have, which is driving rents higher, too.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/business/economy-election-presidential-debate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_business_china-adidas-employees-out-corruption-probe-hnk-intl", "text": "Two employees have left Adidas as a result of an ongoing investigation by the German sportswear brand into allegations of corruption in China. Adidas said last week that it was investigating \u201ccompliance violations\u201d in China, a key market for its sportswear, after Chinese state media reported that the company\u2019s executives in the country had been accused of embezzling millions of euros and taking huge kickbacks. \u201cWhile Adidas is investigating this matter together with independent external advisers, evidence has been found that in the interaction with local vendors, one employee violated the company\u2019s code of conduct,\u201d Claudia Lange, head of media relations at the apparel giant, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cSeparately, a second employee failed to meet the company\u2019s leadership expectations of demonstrating mutual respect and trust,\u201d she said, adding that both had left the company and that the investigation continues. Chinese state media outlet Economic View reported Wednesday that both former employees had worked in marketing for Adidas China. The allegations against Adidas executives were contained in an unsigned letter from people calling themselves employees of Adidas China. The letter was widely publicized online earlier this month and reported by state media outlet Jiemian. Jiemian wrote that the letter had been sent directly to the company\u2019s German headquarters before being shared on social media. Lange told CNN last week that Adidas had received an anonymous letter on June 7 \u201cindicating potential compliance violations in China.\u201d The reported complaint alleged that a senior executive in Greater China who manages Adidas\u2019s marketing budget had embezzled millions of euros and taken kickbacks from external advertising and celebrity agencies. Several members of the executive\u2019s team and other employees were also implicated, according to a copy of the letter published by the Chinese state media outlet. Adidas Greater China\u2019s overall promotional budget amounted to \u20ac250 million ($268 million) a year, including expenses for marketing, branding, and trade fairs, Jiemian reported, citing the letter. The senior manager was also accused of \u201cnepotism\u201d and \u201cworkplace bullying,\u201d including isolating some employees and forcing them to leave, the letter\u2019s authors reportedly said. The complaint also claimed that one of the manager\u2019s subordinates had received \u201cmillions \u2026 from suppliers and physical items such as real estate.\u201d Adidas is the world\u2019s second-largest sportswear retailer. Greater China \u2014 a region that encompasses mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan \u2014 accounts for 15% of the company\u2019s sales. In mainland China, Adidas is the second-largest international sportswear brand behind Nike (NKE). The German company has enjoyed a rebound in sales growth in China since Beijing scrapped Covid restrictions at the end of 2022.

{"id": "2024_06_26_business_volkswagen-recalls-atlas-vehicles", "text": "Volkswagen has recalled 271,330 of its Atlas SUV vehicles due to faulty passenger-side airbags. Certain Atlas vehicles made between 2021 and 2024 and Atlas Cross Sport vehicles made between 2020 and 2024 may experience a wiring error, causing front passenger airbags not to deploy, according to a Wednesday report from the US National Highway and Safety Administration. In March, the German automaker said it would recall 143,000 Atlas SUVs for a similar issue. It is unclear whether Wednesday\u2019s report includes the March recall. Volkswagen did not immediately respond when asked for clarification. In a statement to CNN, Volkswagen said that the car\u2019s seat heaters can have a contact fault with the car\u2019s weight sensors, switching off the passenger airbag even though the seat may be occupied. When this happens, a warning light and sound come from the car\u2019s instrument panel, alerting the driver that the passenger airbag has been turned off. Owners of affected vehicles will by notified by mail on August 16. Once the parts are ready, Volkswagen dealers will replace the faulty parts free of charge, according to the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/business/volkswagen-recalls-atlas-vehicles/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "business"}}
