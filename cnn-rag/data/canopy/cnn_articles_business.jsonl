The regulator said the vehicles failed to comply with the federal safety requirements as their seat belt warning light and audible chime may not get activated when the driver is unbelted. The recall affects certain 2012-2024 Model S, 2015-2024 Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3 and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles. Tesla (TSLA) will release an over-the-air software update to fix the issue, with deployment expected to start in June. The remedy will remove dependency on the driver seat occupancy sensor from the software and only rely on driver seat belt buckle and ignition status to activate the seat belt reminder signals, the NHTSA said. Tesla had recalled 200,000 Model S, X, and Y vehicles in the US in January due to a software malfunction that could obstruct drivers\u2019 visibility while reversing. It also recalled 3,878 Cybertrucks in April to fix an accelerator pedal pad that could come loose and get lodged in the interior trim. US auto safety regulators also opened an investigation last month into whether Tesla\u2019s recall of more than 2 million vehicles announced in December to install new Autopilot safeguards was adequate following a series of crashes.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/business/tesla-recall-faulty-seat-belt-warning-system/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_business_ceo-pay-workers-inequality", "text": "CEOs are raking in fat pay packages as the US stock market booms. Bosses have always made more money than workers. But the gap between CEOs and employees is growing. The median CEO in the S&P 500 was paid 196 times as much as the median employee in 2023, according to an analysis by Equilar and The Associated Press. That\u2019s up from a ratio of 185 in 2022. The widening divide is driven by the fact that CEO pay \u2014 which is closely tied to share prices \u2014 is rising notably faster than that of employees. Many workers, in fact, are struggling to keep up with the cost of living. The jump in 2023 alone was significant. Median total compensation for S&P 500 CEOs (including stock awards) soared to $16.3 million in 2023 \u2014 a huge year-over-year increase of 12.6%, compared to just 0.9% in 2022. Workers made more money, too. But at a much slower pace. The median S&P 500 employee earned $81,467 last year, up 5.2% from 2022, the report said. To put it another way: The annual pay hike amounted to about $4,300 for workers. For CEOs, it was an extra $1.5 million. Those findings are likely frustrating to employees grappling with high costs for everything from groceries and daycare to car insurance. The rate of inflation in the United States has dropped, but it remains above normal. Paychecks are growing faster than prices, a turnaround from 2021 and 2022. Yet workers are still hurting from the cumulative impact of three years of high inflation. Americans are spending $1,015 more per month than they did in 2021 for the same basket of goods and services, according to Moody\u2019s Analytics. That spike in costs almost completely swallows up the increase in incomes, which are up $1,109 per month over that span, Moody\u2019s said. \u201cThe results show that boards and CEOs remain tone deaf related to outrageous pay packages,\u201d Eleanor Bloxham, CEO of The Value Alliance, a firm that advises boards on corporate governance, told CNN. Bloxham said boards and CEOs are \u201cabsolutely responsible\u201d for ensuring that workers share in financial success. \u201cTo not do so puts future earnings at risk because good workers will take action and vote with their feet,\u201d she added. Cashing in on the market boom CEO pay is closely related to the fate of the stock market. Although most CEOs earn a salary and get perks, most of their total compensation is typically from stock rewards. Stock awards made up about 70% of total compensation last year, according to the Equilar study. Given the rising stock market, the median stock award increased by 10.7% to $9.4 million, the report found. Last year, the S&P 500 soared 24% as investors breathed a sigh of relief that the economy did not plunge into a recession and looked forward to potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. The Nasdaq surged by 43% last year, powered by the artificial intelligence boom. Even though the stubborn inflation has prevented the Fed from lowering rates so far this year, the S&P 500 has climbed another 11% since the start of the year to all-time highs.\u00a0That suggests CEO pay packages could get even bigger this year. The $162 million CEO No CEO in the S&P 500 came close to the total pay of Broadcom CEO Hock Tan, who raked in $161.8 million last year. Tan\u2019s massive payday was fueled almost entirely by stock awards after Broadcom\u2019s share price nearly doubled last year. The Broadcom CEO\u2019s compensation doubled in 2023, leaving him with 510 times the median salary of employees at the company. The next-closest CEO in terms of pay last year was FICO CEO William Lansing, according to Equilar. Lansing\u2019s total compensation hit $66.3 million last year. Apple CEO Tim Cook was the third-highest paid CEO in the S&P 500, raking in $63.2 million last year, 672 times that of the median Apple employee\u2019s pay of $94,118. The pay gap is even starker at some companies that rely on hourly, part-time workers. For instance, Barbara Rentler, the CEO of clothing retailer Ross Stores, received $18.1 million in total compensation last year. The median Ross employee \u2014 a part-time hourly retail store associate \u2014 made $8,618. That means Rentler made 2,100 times as much as her median employee.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/business/ceo-pay-workers-inequality/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash", "text": "Cesar Conde has a decision to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not an especially difficult one. The NBCUniversal News Group chair is facing a torrent of backlash from his own staff after greenlighting the hire of former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel as a paid network contributor. Over the last 24 hours, the most prominent and recognizable NBC News and MSNBC personalities have voiced strong displeasure with the company\u2019s decision to welcome McDaniel to \u201cthe team.\u201d And they\u2019re not doing it via anonymous comments to the press. They\u2019re doing it on the record on NBCU\u2019s own air. Chuck Todd broke the dam on Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with a set of candid comments about the hiring, and Rachel Maddow capped the flood of backlash Monday night with a blistering 30-minute monologue eviscerating the network\u2019s leadership for the \u201cinexplicable\u201d move. Suffice to say, NBCU News Group is in unprecedented territory. Never has a network\u2019s C-suite ever been so thoroughly flogged by its most high-profile stars in such no holds barred fashion. Saying that Conde simply has a crisis on his hands would be a contender for understatement of the year. It\u2019s a five-alarm fire at NBCU News Group, and one of Conde\u2019s own making. While NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown were most directly responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring, a decision that MSNBC boss Rashida Jones did not object to it at the time, the buck ultimately stops with Conde, who hold the real power at the Peacock Network. McDaniel\u2019s hiring could not have happened without Conde\u2019s blessing. It does not take a brilliant political mind with prescient foresight to understand that hiring McDaniel would ignite a firestorm of outrage \u2014 from both within 30 Rock and outside it. Conde, someone who ostensibly supports American democracy, should have rejected McDaniel\u2019s hiring on the grounds that NBCU News Group could not put someone on its payroll who tried to subvert the 2020 vote. As so many of NBCU\u2019s staffers have underscored, the objection to McDaniel is not that she is a Republican. It\u2019s not even that she is a Donald Trump-supporting Republican. It\u2019s that she was an active participant in the plot to overthrow the last presidential election. That is not to even mention McDaniel\u2019s years of demonizing the press, smearing the journalists who work at NBC News and MSNBC as she sought to destroy the credibility of the organization that she ran to after being chased out of the RNC. The notion put forward by NBC that it needed to hire McDaniel to bring its viewers \u201can insider\u2019s perspective on national politics and the future of the Republican Party\u201d is absurd. If that\u2019s the case, the network should move to hire free agents like Tucker Carlson or Candace Owens. They too have their hands on the pulse of the Republican Party. In fact, they represent much more of where the GOP stands today than McDaniel. So, using NBC\u2019s logic, why not hire them? (Spoiler: News organizations rightfully have established basic standards for paid contributors. Asking that your employees have a commitment to democracy, to the truth, and to basic decency is not a big ask.) But even if Conde has no allegiance to basic democratic principles, which this hire calls into question, given that he is known to be a political player who cares deeply about his own image in the press, he should have been wise enough to foresee that hiring McDaniel would be an ill-conceived move. How this did not occur to Conde is unfathomable and shows a tremendous lack of judgment. Even more bizarre is Conde\u2019s management, or lack thereof, since the controversy erupted. It was clear early on that his employees at NBC News and MSNBC did not support McDaniel\u2019s hiring. If that was not evident on Friday, it was clear as day on Sunday after \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The network\u2019s employees were not only flabbergasted and demoralized by the move, but absolutely enraged by it. At that point, the writing should have been on the wall for Conde \u2014 as it was for every other media executive that I have spoken with over the last 24 hours. It is evident that McDaniel has no real future as an NBC analyst and the decision to bring her on as a contributor will have to be reversed. After all, which NBC or MSNBC program is going to invite her on after all of this? The only real question for Conde after the Sunday morning scolding should have been how he chose to back out of the deal in the least painful way possible. To be fully honest, I very much expected a Sunday evening announcement from NBC, one that would have earned praise from the company\u2019s staff and quickly been swept away by the rush of Trump news Monday morning. But no such announcement came. Instead, Conde has allowed the mess to spiral absolutely out of control. MSNBC\u2019s top stars hammered the network\u2019s leadership throughout the day Monday over the hire. NBC News\u2019 Guild blasted Conde, saying in a statement that under him the company had quietly laid off employees over the last month and instead chosen to \u201cprioritize an election denier over its reporters.\u201d The already severe crisis was allowed to blossom into one of the worst corporate public relations catastrophes in recent memory. All the while, Conde has remained silent. I asked his spokesperson, Stephen Labaton, on Monday whether the NBCU News Group boss had any comment on the situation. Does he have any regret? I didn\u2019t get an on-the-record response. Suffice to say, however, that what Conde does moving forward will say a lot about his character and commitment to democratic values. It will also say a lot about the NBCU News Group and what type of organization it is. In her biting monologue on Monday night, however, Maddow did offer Conde a way out of this mess. \u201cMistakes will be made,\u201d Maddow said.\u201dBut our resilience as a democracy is going to be recognizing when decisions are bad ones and reversing those bad decisions. Hearing legitimate criticism, responding to it, and correcting course. Not digging in. Not blaming others. Take a minute. Acknowledge that maybe it wasn\u2019t the right call.\u201d \u201cIt is a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge when you are wrong,\u201d Maddow added. \u201cIt is a sign of strength. And our country needs us to be strong now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-cesar-conde-ronna-mcdaniel-backlash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_15_success_best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund", "text": "The average federal tax refund is more than $3,000, according to the latest data from the IRS. Since the majority of tax filers get a refund, there\u2019s a fair chance you could get hundreds if not thousands of dollars back in overpaid taxes, especially if you\u2019re also owed a refund from your state government. That money may feel like a windfall, and it\u2019s easy to squander it on a lot of little things. But if you\u2019re looking to improve your current financial situation, here are seven ideas to consider. Well, technically six, but you\u2019ll enjoy the seventh the most. 1. Pay off high-rate debt If you are carrying a balance on your credit card and are paying 20% to 30% in interest, make this your first priority to pay down. At such sky-high rates, \u201cthe debt can grow faster than you can pay it off,\u201d said Eric Bronnenkant, a certified financial planner and head of tax at Betterment, a robo-advisory financial services firm that also has a human advice team on hand to help clients. Keyana Russ, a certified financial planner at Four Ponds Financial Planning, concurred that people\u2019s awareness of how much money they\u2019re paying in interest over time doesn\u2019t always register. \u201cWhat I usually see is people paying the minimum, or they\u2019re charging everyday expenses and not paying off the bill at the end of the month. \u2026 They don\u2019t understand how much interest they\u2019re paying,\u201d Russ said. For example, if you\u2019re carrying a $3,000 balance at 27% interest and you only pay a required minimum of $97.50 every month, it will take you 240 months (which is 20 years) just to pay off the $3,000 \u2014 and, in addition, you will have paid $3,044.57 in interest, for a total of $6,044.57, according to Bankrate.com\u2019s calculator. 2. Create or add to an emergency fund You can use your refund to start or bolster an emergency fund. When it comes to costly emergencies, there are many Americans who don\u2019t have at least three months\u2019 worth of living expenses set aside, let alone enough to easily handle an unexpected bill of $1,000. Be sure to stash the money in a high-yield savings account at an FDIC-insured bank, Russ suggested, noting that the best interest rates are typically offered by online banks. If you have high-rate debt and you\u2019re lacking emergency savings, Russ suggested you might use a portion of your refund to attack your debt and the other portion to create an emergency fund. Bronnenkant favors paying off the high-rate debt first, but, if you\u2019re low on emergency savings and need a critical repair to help keep your job \u2014 such as on your car \u2014 he said it might make sense to set aside money for that repair and put the rest toward your credit card or other high-rate debt. 3. Make an extra payment on your mortgage If you\u2019re carrying a mortgage at a high rate (e.g., 7% to 8%), and you\u2019re not saddled with credit card debt, you might consider making an extra payment or two. \u201cIt can make a difference in the long run towards your principal,\u201d Russ said.\u00a0 You can even view it as an additional form of savings, in the sense that you\u2019re saving yourself an extra 7% \ufeffor so in interest on the portion of the principal you\u2019re paying down, Bronnenkant noted. 4. Invest in a Roth IRA If your income qualifies you to contribute to a Roth IRA, you can contribute up to $7,000 this year ($8,000 if you\u2019re at least 50) with after-tax savings. That money will grow untaxed until retirement, at which point your withdrawals will be tax-free and penalty-free after age 59-1/2, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. (And note: You can still make a 2023 Roth contribution until April 15 this year. The contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. Bolstering your tax-free retirement savings is great.\u00a0But if you need to access some of your money well before you retire, you may take out any part of your contributions tax-free and penalty-free at any time, \ufeffBronnenkant said. You would only be taxed and penalized if you withdrew the earnings on your contributions before age 59-1/2. (For more information on Roth IRA withdrawal rules, here is an easy-to-understand rundown from Charles Schwab.) 5. Contribute enough to your 401(k) in 2024 to get your full employer match Speaking of retirement savings, if you\u2019re not yet contributing enough to your 401(k) to get the full match from your employer, a refund can make that easier. Say you get $3,000 back. You can put that money in a high-yield savings account to earn interest. Then, on your workplace 401(k) site, change your paycheck contribution levels so that by the end of the year you will have contributed $3,000 more in pre-tax money than you otherwise would have. For instance, say you\u2019re paid every two weeks and you have 20 more paychecks left until the end of the year. You can boost you biweekly contributions by $150 per paycheck ($150 x 20 = $3,000). \u201cYou want to get the max match from your employer,\u201d Bronnenkant said. 6. Invest for shorter-term goals If in the next three to 10 years you expect to buy a home, take a once-in-a-lifetime trip, renovate a room, send your kids to summer camp or have any other expensive goal, you might consider investing your refund in a diversified mix of low-cost, broad market index funds. The shorter term your goal is, the less risk you want to take. If you need the money within three years, you might consider putting your refund in certificates of deposits and US Treasury bonds. But if your goal is five to 10 years out, and you\u2019re comfortable taking on some more risk and are willing to accept fluctuations in the market, Bronnenkant said, you might put no more than 30% of your refund in a stock index fund and 70% in a total market bond fund if your risk tolerance is conservative; or 50% in each if you have a moderate risk tolerance. If you plan on sending your child to college and you have a 529 plan, you can use your refund to boost your contributions to that plan, Russ said. You may also get a tax break for your contribution depending on the state where you live. 7. Have some fun Unless you\u2019re in truly dire financial straits, if you get a large refund, you might set aside a small portion to do whatever you truly enjoy. \u201cSometimes you just want to have fun and not have it be all business,\u201d Russ said. \u201cYou can set aside some of the money to have fun.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/15/success/best-ways-to-use-your-tax-refund/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_business_india-gdp-q4-growth-intl-hnk", "text": "India\u2019s economy grew\u00a0by more than 8% in the fiscal year that ended in March, according to data published Friday that gives a boost to Prime Minister Narendra Modi just hours before the country concludes its mammoth, weeks-long national election. Gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 8.2%, according to the Statistics Ministry, cementing India\u2019s status as the world\u2019s fastest growing major economy. The rate of growth was higher than the Modi government\u2019s forecast of 7.6%. For the final quarter of the fiscal year, GDP expanded at a faster-than-expected rate of 7.8%, compared with the same period in 2023. GDP\u00a0had risen by 8.6% in the October-December period. \u201cWe expect economic activity to moderate a bit further over the coming quarters, but India will remain a global outperformer,\u201d said Ankita Amajuri, assistant economist at Capital Economics. There\u2019s less than 24 hours to go before polls close in the election. Modi is running on his economic record over the past 10 years, a period of robust growth for India. The country went from the ninth largest economy in the world to the fifth largest during that time. It also experienced the largest percentage growth in GDP over the decade compared to other major economies. Results will be declared on June 4. If Modi wins a third term, \u201cany deceleration (in the economy) will be mild,\u201d added Amajuri. Sustained expansion will push India higher up the ranks of the world\u2019s biggest economies, with some observers forecasting the country to become number three behind only the US and China by 2027. India is widely seen as an alternative to China for countries and companies looking to diversify their supply chains, particularly as the relationship between Washington and Beijing sours. Some of the world\u2019s biggest companies, including Apple (AAPL) supplier Foxconn, are already expanding their operations there. \u201cAfter China, India is the only economy that can achieve economies of scale, due to its large market,\u201d wrote Nomura economists in a report earlier this week. \u201cIndia is one of the few economies that is garnering investor interest across a variety of sectors,\u201d they added. Despite the euphoria surrounding the growth figures, economists say there are enormous challenges facing the Indian economy in the next decade. The new government will have to create hundreds of millions of jobs for a population that remains largely impoverished. With an average age of 29 years, India\u2019s population is one of the youngest globally, but the country is not yet able to reap the potential economic benefits from its youthful demographics. According to a recent report by the International Labour Organization, educated Indians between the ages of 15 and 29 are more likely to be unemployed than those without any schooling, which reflects \u201ca mismatch with their aspirations and available jobs.\u201d Youth unemployment rates in India are now higher than global levels, it said. Analysts fear that if Modi\u2019s party underperforms in the polls, it may put key land and labor reforms on the backburner. But one of the biggest long-term threats facing the Indian economy is climate change. The country is particularly vulnerable to extreme heat and some places there are pushing the limits of human survivability, experts say. Earlier this week, India\u2019s capital territory of Delhi recorded its highest-ever temperature of 49.9 degrees Celsius (121.8 degrees Fahrenheit), and the oppressive heat wave forced authorities to impose water rationing. Rising mercury levels in India risks reversing progress on poverty alleviation, health and economic growth, experts say. The country is\u00a0\u201cexpected to lose about 5.8% of daily working hours due\u00a0to heat stress in 2030,\u201d said a\u00a0United Nations\u2019\u00a0Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific\u00a0(ESCAP) report in April. \u201cThe problem is most\u00a0severe for outdoor workers, particularly those employed in agriculture and construction, but also relevant for indoor\u00a0factory workers,\u201d it added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/business/india-gdp-q4-growth-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}

Soccer superstar Lionel Messi has partnered with White Claw\u2019s parent company to create a new hydration beverage, marking his entrance into the $33 billion category dominated by entrenched competitors Paul\u2019s Prime, Gatorade and BodyArmor that have been vying for consumers\u2019 growing thirst for energy drinks. Despite Messi\u2019s star power, the drink still faces a challenging market, with longstanding competitors. And the drink is also a new foray into non-alcoholic drinks for Mark Anthony Brands, as Americans consume less alcohol. M\u00e1s+ by Messi is a low-sugar drink containing electrolytes and vitamins without artificial sweeteners, colors or caffeine. It comes in four flavors including Miami Punch for his current team Inter Miami and Orange d\u2019Or, a nod to the eight times he won the prestigious Ballon d\u2019Or trophy. The drink, available in cans and bottles, will first be released in Miami on June 13 followed later by a larger rollout on its website in July and to US supermarkets in August. A global launch is planned for later this year. Since Messi\u2019s arrival to Major League Soccer, the league said that it has seen its sponsorship revenue grow 15% to $587 million, with some big names like Celsius becoming its official energy drink. The league didn\u2019t immediately comment on the potential new rival from Messi. The drink is part of a new non-alcoholic beverage unit for Mark Anthony Brands, the owner of White Claw and Mike\u2019s Hard Lemonade. The company has been expanding its portfolio with new non-alcoholic options, including White Claw 0% Alcohol Seltzer, as consumers dial back drinking and the categories blur. Hydration and energy drinks are projected to be a $60 billion market by 2032, growing roughly 6% annually,\u00a0according to Precedence Research. Still, attaching Messi\u2019s name to a beverage doesn\u2019t guarantee success, since it\u2019s a competitive category dominated by established competitors, according to Andrea Hern\u00e1ndez, founder of Snaxshot, a food and beverage insights platform. \u201cThe category is saturated, so it all comes down to price parity and distribution, assuming Messi has secured some good deals to try and actually compete with not only Prime but also Gatorade, BodyArmor and others,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cThe only advantage they carry is tied to Messi\u2019s image.\u201d However, his \u201cfandom extends wide, and he\u2019s almost hero-like for new generation of upcoming athletes, particularly\u00a0in a massive market like Latin America,\u201d she said, adding that Prime\u2019s popularity and distribution hasn\u2019t yet extended to that region. She also notes that the Messi\u2019s drinks are using cane sugar, a new trend with beverages since some zero sugar drinks are turning off some people because of its taste. \u201cPeople forget having a good tasting product also goes a long way,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cGen Alpha is up for grabs, and that is who these new generation energy drinks are aiming to capture especially as they enter teenage years.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/food/leo-messi-sports-drink/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}

It\u2019s one of the first such settlements reached as the university faces lawsuits and investigations from Jewish, Palestinian, Arab and pro-Palestinian students for allegedly failing to protect them after the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel heightened tensions on US college campuses. In late April, a lawsuit from the anonymous student said that their education had been disrupted by a hostile environment on campus, when pro-Palestinian protesters put up encampments on Columbia\u2019s lawn protesting Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and also occupied Hamilton Hall, a building on campus. As part of the settlement, Columbia said it is providing 24/7 walking escorts and safe entrances to campus. The settlement also said the school agreed to provide accommodations\u00a0\u201cfor students who were displaced from campus and couldn\u2019t finish exams or other important assignments\u201d after Columbia announced a hybrid learning model in late April. Columbia also created a \u201cSafe Passage Liaison,\u201d who will manage and coordinate the safe passage escorts. \u201cWe are pleased we\u2019ve been able to come to a resolution and remain committed to our number one priority: the safety of our campus so that all of our students can successfully pursue their education and meet their academic goals,\u201d a university spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

We are committed to making Columbia safe for everyone, and to ensuring that you feel welcome and valued.\u201d In late April, Palestine Legal also filed a civil rights complaint with the US Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, requesting an investigation into Columbia\u2019s treatment of Palestinian and pro-Palestinian students. The complaint alleged that for months, these students had \u201cbeen the target of extreme anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab, and Islamophobic harassment, including receiving multiple death threats, being harassed for wearing keffiyehs or hijab, doxed, stereotyped, being treated differently by high-ranking administrators.\u201d Columbia has three active Title VI investigations with the OCR since the encampment went up in April.

{"id": "2022_04_25_business_electric-hybrid-corvette", "text": "General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.  Reuss didn\u2019t say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. \u201cWe will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,\u201d he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only. While Reuss\u2019s post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it\u2019s not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model. \u201cElectrified\u201d is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as \u201celectrified.\u201d It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette, the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car. Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla\u2019s first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production. Some manufacturers, such as Lamborghini, have said that current battery technology doesn\u2019t allow for a optimum sports car performance from a purely electric vehicle. Lamborghini has been working on plug-in hybrid sports cars, though. To date, the Corvette is only available in the base Stingray version with 6.2-liter V8 engine producing up to 495 horsepower. A 670 horsepower Corvette Z06 with a 5.5-liter V8 was unveiled last fall. The previous generation of the Corvette included included a 755-horsepower ZR1 version. Nothing like that has yet been announced for the current model but GM engineers have said a major reason for putting the engine in the back was to allow for better performance at extremely high horsepower levels. Besides saving gas, hybrid systems can also be used in high-performance cars to add additional power and to provide for quicker acceleration since electric motors can provide power to the wheels more quickly than gas engines. Ferrari\u2019s most powerful sports cars are hybrids, for instance.   GM has said it plans to produce only zero-emission vehicles, meaning fully electric or powered by hydrogen fuel cells, by 2035.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_tech_new-yorks-social-media-algorithm-block", "text": "New York could soon become the first state to pass a law restricting social media platforms from using algorithms to promote content to minors. New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and state lawmakers are nearing a legislative deal on the proposal, according to a person familiar with the matter. The bill would push platforms such as TikTok and Meta\u2019s Instagram to rank content in chronological order by default for young users. That could mean significant changes to how kids in New York interact with social media apps and would make algorithmically generated content feeds an opt-in experience requiring parental consent. The looming legislative agreement also includes a separate measure that seeks to protect children\u2019s privacy, the person added. As currently written, that bill would restrict websites from collecting or sharing\u00a0the personal data of users under 18 without consent, expanding on existing federal privacy protections for children under 13. A tentative deal on the social media bill was earlier reported by\u00a0The Wall Street Journal. The agreement covering children\u2019s privacy has not been previously reported. In addition to clamping down on algorithmic content feeds, the social media legislation would also force platforms to let parents set tougher limits on their kids\u2019 social media use, such as during nights, and to set limits on app notifications that technology critics say keep users hooked. Both pieces of legislation were\u00a0introduced last fall. State lawmakers could vote as soon as this week, according to the Journal. As the bills have progressed, state lawmakers have been the target of intense tech industry lobbying \u2014 mirroring the legislative battles in states such as Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, and many others that have pushed to pass laws clamping down on social media companies. Industry groups have challenged some of the legislation coming out of those other states, in many cases arguing that they infringe on the First Amendment rights of teens to access lawful information. In Ohio this year, a federal judge temporarily blocked a law that prohibits online platforms from creating accounts for users under 16 unless they obtain parental consent, saying the legislation is likely unconstitutional. New York officials have said their proposal is about regulating how platforms can display content, not blocking user access. \u201cWe\u2019re not banning young people from social media,\u201d Hochul said in an\u00a0interview on NPR Monday. \u201cNot at all.

{"id": "2022_04_27_business_diamonds-manmade-demand", "text": "It\u2019s proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales. Not that you\u2019d know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag. \u201cThe result is really stunning,\u201d said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst. He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period. Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.  \u201cThe big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,\u201d he said. Too late. \u201cIt\u2019s actually happening.\u201d  Tide is shifting Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said. \u201cThis is substantially less \u2013 as much as 73% cheaper \u2013 than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,\u201d he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.  \u201cA lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,\u201d said Golan. \u201cNatural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn\u2019t an infinite supply of them.\u201d  This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds. The sanctions directly target Alrosa, partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world\u2019s largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output. Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious. Mined diamonds have a controversial history that\u2019s tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d that fund conflict in war-torn areas. Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot. Small but growing share of the diamond market Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small. Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.  Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world\u2019s largest jewelry company, Pandora\n            \n                (PANDY), made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.  Pandora said it\u2019s instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it. Signet,\n            \n                (SIG) the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts. Calling it a \u201cfast-growing category\u201d in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.  The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.  Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don\u2019t just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it. \u201cAs the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn\u2019t surprising,\u201d said Don O\u2019Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. \u201c[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they\u2019re conflict-free. They\u2019re embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.\u201d Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting. There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.  So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won\u2019t get much for it.  But the value of a ring isn\u2019t just monetary. \u201cAs a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,\u201d said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. \u201cI always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}

The probe is yet another complication for the social media platform, which is already facing the threat of a potential US ban or a forced divestment from its Chinese parent company. The sources said that the FTC is probing TikTok over an alleged violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection rule, which requires companies to notify parents and obtain consent before collecting data from children under 13. The agency is also investigating whether TikTok violated a portion of the FTC Act that prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices, the sources said, in denying that TikTok user data could be accessed by individuals in China. The FTC could bring a suit against TikTok or settle with the company in the coming weeks, according to one of the sources. Politico reported news of the probe earlier. When asked about the investigation, FTC Director of Public Affairs Douglas Farrar replied: \u201cNo comment.\u201d TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC probe comes as TikTok faces an existential threat in the US. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group in the US House of Representatives voted to pass a law forcing TikTok to be sold by ByteDance or face a ban from US app stores. The bill is now before the Senate, and President Joe Biden has said he would sign it if it gets to his desk. Senate leaders, however, have indicated they are taking a deliberate approach \u2014\u00a0which could lead to delays or even potentially doom the House bill. The short-form video company, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, has denied assertions that its app poses a national security threat to US citizens. TikTok, which does not operate in China, has said that the Chinese government has never accessed US user data. Cybersecurity experts say Chinese laws require ByteDance to cooperate with that country\u2019s intelligence demands\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a fact that, given ByteDance\u2019s ownership of TikTok, could hypothetically put US user data at risk. To address that issue, TikTok has taken steps to store its US user data on cloud servers controlled by US tech giant Oracle and established internal protocols limiting access by non-US employees. TikTok acknowledged to Congress in 2022 that employees based in China could access US user data, following a report that year by BuzzFeed News that ByteDance employees had accessed that information on multiple occasions. TikTok CEO Shou Chew, in his first appearance before Congress last year, also acknowledged that several ByteDance employees were fired for spying on certain US journalists as part of a \u201cmisguided attempt\u201d to hunt down leakers within the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/ftc-tiktok-probe-privacy-and-security/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}

News organizations across the world are grappling with how to take advantage of the\u00a0rapidly developing technology, while also not being overrun by it. But experts warn that relying too heavily on AI could wreck\u00a0the\u00a0credibility\u00a0of news organizations and potentially supercharge the spread of misinformation if not kept in close check. Media companies integrating AI in news publishing have also seen it backfire, resulting in public embarrassments. Tech outlet CNET\u2019s AI-generated articles made embarrassing factual errors. The nation\u2019s largest newspaper chain owner, Gannett, pulled back on an AI experiment reporting on high school sports games after public mockery. Sports Illustrated deleted several articles from its website after they were found to have been published under fake author names. Hoodline,\u00a0founded in 2014 as a San Francisco-based hyper-local news outlet\u00a0with a mission\u00a0\u201cto cover the\u00a0news deserts\u00a0that no one else is covering,\u201d\u00a0once employed a newsroom full of\u00a0human journalists.\u00a0The outlet has since expanded into a national network of local websites, covering news and events in major cities across the country and drawing millions of readers each month, the company said. But last year, Hoodline began filling its site with AI-generated articles. A disclaimer page linked at the bottom of its pages notes to readers,\u00a0\u201cWhile AI may assist in the background, the essence of our journalism \u2014 from conception to publication \u2014 is driven by real human insight and discretion.\u201d Zachary Chen,\u00a0chief executive of\u00a0Hoodline parent company Impress3, which\u00a0acquired the site in 2020, defended the\u00a0site\u2019s\u00a0use of AI and its\u00a0transparency with readers, telling CNN the\u00a0outlet\u00a0provides valuable reporting in\u00a0news deserts\u00a0around the country\u00a0and is generating revenue to hire more\u00a0human\u00a0journalists\u00a0in the future. Hoodline\u2019s staff includes \u201cdozens of editors, as well as dozens of journalist researchers, full time,\u201d Chen said. The outlet also employs a \u201cgrowing number of on-the-ground journalists who research and write original stories about their neighborhood beats,\u201d\u00a0he added, referencing\u00a0recent articles about restaurants,\u00a0retail\u00a0stores and events\u00a0in the\u00a0San Francisco\u00a0area. Bios for bots But until recently, the site had further blurred the line between reality and illusion. Screenshots captured last year by\u00a0the Internet Archive and local outlet Gazetteer\u00a0showed Hoodline had\u00a0further embellished its AI author bylines with\u00a0what appeared to be AI-generated headshots resembling real people and fake biographical information. \u201cNina is a long-time writer and a Bay Area Native who writes about good food & delicious drink, tantalizing tech & bustling business,\u201d one biography claimed. The\u00a0fake headshots and biographies\u00a0have since\u00a0been removed from the\u00a0site,\u00a0replaced with a small \u201cAI\u201d badge next to\u00a0each\u00a0machine-assisted\u00a0article\u2019s byline, though they still carry\u00a0human\u00a0names. The archived screenshots have also been wiped from much of the internet. Wayback Machine director Mark Graham told CNN\u00a0that archived pages of Hoodline\u2019s AI writers were removed last month \u201cat the request of the rights holder of the site.\u201d Chen acknowledged the company requested that the archive\u2019s screenshots of the site be removed from the internet, saying\u00a0\u201csome websites have taken outdated screenshots from months or even years ago to mischaracterize our present-day practices.\u201d \u201cAn empty gesture toward transparency\u201d But experts expressed alarm over Hoodline\u2019s practices, warning that\u00a0it\u00a0exemplifies the potential pitfalls and perils of using AI in journalism, threatening to diminish public trust in news. The way the site uses and discloses AI purposely tricks readers by \u201cmimicking\u201d the look and feel of a \u201cstandards-based local news organization with real journalists,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Peter Adams, a senior vice president of the News Literacy Project, which aims to\u00a0educate the public on identifying credible information. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of flagrantly opaque way to dupe people into thinking that they\u2019re reading actual reporting by an actual journalist who has a concern for being fair, for being accurate, for being transparent,\u201d Adams\u00a0told CNN. The small \u201cAI\u201d badge\u00a0that now appears\u00a0next to fake\u00a0author personas on the site is \u201can empty gesture toward transparency rather than actually exercising transparency,\u201d Adams\u00a0added. Chen\u00a0would\u00a0not disclose what AI system Hoodline\u00a0is employing, only calling it \u201cour own proprietary and custom-built software, combined with the most cutting-edge AI partners to craft publish-ready, fact-based article.\u201d Each article, Chen said, is overseen by editors before it is published. Gazetteer previously reported that at least two\u00a0Hoodline\u00a0employees said\u00a0on LinkedIn\u00a0that they\u00a0were based in the Philippines,\u00a0far from the US cities that the outlet purports to cover.\u00a0Chen\u00a0did not respond to CNN\u2019s\u00a0question\u00a0about its staff or where they are located. The\u00a0News/Media\u00a0Alliance, which represents more than 2,200 US publishers, has supported\u00a0news organizations\u00a0taking legal action against AI developers who are harvesting\u00a0news\u00a0content without permission.\u00a0Danielle Coffey,\u00a0the\u00a0group\u2019s chief executive, told CNN that Hoodline\u2019s content \u201cis likely a violation of copyright law.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s another example of stealing our content without permission and without compensation to then turn around and compete with the original work,\u201d Coffey said. \u201cWithout quality news in the first place, this type of content among other practices will become unsustainable over time, as quality news will simply disappear.\u201d Chen told CNN he takes copyright\u00a0law\u00a0very seriously and that\u00a0the outlet has\u00a0\u201cgreatly refined processes with heavy guardrails.\u201d\u00a0The site\u2019s readers, he asserted,\u00a0\u201cappreciate the unbiased nature of our AI-assisted news,\u201d and claimed Hoodline\u2019s visitor traffic has soared twentyfold since the publication was acquired. (Chen did not specify their traffic numbers.) That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t a place for AI in a newsroom. It can\u00a0assist journalists\u00a0in research and data processing and\u00a0reduce costs\u00a0in an industry\u00a0struggling\u00a0with tighter budgets.\u00a0Some news organizations, like News Corp., are increasingly inking lucrative partnerships with AI developers like OpenAI\u00a0to help bolster its large language models\u2019 knowledge base. But Hoodline\u2019s use of\u00a0machine-written articles under seemingly human names is not the way to do it, said Felix Simon,\u00a0a\u00a0research fellow in AI and digital news at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford. \u201cEmploying AI to help local journalists save time so they can focus on doing more in-depth investigations is qualitatively different from churning out a high amount of low-quality stories that do nothing to provide people with timely and relevant information about what is happening in their community, or that provides\u00a0them with a better understanding of how the things happening around them will end up affecting them,\u201d Simon told CNN. Research conducted by Simon\u00a0and\u00a0Benjamin Toff, a journalism professor at the University of Minnesota, has also found that the public has not embraced the use of AI in news reporting. \u201cWe found that people are somewhat less trusting of news labelled as AI, and there is reason to believe that people won\u2019t be as willing to pay for news generated purely with AI,\u201d he said. Keeping local news alive On\u00a0Hoodline\u2019s\u00a0network of local news sites, it is difficult to find an article not written by the software.\u00a0Much of the\u00a0site\u2019s content\u00a0appears to be\u00a0rewritten\u00a0directly from press releases,\u00a0social media postings\u00a0or aggregated from\u00a0other news organizations.\u00a0Chen\u00a0said the outlet aims to\u00a0\u201calways provide proper attribution\u201d and follow \u201cfair use\u201d practices. \u201cLocal news has been on a terrible downward trend for two decades, and as we expand, Hoodline is able to bring local stories that provide insight into what\u2019s going on at a hyper-local level, even in so-called \u2018news deserts,\u2019\u201d Chen said. The outlet, which is profitable,\u00a0Chen said, plans to hire more human journalists as the company looks\u00a0to\u00a0evolve\u00a0its\u00a0current AI personas into \u201cAI news anchors delivering stories in short-form videos.\u201d The plan will make use of the fake bylines published on the site, eventually turning them into AI news readers, he said. \u201cIt would not make sense for an AI news anchor to be named \u2018Hoodline San Francisco\u2019 or \u2018Researched by Person A & Edited by Persona B.\u2019 This is what we are building toward,\u201d Chen said. Nuala Bishari,\u00a0a former Hoodline reporter,\u00a0wrote in\u00a0a recent column\u00a0for the San Francisco Chronicle that seeing her old job replaced by AI is \u201csurreal.\u201d \u201cOld-fashioned shoe-leather reporting has been replaced by fake people who\u2019ve never set foot in any of the neighborhoods they write about \u2014 because they don\u2019t have feet,\u201d Bishari wrote. But the transformation at Hoodline shows that bigger solutions are needed to keep vital local news reporting alive. \u201cWithout a big shift, journalism as we know it will continue to sputter out,\u201d she wrote.\u201cAnd it isn\u2019t just tiny outlets like Hoodline that are in danger of going extinct or being zombified by AI.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/media/ai-bylines-local-news-hoodline/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2023_11_21_opinions_sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic", "text": "The biggest tech news this week is the\u00a0ouster\u00a0of Sam Altman from his role as CEO of OpenAI, a move that has shaken the company and the industry. Hundreds of OpenAI employees have threatened to\u00a0resign. Altman has already\u00a0moved on\u00a0to a role at Microsoft. And OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is on its\u00a0third CEO\u00a0in as many days. It\u2019s all very juicy. But this drama should also be raising larger questions, far beyond one company\u2019s internal hirings and firings, including: Who are the people making the decisions\u00a0that will determine so much of our technological future? What guiding principles are they using to make those decisions? And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_19_success_wall-street-bonuses", "text": "Last year wasn\u2019t the most lucrative for Wall Street bankers, but their bonus payouts still easily trounced US median household income. The average Wall Street bonus for 2023 was $176,500, according to estimates that will be released Tuesday morning by New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. That\u2019s down 2% from the $180,000 recorded in 2022. Both those averages were well below the $240,000 paid out in 2021. That the average bonus was slightly down isn\u2019t surprising. Wall Street earnings last year were mixed, and merger and acquisition activity was underwhelming. \u201cWall Street\u2019s profits were up 1.8% in 2023, but firms have taken a more cautious approach to compensation and more employees have joined the securities industry, which accounts for the slight decline in the average bonus,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement. Nevertheless, a little perspective: The average Wall Street bonus, which comes on top of the nearly half-a-million-dollar average Wall Street salary, was itself almost 2.5 times higher than the median US household income of $74,580, according to Census data for 2022. Wall Street bonuses and general employment in the securities industry provide vital revenue streams for the New York State and New York City economies, accounting most recently for 27% of the state\u2019s tax collections and 7% of city tax revenue, according to DiNapoli\u2019s office. The securities industry \ufeffin the city employed roughly 198,500 people last year, up from 191,600 the year before. And DiNapoli estimates that 1 in 11 of the city\u2019s jobs are either directly or indirectly associated with the industry. The total estimated bonus pool for 2023 was\u00a0slightly lower than the year before and is\u00a0projected to bring in $4 million less in state income tax revenue and $2 million less for the city revenue than bonuses in 2022 did. Still, DiNapoli noted, \u201cWhile these bonuses affect income tax revenues for the state and city, both budgeted for larger declines so the impact on projected revenues should be limited.\u201d It should be noted that the comptroller\u2019s numbers only reflect the bonuses paid to securities industry employees working for firms based in New York City. Beyond bringing in tax revenue for government coffers, Wall Street workers contribute substantially to the local Gotham economy. DiNapoli said that more employees in financial services (65%) are working in-office on any given day compared to 58% working in other industries in the city, at least as of September 2023. And that securities industry employees use the subway more than other workers in the city. All in, he estimates that Wall Street is responsible for roughly 14% of economic activity in the city. As critical as that is, the city and state are about much more than just Wall Street. \u201cThe securities industry\u2019s continued strength should not overshadow the broader economic picture in New York, where we need all sectors to enjoy full recovery from the pandemic,\u201d DiNapoli said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/19/success/wall-street-bonuses/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_media_fox-news-trump-conviction", "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s media allies are demanding retribution in the wake of his conviction. Following\u00a0weeks of\u00a0attacks targeting the historic hush money case against the former president, prominent right-wing media figures immediately flooded the public discourse Thursday with extreme and disturbing rhetoric after Trump was found guilty on 34 felony counts. On\u00a0Fox News\u00a0and other right-wing outlets, pro-Trump media personalities erupted in anger, blaming everyone from\u00a0Judge\u00a0Juan Merchan\u00a0and Manhattan District Attorney\u00a0Alvin Bragg\u00a0to\u00a0President Joe Biden\u00a0and the entire U.S. justice system for the \u201cdisgraceful\u201d conviction. While not surprising, the furious bluster reverberating across right-wing media still carried its intended effect, burning away public trust in America\u2019s core institutions and leaving a lasting impact on the legitimacy of the rule of law in the United States. The toxic commentary is also enflaming desires of retribution held by Trump supporters, with popular right-wing media figures openly declaring their hope that the GOP candidate to nakedly seek revenge against his critics, should he emerge victorious in November and return to the Oval Office. Indeed, it is not only that\u00a0MAGA Media\u00a0personalities are assailing the guilty verdict returned by a jury of 12 New Yorkers, calling it unfair and rigged. Some of the right\u2019s most popular talking heads are openly calling for the weaponization of government to seek retribution against Trump\u2019s political opponents. The Daily Wire\u2019s Matt Walsh, who commands a following of millions of subscribers on\u00a0YouTube\u00a0and social media, said after the verdict that Trump \u201cshould make and publish a list of ten high ranking Democrat criminals who he will have arrested when he takes office.\u201d\u00a0The Federalist\u00a0chief executive\u00a0Sean Davis\u00a0said he wants \u201cto see lists of which Democrat officials are going to be put in prison.\u201d And\u00a0Fox News\u2019 Jesse Watters\u00a0declared, \u201cWe\u2019re going to vanquish the evil forces that are destroying this republic.\u201d Suffice to say, that unhinged, reckless, and dangerous rhetoric is not normal. And it even exceeds some of the highly charged rhetoric that played out during Trump\u2019s administration when then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u00a0probed the then-president over his ties to Russia. But as the legal walls\u00a0actually\u00a0begin to close in on Trump, the commentary in right-wing media is getting angrier, more menacing, and taking a markedly darker tone. In the hours after the verdict was handed down Thursday, talk of the United States having transformed into a third-world dictatorship was the\u00a0norm\u00a0in pro-Trump media, with the term \u201cbanana republic\u201d regularly tossed around. In fact, there was little room for disagreement with the radical and warped viewpoint. \u201cImport the Third World, become the Third World. That\u2019s what we just saw,\u201d right-wing extremist\u00a0Tucker Carlson\u00a0declared on\u00a0X. \u201cThis won\u2019t stop Trump. He\u2019ll win the election if he\u2019s not killed first. But it does mark the end of the fairest justice system in the world. Anyone who defends this verdict is a danger to you and your family.\u201d As has become the new normal, Fox News also promoted a parade of dishonest right-wing talking points to its sizable audience.\u00a0Laura Ingraham\u00a0declared that \u201cthe Democrats are showing [the country] what real power is \u2026 the type of power we usually see dictators exercise in China and Cuba and North Korea.\u201d\u00a0Sean Hannity\u00a0complained that \u201cthe foundation of our constitutional republic\u201d is \u201cliterally dying before your eyes.\u201d That rhetoric is, obviously, detached from reality. The United States is not a third world country. Trump got his day in court and was treated by the judge, by all accounts, quite fairly.\u00a0Biden did not direct so-called deep state forces to engage in \u201clawfare\u201d against Trump. But the endless streams of poison flooding into the public discourse comes with consequences. It not only offers a preview of just how ugly the 2024 race will soon become, it sets the stage for Trump, if he manages to make his way back into the White House, to abuse power and deform the federal institutions to serve his purposes. Perversely, it has primed a swath of Americans into believing that such behavior would not only be warranted, but\u00a0necessary.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/media/fox-news-trump-conviction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}

The sales came not long after a October 19, 2022 earning call in which he told investors \u201cI can\u2019t emphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4.\u201d But when Tesla reported fourth-quarter sales, they were far weaker than forecast, and that sent stocks down 12%, the worst day of trading for the stock in more than two years. \u201cMusk profited from his misconduct and his exploitation of material and adverse inside information,\u201d alleged the suit, filed by shareholder Michael Perry. The suit requests that Musk return the profits on the stock sale to the company, as well as attorney fees and other costs to Perry for bringing the suit. Musk likely knew the weaker sales report was coming at the time of the sale, the suit charges. Tesla reduced its prices in China by as much as 9% on October 24, 2022, starting a string of price cuts that has driven down prices of electric vehicles by Tesla and other automakers in the face of weaker-than-forecast sales. And in April of last year, Musk bragged about the up-to-the-minute sales data that Tesla has, compared to automakers that sell their vehicles to a network of independent dealerships rather than directly to customers. \u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s any company on earth that has better real-time data than Tesla, except maybe SpaceX Starlink,\u201d he told investors at that time, referring to one of his other companies. Tesla stock sales funded Twitter purchase Before Musk started his efforts to buy social media platform Twitter, now known as X, the billionaire executive rarely sold Tesla shares. Most of the time, his sales were tied to covering tax bills he faced due to the exercise of stock options. And most of those sales were part of a prearranged schedule, so there could be little question as to whether they were based on insider information. But from April through December in 2022, Musk sold $22.9 billion worth of Tesla stock in unscheduled sales to help fund his $44 billion purchase of Twitter that year. His sales in November and December of 2022, along with the price cuts in China, helped to push down the price of Tesla shares even before the January sales report. His sale on November 4 2022 came at an average price of $208.58, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. His final sales of this group, on December 14, came at an average price that day of $158.37. But the January fourth-quarter sales report, which came on a Sunday, sent shares down to $108.10 from $123.18 at the close the previous Friday. Tesla shares soon rebounded, though, and more than doubled during the course of 2023 to close at $248.48. But shares have struggled this year, losing 29% of their value year to date through Monday\u2019s close. The suit was filed in Delaware Chancery Court on Thursday and first reported by Bloomberg. Tesla, which does not have a public relations department, did not return a request for comment. The lawsuit comes as Tesla is seeking shareholder approval to return the stock options to Musk that he was stripped of in a January court decision in Delaware. Two influential advisory firms have urged shareholders to vote against his controversial billion pay package and raised concerns about the CEO\u2019s numerous side projects.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/business/musk-tesla-stock-sale-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_cars_japan-toyota-raid-safety-scandal-hnk-intl", "text": "Japanese officials descended on the headquarters of Toyota on Tuesday, after a safety test scandal at a number of automakers in the country widened this week. The inspections at Toyota\u2019s offices in central Japan would continue over the next few days, Japan\u2019s Ministry of Transport told CNN. It comes as the world\u2019s biggest carmaker by sales grapples with growing concerns over the certification of some of its vehicles. The ministry said five automakers \u2014 Toyota (TM), Mazda, Honda (HMC), Suzuki and Yamaha \u2014 had submitted incorrect or manipulated safety test data when they applied for certification of the vehicles. Toyota,\u00a0Mazda and Yamaha were ordered to suspend shipments of some vehicle models, including the Corolla Fielder and Corolla Axio. All five companies were told to review their safety certification processes. A probe already undertaken by Toyota had revealed that at least seven of its models, some of them discontinued, were tested using methods that differed from government standards, the company said Monday in a statement. Toyota was looking into \u201cinadequate data in pedestrian and occupant protection tests\u201d and \u201cerrors in crash tests,\u201d it said. The investigation is ongoing. Toyota said it had not violated safety regulations and customers did not need to stop using their cars. Koji Endo of\u00a0SBI Securities said that Japan\u2019s certification tests are very stringent and much stricter than in other countries. \u201cAs for these safety inspection standards, this rule was created in 1951, so it\u2019s quite outdated and hard to follow for many automakers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to remember, Toyota has conducted hundreds of thousands, if not millions of tests throughout the past 15 years. And of those tests, there were only concerns about how three or four of those tests were conducted. That\u2019s very little,\u201d Endo added. Still, because of its position as the world\u2019s top carmaker, the scandal had become \u201ca big problem\u201d for the company, he said. In a press conference Monday, Akio Toyoda, the grandson of Toyota\u2019s founder and company chairman, apologized for the problems. \u201cI intend to extend our efforts throughout the entire group and restore authority on site to create a solid corporate culture that makes ever-better cars,\u201d he said. Operations at Toyota\u2019s factories will not be halted during the probe but production will pause for the three models under investigation, the Transport Ministry said. It said officials would also inspect the facilities of the other four carmakers but did not say when those visits would take place. In January, Toyota\u00a0announced\u00a0it would suspend shipments of certain models after finding irregularities in certification tests for diesel engines developed by its affiliate, Toyota Industries. The revelations came just a month after Daihatsu, the Japanese small carmaker owned by Toyota,\u00a0halted domestic production\u00a0after admitting it had forged the results of safety tests for more than 30 years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/cars/japan-toyota-raid-safety-scandal-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_business_ev-sales-used-car-tesla", "text": "Sales of new electric vehicles have started to slow, but the opposite is happening with used EVs. A combination of factors has led to increases in both the number of used electric vehicles available to purchase and the number of people looking to buy them. The reasons include tax breaks, price drops and a glut of cheap Tesla models caused by Tesla\u2019s own price cuts on its new cars and SUVs. The auto site Cars.com, which carries dealer listings for used and new vehicles, said searches for used EVs on its site have increased 45% since last year. On TrueCar, another site that helps car shoppers find new and used vehicles, interest in EVs was up 39% in the first quarter of this year compared to last year. The used car sales website Carvana saw its used EV sales more than double since last year. One reason is that federal tax credits on used EVs, not just new ones, are finally available,  and they\u2019re hitting at just the right time. The $4,000 federal tax credit for pre-owned EVs can be used by the dealership as a price reduction at the time of the sale, rather than the customer having to wait until they file their taxes to get the money. Not all dealerships are willing to do the paperwork, though. Also, there are limitations on the vehicles that qualify as well as limits on the income of the buyer. One Georgia car dealership executive, who asked to remain anonymous because he wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss sales strategies with the press, said his dealership has seen a huge increase in sales of used EVs since he started advertising that his dealership could apply tax credits at the time of sale, immediately lowering the price by $4,000. \u201cWhat it\u2019s doing, in my opinion, is it\u2019s allowing middle income shoppers that really are interested in EVs, but had always thought they were out of their price range to come into the market, become EV owners, and also achieve a car payment that is sustainable,\u201d the dealer said. Price cuts and supply gluts A surge in the number of used EVs available has also enabled an economically paradoxical situation: even as demand for used EVs is rising, prices are still falling. According to Cars.com, even as searches for used EVs on the site rose 45% since last year, the supply increased 42% and the average price of a used EV on the site has dropped 20%. Truecar reported a similar situation. While increases in used EV sales are huge, they still make up a small portion of overall used vehicle sales. Carvana, for instance, reported that used electric vehicles made up 4.3% of its sales in the first quarter of this year, but that was a big jump from 1.8% last year. \u201cYou have people who\u2019ve been sitting on the sidelines who want an easy, risk-free way to adopt new technology,\u201d said Matt Jones, a spokesperson for TrueCar. \u201cAnd the risk is way reduced when you\u2019re buying something that costs $20,000 versus $80,000.\u201d Manheim, a company owned by Cox Automotive that sells used cars wholesale to auto dealers, has had to upgrade its operations across the country to deal with the influx of used EVs. The company, which operates a number of large auction sites that each process thousands of used cars, sold 60% more EVs last year than in 2022 and expects the number to triple in 2024. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to add chargers, but it\u2019s not just chargers. It\u2019s chargers and then everything in our shops\u2026 were built for [internal combustion] vehicles,\u201d said Grace Huang, President of Cox Automotive Inventory Solutions. \u201cAnd so we\u2019ve had to add lifts that can handle more weight because the batteries are very heavy.\u201d A big part of the drop in used EV prices can be attributed to Tesla, which \u2014 over the past year or so \u2014 has been aggressively cutting prices of its popular Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV. It\u2019s a simple matter of economics that when an automaker cuts the prices of its new products, the prices of similar used products \u2013 in this case, EVs \u2013 drop too. The price of a given used 2021 Tesla Model 3 sedan dropped, on average, about 29% during calendar year 2023, according to data from\u00a0Edmunds.com. That was more than the average model year 2021 used vehicle which would have lost about 19.5% in value over that same period. EVs have always had faster depreciation, or loss in value, than gas cars, though, which works in favor of buying used EVs, said Jones. A good time to buy a used EV? Used EVs still cost more, on average, than used gas-powered vehicles, but they cost a lot less than new EVs. While prices for new EVs average around $63,000, prices for used ones average around $36,000, according to Cars.com. And the price gap between electric and gas powered used cars is shrinking rapidly, according to Carvana. Where there was a $13,000 difference, on average, between gas powered used vehicles and used EVs in the early part of 2023, the difference has shrunk to just $7,000 by the first quarter of 2024. The appeal of what\u2019s available has also increased. EVs have improved over time, so models now hitting the used market now are a lot better than the very early EVs that would have been available as used cars years ago, said Rebecca Lindland, an industry analyst with Cars.com.  \u201cThis is a significant change so that people who may have looked at an EV five years ago, It\u2019s worth a revisit because of the improvements in technology, specifically in range and charging,\u201d she said. Batteries in used EVs are also holding up well, according to Recurrent, a company that tracks EV battery health. The vast majority of used EVs can be expected to go very nearly as far on a charge as they could when they were new. The fastest-selling used EVs on Cars.com right now are the Chevrolet Bolt models, Rivian trucks and SUVs and the Hyundai Ioniq 5, according to Cars.com. Courtney Vaughn just bought a used Hyundai Kona EV on Carvana that will cost her $16,000 after the $4,000 tax credit, she said. She lives in New York but is  having the car delivered in California so it will be waiting for her there when she moves there for a new job. \u201cI\u2019m really excited and there\u2019s only, like, 66,000 miles on it,\u201d she said. Concerns about gas prices and having to deal with California\u2019s smog tests interested her in buying an EV, she said. Besides the federal tax credit, Lindland also recommends people check for local and even municipal tax incentives for new or used electric cars and home EV chargers. Incentives can vary a lot from place to place. \u201cReally look at your immediate neighborhood,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a zip code level search.\u201d A good local car dealer should be able to help you find out about all the incentives that are available, she said. She also recommended looking at the US Department of Energy\u2019s Alternative Fuel\u2019s Data Center, which has a guide listing federal and local EV incentives.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/business/ev-sales-used-car-tesla/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_business_bob-kelley-used-car-kelley-blue-book-dies-96", "text": "If you\u2019re wondering how much your car is worth, or how much to pay for that car you\u2019re thinking of buying, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll check KBB.com. That\u2019s short for Kelley Blue Book, and it\u2019s one of the longest-standing sources for used car values there is. A man who was instrumental in its rise to prominence, Bob Kelley, died on May 28 in Indian Wells, California, at the age of 96. The Blue Book\u2019s origins lie in the Kelley Kar Company of Los Angeles, a used car dealership founded by Bob\u2019s uncle, Les Kelley, in 1918 with a few Model T Fords. Wanting to grow his inventory, Kelley Kar Company circulated a list of cars it wanted to buy and how much it would pay for them. By 1926, that list turned into the first Kelley Blue Book pricing guide for used cars. Long ago, Bob Kelley was a \u201clot boy\u201d at the dealership run by his uncle and his father, Sidney \u201cBuster\u201d Kelley. He did things like filling tires. Eventually, he took charge of fixing up used cars and estimating their resale value, the kind of figures that would go into the paper guide. By the 1960s, that book became the whole business. The family sold the car dealership and sold the pricing guide, separately, to a private investor, said Bob Kelley\u2019s son-in-law Charlie Vogelheim. Buster and Bob Kelley both signed 40-year management contracts to continue running operations, though, he said. For most of the first 30 years as a standalone business, the Blue Book was largely an industry source, not something for the general public to use, according to KBB.com. Car dealers, finance companies and insurance companies relied on its values and the book helped shape how people thought about what cars are worth. Kelley Blue Book claims to be the first to show the effect of mileage on a used vehicle\u2019s value, for example. Other related products were added over the years, including a new car pricing guide in 1966, RV and motorcycle guides and even a \u201cManufactured Housing\u201d price guide. In 1995, Kelley Blue Book started a website, making its data easily accessible to the general public, not just industry insiders. Still, the book continued in publication every two months for several more years, said Vogelheim, because not everyone was using the internet. \u201cThe nice thing about the new technology is you could get fresh values distributed more frequently and more specific in terms of your information,\u201d he said, \u201cbut, you know, the book, if you dropped it, it\u2019d still work. You didn\u2019t have to plug it in and recharge or anything like that.\u201d Bob retired from the company in 2000. Vogelheim worked with him at Kelley Blue Book starting in 1985 and was there when Kelley retired. \u201cBob was my mentor, going through all of the vehicle values, relationships between the different vehicles and, of course, the whole operation of publishing the book,\u201d Vogelheim said. \u201cBefore the computer, we did it internally, the whole set up and delivery of the proof sheets and then the actual printing and distribution.\u201d The last step in the production process was rounding off the corners of the small book so dealers could easily slip it into a shirt pocket, he said. Bob Kelley also taught people to pay attention to what customers actually valued and would pay for in their cars, which was more complicated than just subtracting a certain amount from the price of the new car. For instance, some early 1990s Lexus cars came with a phone installed as an expensive option, said Vogelheim, but, when the cars were sold as used, the clunky corded phone actually reduced the car\u2019s value. \u201cIt was in the way,\u201d he said. Kelley Blue Book and its website, KBB.com, were purchased by the auto sales website Autotrader in 2010, becoming part of the privately owned conglomerate Cox Enterprises. There were, and are, competitors to Kelley Blue Book, of course. A company called Edmunds started its own consumer-focused pricing guide in 1966, and it also went online in 1995 as another source of automotive pricing information. But Kelley Blue Book was one of the very earliest to create a standard way for shoppers and the industry to gauge the value of a used car.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/business/bob-kelley-used-car-kelley-blue-book-dies-96/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_media_nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel", "text": "NBC News on Tuesday ousted former Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, just days after her hiring as a paid political analyst sparked intense backlash from the network\u2019s top television anchors over McDaniel\u2019s role in subverting the 2020 election and attacks on the press. \u201cThere is no doubt that the last several days have been difficult for the News Group,\u201d NBCUniversal News Group President Cesar Conde said in a memo to staff. \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor.\u201d \u201cI want to personally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down,\u201d Conde continued. \u201cWhile this was a collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team, I approved it and take full responsibility for it.\u201d Ahead of the network\u2019s decision, McDaniel spent the day Tuesday interviewing attorneys in preparation for a potential legal battle with NBC, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency that brokered McDaniel\u2019s deal with NBC, also parted ways with her, the person said. The reversal comes after journalists and anchors at both NBC and its cable news sibling MSNBC publicly denounced the decision to hire McDaniel as a paid analyst in a stunning and unprecedented on-air rebuke of network brass that has embarrassed the Peacock Network. McDaniel, who recently stepped down from the RNC under pressure from former President Donald Trump, was involved in attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As head of the RNC, she was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d In the years since, McDaniel continued to claim that the election had \u201cproblems\u201d and that Biden did not legitimately win the election, fanning the flames of election denialism. NBC\u2019s announcement Friday that it had hired McDaniel was quickly met with alarm by the network\u2019s journalists. The revolt spilled into public view on Sunday when McDaniel appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with moderator Kristen Welker in her first interview since she was hired by the network. Welker disclosed that the interview had been scheduled to take place prior to NBC announcing McDaniel would become a paid contributor for the network, stating that she had no involvement in her hiring. Following the interview, Chuck Todd, NBC News\u2019 chief political analyst, delivered a stinging on-air criticism of NBC executives for their decision to hire McDaniel, telling Welker, \u201cI think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason a lot of journalists at NBC News are uncomfortable with this,\u201d Todd said, explaining that under McDaniel, the RNC engaged in \u201cgaslighting\u201d and \u201ccharacter assassination\u201d when dealing with the news media. The following day, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough joined Todd in protesting the decision on their program \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, we believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices to provide balance in their election coverage, but it should be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier,\u201d\u00a0Brzezinski said. \u201cWe hope NBC will reconsider its decision. It goes without saying that she will not be a guest on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 in her capacity as a paid contributor.\u201d Nicolle Wallace, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDeadline: White House,\u201d later joined in the rebuke, saying on her program that the network\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel was nothing short of a potential threat to democracy. \u201cNBC News is, either wittingly or unwittingly, teaching election deniers that what they can do stretches well beyond appearing on our air and interviews to peddle lies about the sanctity and integrity of our elections,\u201d Wallace told viewers. Rachel Maddow \u2014 the network\u2019s biggest star \u2014 later devoted the first half-hour of her prime-time program to the controversy, saying the decision to hire McDaniel was \u201cinexplicable.\u201d Maddow took issue with McDaniel\u2019s long track record of demonizing the news media, labeling the press as \u201cfake news,\u201d and launching ugly attacks on NBC News journalists and MSNBC hosts. \u201cWe do not take it personally when we get attacked, when they say they want to put us on trial and execute us for treason,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I want to associate myself with all my colleagues at MSNBC and NBC News who have voiced loud and principled objections to our company for putting on the payroll someone who hasn\u2019t just attacked us as journalists, but someone who is part of an ongoing project to get rid of our system of government,\u201d she said of McDaniel. \u201cSomeone who is still trying to convince Americans that this election stuff doesn\u2019t really work. That this last election wasn\u2019t a real result. That American elections are fraudulent.\u201c The on-air revolt ensnared NBC\u2019s top leaders, including NBCUniversal News Group chair Cesar Conde, NBC News president Rebecca Blumenstein and senior vice president of politics Carrie Budoff Brown, who were responsible for McDaniel\u2019s hiring. MSNBC president Rashida Jones also did not object to the decision, people familiar with the matter said. In the wake of Conde\u2019s announcement to sever ties with McDaniel, MSNBC host Joy Reid and Maddow addressed the reversal on the network\u2019s air, praising the move as \u201cbold\u201d and \u201cstrong.\u201d \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/media/nbc-news-ousts-ronna-mcdaniel/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_economy_job-openings-quits-jolts-april", "text": "The number of job openings in the US shrank for the second month in a row, setting a new three-year low amid further signals of cooling in the labor market. There were 8.06 million available jobs posted in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report released Tuesday. That\u2019s below the downwardly revised 8.36 million seen a month before and the lowest since February 2021. Economists were expecting job openings to register 8.36 million, according to FactSet estimates. As of April, there were an estimated 1.2 available jobs for every job seeker. That\u2019s the lowest ratio since June 2021, BLS data shows. The job market has been historically strong during the past couple of years, providing a firm foundation for hearty consumer spending that has propelled the economy forward despite dueling pressures of elevated inflation and high interest rates. Layoffs remain low In addition to the decline in job openings, other measures of labor turnover showed minimal movement in April. The quits rate, which measures voluntary separations as a percentage of total employment, held steady at 2.2% for the sixth consecutive month. The number of new hires moved up slightly to 5.64 million from 5.62 million; total quits inched higher to 3.51 million from 3.41 million; and layoffs dropped to 1.52 million from 1.6 million in March. Layoffs are at their lowest level since December 2022. \u201cThe decline\u00a0in openings points to a slower pace of hiring in the months ahead. However, layoffs remain low, so net job growth should continue to be positive,\u201d Nancy Vanden Houten, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note issued Tuesday. Job growth has indeed slowed from its breakneck pace during the pandemic recovery. That cooling was apparent in April, when there were only 175,000 jobs added, according to initial BLS estimates. What the latest jobs data means for the Fed A slowing of job growth could put the labor market on closer footing to pre-pandemic levels, but it also could mean a slowing in the broader economy. The Federal Reserve, in its battle against high inflation, is wanting to see demand soften and price hikes slow even further before cutting rates. The Consumer Price Index, the most widely used inflation gauge, showed that the pace of price hikes slowed to 3.4% in April. \u201cThe Federal Reserve will welcome signs of cooler labor market conditions, but the JOLTS data don\u2019t change our view that the Fed will be content to keep interest rates at current levels until September,\u201d Vanden Houten wrote. \u201cThe labor market remains healthy enough to allow Fed policy decisions to be primarily guided by readings on inflation.\u201d The April inflation data was encouraging, she said; however, the Fed \u201cneeds to see more than one month of good data before lowering interest rates.\u201d Still, openings remain above pre-pandemic levels \u2014 about 1.09 million higher than in February 2020 and 3.55 million higher than the average from December 2000 to February 2019 \u2014 but there are plenty of caveats that come into play with JOLTS. First, the survey response rates are half what they were 10 years ago (33% in 2024 versus 68% in 2014), although they have picked up somewhat after bottoming out during the pandemic. Second, the labor market is a different animal than it was 10 or 20 years ago. Labor force participation rates have been on the decline since the turn of the century due to demographic shifts (largely, aging Baby Boomers) and certainly due to pandemic effects (early retirements, deaths, long Covid and caregiving needs).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/economy/job-openings-quits-jolts-april/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}

According to CEO and founder Rob Sims, digital humans can help bridge the gap between AI technology and people. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is when people start working with and conversing with a digital human, they very quickly suspend disbelief,\u201d Sims tells CNN. \u201cIt becomes natural.\u201d AI explosion Since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, considerable hype has surrounded the potential of generative AI \u2014 artificial intelligence powered by huge datasets of information, capable of generating text outputs in a conversational way. Record levels of investment into generative AI have followed, with over $21 billion poured into the industry during the first nine months of last year, according to data insights company Pitchbook. In March 2023, Google launched Bard (recently renamed Gemini) and around the same time Anthropic released its AI assistant Claude. As generative AI chatbots become increasingly ubiquitous, Sum Vivas is one of several companies looking to make them more human.

However, there are widespread concerns about the impact AI could have on the job market.  \u201cWhen we rely on automated tools, what skills are we losing in the process?\u201d asks Jennifer Ding, senior researcher at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK\u2019s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence. \u201cIn some ways, we think of AI as something that\u2019s helping us or augmenting our work,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, alongside, this fear of replacement is bubbling up more and more.\u201d Harris, however, points to new opportunities within digital human design and development. \u201cEvery scenario that we found, we\u2019re creating jobs and working in harmony with people rather than taking away jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cDigital humans, first and foremost, should work with other human colleagues,\u201d adds Sims. \u201cWe\u2019ll move into a stage where digital humans will start to become just another member of the team, with added benefits for that team, and obviously the customers they serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/business/digital-humans-ai-dj-dex-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_27_media_nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over", "text": "Only 80 hours elapsed between NBC News announcing Ronna McDaniel as a paid contributor and the network ousting her from that very role. But for the leadership at NBC Universal News Group, those were 80\u00a0painful hours. On Tuesday evening, following another full day in which the media rumor mill churned at warp speed, NBCU News Group boss Cesar Conde sent staff a memo, notifying his troops that he had reversed his decision to welcome the former Republican National Committee chair to \u201cthe team.\u201d \u201cAfter listening to the legitimate concerns of many of you, I have decided that Ronna McDaniel will not be an NBC News contributor,\u201d Conde said, adding that he wanted to \u201cpersonally apologize to our team members who felt we let them down.\u201d Conde had no real choice. The embattled NBCU boss, who I\u2019m told dealt with the crisis from an unknown location outside of 30 Rock, was facing an unprecedented rebellion from his most high-profile stars, who one by one went on the air and excoriated leadership\u2019s decision to hire McDaniel. The only aspect of Conde\u2019s note that was surprising was the fact that it came 48 hours late, allowing what started off as a crisis to fester and balloon into one of the worst corporate public relations calamities in recent memory. \u201cWhat a sh*t show!\u201d a media executive exclaimed to me Tuesday shortly after Conde relieved McDaniel of her NBC News credentials. In his note, Conde said he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for McDaniel\u2019s hire. But, he also did point the finger, telling staffers that hiring her was \u201ca collective recommendation by some members of our leadership team.\u201d Indeed, multiple people familiar with the matter have told me that the infighting among NBC executives over who was at fault for the disaster has reached a fever pitch, with various factions of the NBCU News Group assigning blame to others. Regardless of who is to blame, the entire affair made clear who is actually in control of the company \u2014 and it\u2019s not Conde & Co. Despite the NBCU C-suite digging their heels in the sand as they resisted dumping McDaniel for days, they were ultimately forced to succumb to pressure from their talent. As a second media executive commented to me, it is now \u201cvery clear who is in charge\u201d after the \u201cweak leadership was put on full display.\u201d \u201cHas Cesar lost the room?\u201d wondered a third media executive. While the Peacock family argues over who was really at fault, the company is facing a fresh public relations mess. Led by Donald Trump, right-wing personalities are already assailing the network as being overrun with intolerant woke leftists. \u201cThese Radical Left Lunatics are CRAZY and the top people at NBC ARE WEAK,\u201d Trump raged on his Truth Social platform. Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote on X: \u201cWhat NBC is saying is if you\u2019re for Trump, you don\u2019t belong. Good. Let NBC be for Democrats only.\u201d Of course, that narrative is intellectually dishonest. The objection to McDaniel from both within and outside of NBCU was not that she is a Republican. It wasn\u2019t even that she was a Trump-supporting Republican. No, the objection stemmed from the fact that McDaniel was an active participant in the plot to subvert the 2020 vote. And, in addition to that disgraceful history, she had a lengthy track record smearing NBC News and MSNBC. Nevertheless, NBCU will now have to contend with such dishonest attacks being leveled by the right, which will follow them in the days, months, and even years to come. As unfair as it may be, they will certainly damage the network\u2019s brand in Republican circles \u2014 a place it had gone through great pains to appeal to. NBCU will also have to grapple with McDaniel, who spent the last 24 hours or so interviewing lawyers as she gears up for a possible legal fight with the network, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rift between McDaniel and NBCU had grown to such an extent by Tuesday that she was not informed by network brass that she had been dismissed, I\u2019m told. Instead, McDaniel learned of her ouster in press reports. While NBCU is being beaten up on the right, the company\u2019s leadership was quickly praised by its journalists and top stars. Shortly after Conde sent out his memo, Rachel Maddow appeared on Joy Reid\u2019s show, where the two lauded Conde for reversing course. \u201cI think it is a show of strength and a show of respect for the people who work at this company and make us who we are,\u201d Maddow said. \u201cThat leadership was willing to change on this, I\u2019m grateful to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/27/media/nbc-ronna-mcdaniel-problems-are-not-over/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_economy_general-election-issue-uk-economy", "text": "When UK voters elect a new government on July 4, the health of the world\u2019s sixth-biggest economy will likely be the main factor in deciding the outcome. The Conservative Party of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has been in office since 2010, a period that has included the twin shocks of a pandemic and war in Ukraine. But the United Kingdom has also been held back by two self-inflicted wounds \u2014 deep austerity in the wake of the global financial crisis and the 2016 decision to quit the European Union, which raised new barriers to trade. Economic growth has been anemic in recent years, squeezing living standards and starving public services of funds. Sunak and Keir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, face off in their first televised debate late Tuesday. The stakes are high. Opinion polls suggest the Conservatives are set to be booted from office, with Labour on course to win a UK election for the first time since Tony Blair took the party to victory in 2005.  Sunak will likely point to falling inflation and a strengthening economy as proof that his plan to \u201crestore economic stability\u201d is working. But many households are still experiencing a cost-of-living crisis and are struggling to pay their bills. And the state of the overburdened National Health Service comes in a close second among the biggest issues for the electorate, according to polling by YouGov. When they cast their ballots, voters will consider whether their lives have materially improved since 2010, when the Conservatives came to power. Here\u2019s what data shows has happened to wages, living standards, the value of the pound, house prices and waiting times for medical treatment on the NHS. Incomes have barely risen Inflation, which hit a record 11.1% just 18 months ago, has eaten into households\u2019 spending power. Although the annual pace of price rises has slowed \u2014 and wages have now grown faster than inflation for nine months in a row \u2014 real, or inflation-adjusted, pay has barely increased since 2010, which means people aren\u2019t substantially better-off. \u201cPoor income growth has been an unfortunate feature of economic life in the UK over the last 15 years. And it has been slow growth for essentially everyone: rich and poor, old and young,\u201d Tom Waters, an associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an economics research institute, said in a statement Friday. \u201cIn the long run, what is needed is rises in productivity,\u201d he added. The Resolution Foundation makes the same diagnosis. The think tank has estimated that real average weekly earnings last year were \u00a3205 ($262) below the level they would have been had they carried on growing at the same pace as before the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cWeak productivity growth has delivered an unprecedented stagnation in real wages, even before the highest inflation in four decades hit,\u201d it said in a report published in December. Living standards have disappointed Feeble growth in productivity \u2014 often measured as gross domestic product per hour worked \u2014 has hamstrung many advanced economies since at least the global financial crisis. But the United Kingdom has fared worse than many peers, resulting in a bigger hit to incomes and also hurting living standards. \u201cThe period between 2010 and 2024 has been economically remarkable,\u201d Nick Ridpath, research economist at the IFS, said in a statement Monday, citing slow earnings growth and steep public spending cuts, among other things. \u201cAt the heart of it all was a period of abysmal growth in productivity and, with it, living standards.\u201d According to the IFS, in the 12 years before 2007, the average income of Britain\u2019s working age population rose more than 40% \u2014 more than three times the growth in the United States and seven times that in Germany. By contrast, between 2007 and 2019, the typical UK income increased just 6% \u2014 half the level of the United States and almost three times less than in Germany. The pound is 14% weaker The UK currency has also taken a beating over the past 14 years \u2014 not helped by the Brexit referendum in June 2016 or the disastrous \u201cmini\u201d budget unveiled by former Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss in September 2022. Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union has haunted the pound and inward investment into the country for almost a decade. A weaker currency exacerbates inflation \u2014 which peaked at a higher level in Britain than it did in the United States and the eurozone \u2014 because it raises the cost of imported goods. \u201cBrexit led to a large and long-lasting increase in uncertainty, which analysis shows reduced investment, which will have reduced output and productivity,\u201d Clare Lombardelli, the incoming deputy governor for monetary policy at the Bank of England, said in a recent questionnaire published on the central bank\u2019s website. \u201cThe data also shows that Brexit has had a negative effect on trade, which will also weigh on productivity,\u201d she added. Home ownership is in decline While real wages have hardly grown, house prices have soared, pushing the dream of home ownership out of reach for many Brits. From a peak of \u00a3291,716 ($373,236) in September 2022 the average house price fell to \u00a3284,691 ($364,242) last December, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). But prices remain high by historic standards, particularly when compared with incomes. With affordability stretched, home ownership rates have fallen. In 2021, 62% of households in England owned their home, census data showed. That\u2019s down from 68% in 2008/2009, according to official figures, shortly before the Conservatives came to power.  Millions of Brits are stuck in rental properties, which have also become more expensive. On average, households now spend more than 29% of their after-tax income on rent, up from 24% in 2010, according to Zoopla, a property company. The NHS is overstretched One of Sunak\u2019s five promises to voters early on in his premiership was to cut NHS waiting lists. But the number of patients waiting for non-emergency treatment in England has climbed from 6.1 million in January 2023, when he made that pledge, to around 6.3 million in March this year. The treatment spans diagnostic tests and scans, procedures such as hip and knee replacements, as well as non-urgent cardiac surgery, cancer treatment and neurosurgery. Since some patients require multiple treatments, the number of outstanding appointments stood at 7.5 million in March, according to NHS England. NHS waiting lists have grown steadily since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, contributing to worker shortages in the UK. According to the ONS, ill health was the reason why more than 2.8 million people were \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d between January and March 2024. An ONS survey in February 2023 found that a third of the economically inactive were waiting for NHS treatment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/economy/general-election-issue-uk-economy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_investing_india-elections-stock-market-hnk-intl", "text": "Indian stocks plunged Tuesday as vote counting in the country\u2019s election suggested Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s dream of a landslide victory is at risk, raising doubts about his ability to push through more aggressive economic reforms. India\u2019s benchmark Sensex index, which tracks 30 large companies, and the broader Nifty 50 index each closed down by nearly 6%. The worst daily drop for Indian stocks since 2020 came just 24 hours after both indexes\u00a0hit record highs as weekend exit polls prompted experts to predict a resounding victory for Modi. The world\u2019s biggest election concluded on Saturday. The 73-year-old ran on his\u00a0economic record\u00a0over the past 10 years, a period of robust growth for India. His Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was aiming to win a 400-seat\u00a0supermajority\u00a0in the 543-seat lower house of parliament, but preliminary results show the opposition Congress party is performing\u00a0better than some analysts expected. A party or a coalition needs 272 seats to form a government. In India\u2019s last election in 2019, the BJP won 303 seats. If the final results confirm that Modi has underperformed in the polls, key economic reforms may be put on the back burner. \u201cThe (early) election results are showing a less than halfway mark (272 seats) for the current BJP government, pointing towards a coalition government,\u201d said Yashovardhan Khemka, Senior Manager, Research & Analytics at Mumbai-based asset management firm Abans Holdings. \u201cThis will lead to dependence on allies in making key policy decision\u2026 which will lead to policy paralysis and uncertainty in the government\u2019s functioning,\u201d he added. India is the world\u2019s fastest growing major economy and is comfortably placed to expand at an annual rate of at least 6% in the coming few years, but analysts say it needs to achieve growth of\u00a08% or more\u00a0if it wants to become an economic superpower. Sustained expansion would push India higher up the ranks of the world\u2019s biggest economies, with some observers forecasting the country to become number three behind only the United States and China by 2027. The country\u2019s stock markets have performed well during Modi\u2019s tenure. Earlier this year, the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) overtook both the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Exchange to become the world\u2019s sixth largest bourse, data from the World Federation of Exchanges showed. But investors have complained about the high price of Indian stocks and some analysts believe a correction could be healthy for markets. According to Manish Jain, head of institutional business at Mirae Asset Capital Markets, if \u201cvaluations get more reasonable from here on,\u201d it would attract more investments to the world\u2019s fastest growing major economy, as \u201cIndia is a long term structural growth story.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/investing/india-elections-stock-market-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_26_tech_apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit", "text": "When Apple launched its first Mac computer in 1984, with its iconic Mac smiley-face \u201chello\u201d greeting, it wanted to differentiate itself in the fledgling PC market. The Mac was approachable with its friendly, innovative design \u2013 Apple\u2019s way of setting the Mac apart in the confusing PC landscape. That consumer-friendly mantra still exists today, with Apple carefully curating an easy-breezy yet controlled user experience across its products, including the billions of iPhones used around the world. But the Biden administration believes Apple took that too far. On Thursday, the Department of Justice sued Apple for illegally monopolizing the smartphone market. In a press conference, the government provided a long list of how Apple has allegedly squashed competition with restrictive app store terms, high fees and its \u201cwalled-garden\u201d approach, restricting how third-party companies interact with its brands and services. The company denied the lawsuit\u2019s allegations and said it plans to fight them. Apple added that the lawsuit could empower the government \u201cto take a heavy hand in designing people\u2019s technology.\u201d But if successful, the lawsuit could ripple across Apple\u2019s products and services. Although the suit could take years to play out, here\u2019s a closer look what it may eventually mean for iPhone users: Changes to the App Store If found liable, the company could be forced to change a number of things. One such change is how iPhone users could get greater access to \u201csuper apps\u201d that have been largely restricted before. The term refers to one-stop-shop apps that allow for messaging, ordering food, payment processing and other capabilities all within one platform.  According to Dipanjan Chatterjee, a principal analyst at market research firm Forrester, super apps most threaten Apple\u2019s preeminence in the lives of its customers. \u201cAn offering like WeChat, dubbed China\u2019s everything app, can provide an alternative to the Apple ecosystem for people to communicate, bank, share memories, talk to businesses and more,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWhat Apple fears most is becoming irrelevant to its customers.\u201d At the same time, super apps like WeChat are created by larger companies and could, therefore, put some smaller companies at a disadvantage. And the concept hasn\u2019t been welcomed much in the US anyway. The US government, however, could argue that lack of interest may be due to Apple\u2019s high share of the smartphone market and its resistance to offer super apps in its store, Chatterjee said. Better interoperability Apple may also be required to offer more support for cross-platform messaging, an issue the company previously said it\u2019s already working on. The company lets iPhone users send high-quality photos and videos to one another, but similar texts to Android phones are slower and grainy. It also maintains those messages in green bubbles, creating a kind of class divide, critics argue. In November, the company said it will add new features, such as read receipts, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms to help close the gap. Apple\u2019s move to add support for the standard called RCS (rich communication services) is intended to roll out later this year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data. The change followed pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union\u2019s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. The US government could require the same. More open services Another likely change is how hardware from other companies, such as smartwatches, will interact with the Apple range of devices and software, including the iPhone and Apple\u2019s services like Fitness+. The company has also required Apple Watch users to own iOS devices as a way to keep them locked into its existing ecosystem. Chatterjee said making this change would have both positives and negatives. \u201cThe net result would reside somewhere along the spectrum of access to more and cheaper options but also the devaluation of the customer experience that is so highly prized by Apple\u2019s customers,\u201d he said. The Biden administration has also taken issue with Apple\u2019s lack of support for mobile cloud services. Loosening this could allow users to access games and other cloud-based apps without having to pay for pricey hardware. Inside the debate The DOJ lawsuit claims Apple\u2019s behavior has illegally hindered competition, kept its customers locked into its products and prevented other companies from innovating. Although the Biden administration will have to prove these harms, some critics say any potential changes Apple could make will negatively impact the user experience. David McQueen, a research director at ABI Research, said he recognizes that the content and applications market should be open, and Apple needs to avoid monopolistic advantages that can restrict competition, push up prices or block innovation. But Apple\u2019s success stems in part to its tight grip on its products and services, keeping things intuitive and seamless. \u201cIf Apple is forced to comply, it could potentially spell the end to the provision of this consistent and unified user experience, although by the same token, consumers will be open to a greater choice of apps and services, helping more developers and providers,\u201d McQueen said. Chatterjee noted some people are drawn to the Apple family of products precisely because of the carefully managed ecosystem\u2019s ease of use. Apple may have to work that much harder to preserve the integrity of its experience, but any changes probably won\u2019t be enough to make customers to leave and go elsewhere. \u201cThe vast majority of Apple customers would probably be happier with some more choice and lower prices as long as it did not hamper their levels of customer experience, which is threatened by the less control Apple has over the experience,\u201d Chatterjee said. But he added those currently outside of the Apple ecosystem will likely benefit by \u201cplugging in opportunistically without having to go all in with Apple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/apples-iphone-changes-lawsuit/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}

Mondelez\u2019s plant in Trostyanets is now fully\u00a0rebuilt\u00a0after opening partially last year to make chocolates, according to a company statement. The company said the\u00a0Oreo\u00a0cookies and other chocolates produced at the Ukrainian factory are not being exported to neighboring Russia. Mondelez has three factories in Russia and sells its cookies and snacks there despite\u00a0boycotts\u00a0and calls for it to stop from\u00a0employees, activists and investors. Mondelez said it was making its business in Russia\u00a0\u201cstand-alone\u201d\u00a0with a self-sufficient supply chain by the end of 2023. It appointed\u00a0new leadership\u00a0in Europe including Russia earlier this year.

On Monday, District Judge Charles Breyer dismissed and excoriated a lawsuit by X against online watchdog group Center for Countering Digital Hate as an attempt to silence the non-profit group for sounding alarms about hate speech on the platform. Breyer wrote in Monday\u2019s order that the lawsuit was \u201cunabashedly\u201d about \u201cpunishing\u201d reports written by CCDH, which X had accused of campaigning to drive away its advertisers. Breyer held that the reports were \u201cunquestionably\u201d protected by the group\u2019s free speech rights. Now, that decision could embolden other research groups and Musk critics who have faced legal threats from the billionaire. The CCDH case \u2014 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California \u2014\u00a0has been widely viewed as a bellwether for research and accountability on X, where Musk has restored the accounts of previously banned White supremacists and spreaders of misinformation and where Musk himself has amplified various conspiracy theories. And CCDH is not the only organization that has faced attacks by self-proclaimed \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d Musk after criticizing or raising concerns about his platform. \u201cThis is an important decision that sees Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit for what it is \u2014 an effort to punish his critics for constitutionally protected speech and to deter researchers from studying his platform,\u201d said Alex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case arguing that private companies should not be allowed to use breach of contract claims to punish criticism. \u201cSociety needs reliable and ethical research into social media platforms, and often that research relies on being able to study publicly available posts,\u201d Abdo said. X said it plans to appeal Breyer\u2019s decision. Musk\u2019s threats against X critics In his first year as owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk threatened legal action against the Anti-Defamation League for defamation, as well as against Microsoft and Meta for allegedly improper data and trade secret access, respectively. None of those threats ever amounted to real lawsuits. He did, however, sue the progressive media watchdog Media Matters over its\u00a0analysis\u00a0highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X, alleging that the group\u2019s testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the report was designed to drive away advertisers. Legal experts have described that case as \u201cweak\u201d on the merits and as a \u201cbogus\u201d attempt to chill criticism of X. This week\u2019s court decision may be only a temporary setback in Musk\u2019s wider plan to stifle criticism, said Media Matters CEO Angelo Carusone. Musk\u2019s new playbook, Carusone said, enlists the help of sympathetic Republican attorneys general to investigate independent reporting organizations and tie them up in legal proceedings. The states of Texas and Missouri each announced probes into Media Matters following X\u2019s lawsuit against the group, to which Musk responded, \u201cGreat!\u201d As recently as Monday, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a petition in state court seeking to compel Media Matters\u2019 cooperation with his investigation. The filing came a week after he appeared with Musk in a live event on X \u2014 which Carusone said shows how Musk hopes to deputize the power of government to silence his critics. \u201cThey have every reason to do it,\u201d Carusone said of the AGs\u2019 investigations. \u201cThey get the political benefits, they get the attention. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any cost to them yet. And if they are successful at developing this new playbook, this new terrain, legally, then it\u2019s going to pave the way for them to just use this tool and tactic over and over and over again.\u201d A representative for X did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Carusone\u2019s claims. Researchers face hurdles to studying on-platform behavior Researchers from non-profits and academic institutions have had a harder time studying X since Musk\u2019s takeover in 2022. Academics need large samples of posts, shares, likes and other data to study social media trends in mis- and disinformation, public health, elections and other key topics. But one of Musk\u2019s first changes at X was to put access to platform data behind a steep paywall. Researchers and civil society groups said the new subscription fees \u2014 costing up to $2.5 million a year \u2014\u00a0were \u201coutrageously expensive\u201d and made it impossible to do their work, reducing transparency of a critical platform. The change may have forced some researchers to rely more heavily on first-person observational data to draw conclusions about user behavior on X. Groups like CCDH have also used automated \u201cscraping\u201d of publicly viewable content from X rather than paying the company for data directly, a tactic that helped give rise to X\u2019s initial lawsuit. Efforts by X and other social media companies to limit research transparency makes them less accountable to the public at best and, at worst, could mask malicious behavior, said David Karpf, an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. \u201cWe need independent research to have any real measure of what\u2019s going on at X/Twitter. Musk is only ever going to release data that makes his company look good,\u201d Karpf said. \u201cThese platforms are too big and too vital to the spread of information to be left unmonitored.\u201d \u201cThis is an election year,\u201d Karpf added, \u201cand the platforms are taking steps to make it harder to monitor how their services are used for malignant ends.\u201d Free Press, another media accountability organization that has been critical of Musk\u2019s leadership of X and which called for advertisers to pause their spending on the platform shortly after his takeover, also celebrated Breyer\u2019s ruling as potentially removing at least one hurdle that watchdog organizations face. \u201cThe guardrails for democracy are hanging by a thread and we have dwindling insights into platform practices as researchers face lawsuits, congressional subpoenas and other scare tactics,\u201d said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital rights at Free Press. Ultimately, Benavidez called the ruling \u201ca reminder that platform accountability is essential and will inevitably prevail when up against bullies like Musk who try to silence us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/26/tech/judges-stern-rebuke-of-elon-musks-x-gives-researchers-fresh-hope/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_tech_vision-pro-ai-apple", "text": "Apple\u2019s Vision Pro mixed reality headset was announced one year ago this week, and it\u2019s arguably already due for a major upgrade to add artificial intelligence. Apple is expected to announce its first batch of generative AI tools for the iPhone and iPad next week, as part of a greater effort to breathe new life into its struggling product lines. Although the Vision Pro mixed reality headset has only been on the market for a few months, some experts believe the same technology could soon find its way onto the device. Generative AI, the buzzy form of artificial intelligence that can provide thoughtful and thorough responses to questions and prompts, could potentially propel the headset into another level of personalization and immersion, and usher in new use cases for businesses, particularly in the education and medical space. It could also boost sales of the pricey Vision Pro, which has reportedly and unexpectedly received a production cut. At its annual Worldwide Developers Conference at its Cupertino, California, headquarters, which kicks off Monday June 10, CEO Tim Cook will likely lay out the company\u2019s vision for this type of AI. It\u2019s also expected to partner with ChatGPT maker OpenAI to unlock new layers of interaction across its product lines. All this comes during a time when the company is under pressure to catch up to rivals such as Google and Samsung, which are already using the technology in its smartphones. The easy way in The most obvious way to integrate generative AI into the Vision Pro would be through a virtual assistant similar to a much smarter Siri, allowing users to ask questions about what they\u2019re watching or automating tasks such as sending texts by voice or turning on the lights. Other use cases include real-time language translation, deeper collaboration in a workspace environment or personalized fitness plans and guided meditations, according to experts. But the experience could be even richer for businesses. During its most recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought an Apple Vision Pro. \u201c \u2026 [We] are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren\u2019t possible before\u201d, before moving on to other topics,\u201d he added. Tuong Nygugen, a director analyst at market research firm Gartner, said any company which is interested in this market \u201chas to be thinking about it.\u201d \u201cNobody really knows what\u2019s a winner yet, so they\u2019re pulling together all these use cases right now, with a focus on enterprise, and making a case for why this is the future of experiences and devices,\u201d he said. But while it\u2019s unclear when generative AI will come to the Vision Pro, Nygugen said: \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time.\u201d That\u2019s because the Vision Pro is merely just another interface \u2013 much like a tablet, laptop, or watch, that touches Apple\u2019s ecosystem. \u201cThe leg up isn\u2019t in if Apple uses it \u2013 because I would expect everyone to use it \u2013 or even if they use it first,\u201d Nygugen said. \u201cIt\u2019s about how they use it and how they bring value to the user.\u201d The future of Vision Pro Apple\u2019s first new product in seven years entered the market in February just as the extended reality (XR) market \u2014 a category that includes augmented, virtual and mixed reality \u2014 plateaued with little mainstream consumer adoption. The $3,499 headset had limited apps out of the gate and is tethered to a battery pack the size of an iPhone, offering about 2.5 hours of battery life on a single charge. But both consumers and businesses widely agreed the user experience was unmatched when it comes to watching immersive videos and interacting with the world around you. Apple has yet to release specific sales data on the device but Apple analyst Ming Chi-Kuo said production was being cut to as low as 400,000 units per year, compared to early industry projections of 700,000. Adding generative AI to the experience, however, could help developers of all skill levels create more engaging content to attract a greater audience, according to Jeremy Bailenson, founding director of Stanford University\u2019s Virtual Human Interaction Lab. \u201cAlthough most headsets today are cheaper than smartphones and laptops, there is very limited use by consumers due in part to a lack of compelling content that is designed specifically for headsets like the Vision Pro or the Meta Quest,\u201d he said. \u201cAI will help by allowing people without any programming experience to generate 3D models, immersive scenes, and even avatar bodies and animations.\u201d In the lab at Stanford, researchers are already using new software which allows a user to describe any scene by speaking out loud, such as \u201cmake me a beautiful park in the middle of a big city with cows roaming through it.\u201d The VR results emerge in seconds. He sees strong use cases around this particularly in education and gaming. \u201cAI allows teachers to quickly create VR content that fits into their curricula and lesson plans, solving the biggest roadblock of VR in classrooms,\u201d he said. \u201cVR now makes a teacher\u2019s job easier to create lessons, whereas before generative AI, the content creation was so expensive and difficult it often made their jobs harder.\u201d Generative AI could also change gaming on headsets. Social VR \u2013 a concept where users gather together to talk, collaborate and play \u2013 tends to be lonely, Bailenson said. Although there are thousands of virtual scenes on a typical platform, there are far fewer users. \u201cGenerative AI can add non-player characters to make places feel less empty,\u201d he said. Ramon Llamas, a director at market research firm IDC, believes Apple will start with the commercialization of gen AI with Vision Pro, but the bigger impact will ultimately impact businesses. Practical business applications For example, he said a field service worker could troubleshoot machinery in real time with the help of the headset and generative AI. In theory, it could examine and summarize the collected data, and provide an interactive diagram, hologram or video that takes the user through how to diagnose and fix the problem, he said. \u201cThis is the bigger play and the magic of generative AI,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worker would no longer be looking at a generic video; the tech would go through stacks of files, data, videos and pictures to put something very specific to address the problem.\u201d Another use case, he said, could be for worker training, such as showing someone how to repair an airplane engine based on the model and other specifications. \u201cI think we\u2019ll start to see this more in the next couple of product cycles,\u201d he said. \u201cThe race is on to see how quickly we can get generative AI into these devices.\u201d Meta, for example, has already expressed interest in teaming up with Microsoft, which has been heavily integrating its Copilot technology \u2013 powered by ChatGPT \u2013\u00a0 into its own suite of products. Llamas said a likely partnership would allow Meta\u2019s Quest headset lineup to utilize Copilot as an assistant or for training purposes. Google might follow in the same footsteps. Tuong Nygugen, a director analyst at market research firm Gartner, said \u201canyone who is invested in this market has to be thinking about it.\u201d \u201cNobody really knows what\u2019s a winner yet, so they\u2019re pulling together all these use cases right now, with a focus on enterprise, and making a case for why this is the future of experiences and devices,\u201d he said. For now, however, the focus will likely be on getting people comfortable using generative AI on the devices users are already using, especially the ones they hold in their hand. \u201cVision Pro just came out a few months ago and it needs to get its feet under it before it really starts to take off,\u201d Llamas said. \u201cWith iOS, we already have a base of users and products, so this is probably where Apple will accelerate now.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/tech/vision-pro-ai-apple/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_12_success_equal-pay-day-2024", "text": "March 12 marks Equal Pay Day in the United States, a symbolic date representing the number of days women have to work into the current year just to make the same amount of money men made in the prior one. Put another way, to make 12 months\u2019 worth of a man\u2019s median wages, a woman has to work about 14.5 months. In dollars and cents, for every dollar a man earns, a woman is paid 84 cents, according to the National Committee on Pay Equity and the Equal Pay Today campaign. That\u2019s based on earnings data for full-time, year-round workers from the US Census in 2022, which was the most recent full-year data set available. If part-time workers and those not employed year-round are included, the gender pay gap is worse, at 78 cents on the dollar, said Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates and director of Equal Pay Today. The size of the actual wage gap between men and women will widen or narrow depending on age, level of education, choice of occupation and tenure, as well as race and ethnicity. The gender pay gap is typically widest when comparing the earnings of White men to Black, Hispanic or Native American women. And, generally speaking, the gap is narrower in a given job when men and women are in their early- to mid-20s (i.e., when they are new to the workforce and before children come along), and also when comparing wages by title, tenure and education level within a given field. But no matter how you slice and dice the data, there are very few scenarios in which women on average earn the same as men. Indeed, in its latest analysis of median weekly earnings last year by occupation, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research found that women earned less than men not only in all 20 of the largest occupations for men but also in all 20 of the largest occupations for women. Among the largest occupations for women, the most egregious pay gaps were among financial managers (women earned 71% of every dollar a man earns), retail salesperson (72%), education and child care administrators (79%), administrative assistants (80%) and managers (81%). The narrowest gap was among cashiers, where women almost have pay parity (98%) with their male colleagues. Same old (and annoying) story every year While the overall gender pay gap has been narrowing over time \u2014 for example, Equal Pay Day in 2005 was April 19, a full five weeks later than this year\u2019s \u2014 the very fact that \ufeffsuch a gap exists at all in 2024 is a reminder that employers and society still have work to do in recognizing the value of women\u2019s contributions at work. \u201cThe gender wage gap is a national disgrace,\u201d said\u00a0Jamila Taylor, IWPR\u2019s president and CEO, in a statement. \u201cEven in professions typically dominated by women, men earn more for doing the same job. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than a half-century, yet\u00a0women still cannot get fair treatment when it comes to employment and earnings. And it\u2019s worse for women of color, who face rampant racial discrimination in the workforce in addition to ongoing pay inequities.\u201d The good news is that there are now multiple efforts that may over time help reduce the problem. They include an increasing number of state-level pay transparency laws and bans on employers asking job candidates for their salary histories, which can help chronically underpaid women gain more of an equal footing when they apply for new jobs. There is also now a ban on federal government agencies asking job candidates\u2019 for their salary history and a proposed rule that would prohibit federal contractors from doing the same, as well as requiring them to post in their job ads the pay for given positions. But Vagins and others in the campaign for equal pay also want to see action at the federal legislative level, supporting two bills: the Salary Transparency Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which have been introduced in the US House and Senate multiple times. For instance, the Paycheck Fairness Act would, according to Equal Pay Today, \u201cbar retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages; close loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same work \u2026 [and] ensure women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity.\u201d Absent such federal laws requiring all employers to make equal pay more of an imperative, Vagins said, achieving true pay parity for women will be slow in coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/12/success/equal-pay-day-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_20_success_interest-rates-savings-cash", "text": "The Federal Reserve\u2019s benchmark interest rate remains at a 23-year high. That\u2019s thanks to the central bank\u2019s decision Wednesday to once again hold it steady, as it has done at the policy-making committee\u2019s past five meetings. That decision may be disappointing to some investors, homebuyers and those with a lot of credit card debt, since movement in the Fed\u2019s overnight lending rate influences rates \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 on consumer financial products (e.g., credit cards, bank loans and mortgages). But\u00a0with the Fed signaling that no rate cuts are likely until summer, it also means anyone with savings still has at least a few more months to make hay of their stash. That\u2019s because you can still get inflation-beating interest rates that will grow any money you have set aside for emergencies, vacations, down payments or any other goal in your sights over the next several years. However, that won\u2019t happen if you just let it sit in a traditional checking or savings account that yields next to nothing. There are more lucrative, low-risk options out there, with rates that are still at or near their peaks. \u201cBut perhaps not for much longer,\u201d said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIf one of those fits into your financial plans, it\u2019s best to act soon.\u201d So, consider the following options when deciding where to park your hard-earned savings. High-yield online savings accounts The average annual percentage yield on bank savings accounts was just 0.52% as of March 13, according to Bankrate. That average is kept low by the biggest brick-and-mortar banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which still are offering a paltry 0.01%. By contrast, there are still FDIC-insured online banks offering inflation-beating rates of between 4.35% and 5.35% on their high-yield savings accounts. Generally speaking, these are the best vehicles in which to keep your emergency funds for quick, easy access. Choosing between an account that pays 0.52% and one that pays 5.35% can mean forfeiting hundreds of dollars in interest. \u201cIf you put $10,000 in a savings account, that\u2019s a difference of $496 in interest earnings over the course of the year, assuming monthly compounding,\u201d Rossman said. While the rates on high-yield savings accounts have gone down a bit in recent months, \u201cwidespread cuts in online savings account rates are unlikely until the first Fed rate cut is near,\u201d said Ken Tumin, founder of DepositAccounts.com. As with any bank savings rate, high-yield savings account\u00a0rates\u00a0can change overnight, and the bank may not alert you when it lowers it. So make sure to check your monthly statement. Certificates of deposits Another high-return, low-risk investment that is great for money you likely won\u2019t need to tap for a few months or even a couple of years is a certificate of deposit. You can get the best returns on CDs through a brokerage such as Schwab, E*Trade or Fidelity. That\u2019s because you can comparison shop for CDs from any number of FDIC-insured banks and will not have to set up individual accounts with each institution. As of March 13, the average rate on a one-year CD was 1.95%, but some banks are offering as much are 5.4%. If you can get a one-year CD at, say, 5.4%, you will make $540 on a $10,000 investment. To get the greatest benefit from a CD, you have to leave the money invested for a fixed period. You can always access your principal sooner if you need to, but there may be early withdrawal penalties. As of March 20, CDs listed on Schwab.com with durations from three months up to three years were all yielding between 5.2% and 5.51%. CD rates on durations between four and 10 years ranged from 4.40% to 5.15%. Say you invest $10,000 in a one-year CD with a 5.36%\u00a0APY. At the end of that period, you\u2019d get your principal back plus $536 in interest when the CD matures, according to Bankrate\u2019s CD calculator. If you chose a two-year CD at 5.25%, you\u2019d bank an extra $1,078, assuming compounding interest. The same investment in a five-year CD at 5.15% would earn $2,854. \u201cIt makes sense to go long with CDs. To hedge your bets, include terms from one to five years. Starting a CD ladder will provide this mix,\u201d Tumin said. If you don\u2019t go through a brokerage you may get a reasonable deal from your primary bank, Tumin said. For example, he noted, Wells Fargo is still offering up to 5.01% on both 4-month and 7-month CDs. Or, at Bank of America, you can get up to 4.75% on a 7-month CD. But Tumin cautions that with any big bank CD you should take your money out at the end of the term, otherwise your bank may automatically renew it and lock you in to a much lower-yielding CD. Money market accounts and funds If you don\u2019t want to set up an online savings account at another bank, your own bank may offer you a money market deposit account that pays a higher yield than your regular checking or savings accounts. Money market accounts may have higher minimum deposit requirements than a regular savings account, but they are more liquid than a fixed-term certificate of deposit or Treasury bill, meaning they give you access to your money more quickly while still potentially giving you some of the highest yields available, said Doug Ornstein, senior manager for integrated solutions at TIAA Wealth Management. But don\u2019t confuse money market accounts with money market mutual funds, which invest in short-term, low-risk debt instruments. As of March 19, they had an average 7-day yield of 5.14%, according to the Crane Money Fund Index, which tracks the top 100 taxable money market funds. Unlike money market deposit accounts, money market mutual funds are not insured by the FDIC. But if you invest in a money market fund through a brokerage, your overall account is likely to be insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which offers protection in the event your brokerage ever goes under. Treasury bills and notes Another option for money you can leave untouched anywhere from several months to a few years is to buy short-term Treasury bills and medium-term notes, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Three- and six-month bills had yields of 5.39% and 5.33%\u00a0respectively on March 20 before the Fed\u2019s meeting ended, while nine-month and one-year bills were offering 5.19% and 5.08%\u00a0respectively, according to rates posted on Schwab.com for a $25,000 investment. Rates on Treasury notes with durations from two years to 10 years ranged between 4.29% and 4.72%. If you\u2019re someone who manages your portfolio like a hawk, you may feel comfortable buying T-bills on your own from TreasuryDirect.gov. But if you don\u2019t, it might be easier just to buy new issues through your brokerage account or invest in a short-term bond index fund or ETF, said Andy Smith, executive director of financial planning at Edelman Financial Engines. And if you\u2019re looking at money that will be needed in three to five years, you might consider a diversified fund of highly rated government and corporate bonds, Ornstein said. An 18-month AAA-rated corporate bond, for instance, was yielding 4.82% this week, while the three-year was at 4.49%. Meanwhile, three-year AAA-rated municipal bonds (which are issued by local governments) had a rate of 3.98%, according to Schwab.com. Don\u2019t chase yield When deciding on the best accounts and investments for your specific goals and peace of mind, it may pay to consult a fee-only fiduciary adviser \u2014 meaning, someone who doesn\u2019t get paid a commission to sell you a particular investment. What you\u2019ll always want to do is build in flexibility for yourself so you can easily access cash, regardless of your timeline for key goals. \u201cWhat happens if something changes and you need that down payment a lot sooner \u2014 or your parents need medical care fast?\u201d Smith said. That means balancing your desire for great yield with a need and desire for ease of access without penalty. Translation: Don\u2019t chase yield for yield\u2019s sake. Think of it this way, Ornstein said: Unless you have huge sums to invest or are an institutional investor, the difference between getting a 5.1% yield versus 5% is negligible, and in fact it could even cost you more if there are penalties for taking your money out early. \u201cMost of the time convenience is really important. Give up the 0.1%,\u201d he advised.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/20/success/interest-rates-savings-cash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}

These days, it\u2019s trying a different approach. The cereal brand has partnered with Molly Baz, a cookbook author who was recently the star of a buzzy ad for lactation cookies, on a limited edition cereal box. It\u2019s the first cereal box featuring a pregnant woman, according to the brand. The box, which shows Baz with an exposed pregnant belly, is available for purchase on the Kellogg website. It\u2019s part of the brand\u2019s \u201cSpecial for a Reason\u201d marketing campaign, which features \u201cinspiring individuals.\u201d Partnering with popular figures could be a way for a brand to try to jumpstart interest in a stale category. WK Kellogg, which owns Special K, Corn Flakes, Kashi and other cereal stalwarts, reported that net sales fell 1.9% year-over-year in the quarter ending on March 30. Baz sparked a conversation around the depiction of pregnant bodies thanks to a recent ad campaign for Swehl, a company that sells accessories for breastfeeding parents and offers a cookie recipe developed with the writer.

{"id": "2023_11_20_investing_microsoft-stock-record-high-altman-openai", "text": "Microsoft stock reached a record high on Monday after the company said that Sam Altman, former chief executive of OpenAI, will join the company to head its artificial intelligence innovation leg. Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing. Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive. Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year. The stock is one of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d that have powered the lion\u2019s share of the market\u2019s returns this year, boosted by Wall Street\u2019s bet that artificial intelligence is the next big thing in tech.

Other members of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d saw a boost on Monday. Nvidia shares gained 2.3% to end the trading session at $504.20 ahead of its earnings due on Tuesday, notching a record-high close for the chipmaker.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/20/investing/microsoft-stock-record-high-altman-openai/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_business_american-consumer-economic-engine", "text": "It\u2019s becoming tougher and tougher for Americans to carry on with their spending spree. Years of elevated inflation and the highest interest rates in almost a quarter century are wearing out the US consumer. Savings accumulated during the Covid-19 pandemic are drying up, borrowers continue to rack up debt and delinquencies are marching higher. Retailers say shoppers are fed up with rising prices and are changing their purchasing behavior. Americans power economic growth with their spending, and they\u2019re being buffeted from every direction. US consumers unleashed a tsunami of demand when the economy ascended from pandemic depths. That momentum persisted last year as Americans gladly opened their wallets, selling out high-profile concerts and breaking travel records, which also staved off a widely anticipated recession. Such exuberance is being kept alive by America\u2019s solid job market, with sub-4% unemployment, nearly two million job openings more than unemployed people seeking work and wages that are outpacing inflation. The job market is proving to be the US economy\u2019s saving grace, but it is unmistakable that Americans are feeling pinched. Once that shoe drops, it could cause an earthquake for the world\u2019s biggest economy. \u201cAs long as people stay employed, they\u2019ll continue to spend because it\u2019s hard to pull back dramatically without feeling like you\u2019re shortchanging yourself,\u201d Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office, told CNN. \u201cBut consumers are being very selective now, and they will cut back if they have to.\u201d A slowdown according to economic data Given the barrage of economic hurdles facing consumers, economists are paying close attention for a turning point. Sales at US retailers and restaurants were unexpectedly flat in April, missing the 0.4% gain economists projected. Retail spending, which is adjusted for seasonal swings but not inflation, was also revised down for March. A second estimate of gross domestic product, released Thursday, showed that consumer spending was weaker in the first three months of the year than initially reported. Consumption, which accounts for about two-thirds of the US economy, advanced 2% in the first quarter, down from the 2.5% reflected in the first estimate. That resulted in gross domestic product overall to be revised down to a 1.3% annualized rate, compared to the 1.6% initially estimated. Economists polled by FactSet are expecting data to be released Friday to show that consumer spending slowed notably in April from March. But perhaps the most unsettling economic release that came in below economists\u2019 expectations was the employment report for April. Employers added just 175,000 jobs last month, a big miss from the 235,000 jobs economists projected in a FactSet poll. And instead of holding steady at 3.8%, as expected, the unemployment rate edged higher to 3.9%. The job market is humming along just fine for now, but for how much longer remains to be seen. It\u2019s unclear if the recent slate of disappointing figures means the economy will weaken further or rebound because one month\u2019s data \u2014 not even one quarter\u2019s \u2014 does not make a trend. Warnings from retailers Retail earnings have painted a mixed picture, but lower and middle-income customers are now pulling back. Walmart (WMT) saw customers across income brackets shop more frequently at the chain across the first three months of the year, including higher-income consumers buying groceries in a sign that consumers are squeezed. Other chains have seen similar signals. Lower-income consumers bought more private-label brands and $1 items at Dollar General during its latest quarter, that company said. Kohl\u2019s (KSS) stock plunged more than 20% Thursday after weak quarterly results, showing how middle-income customers have pulled back on non-essential clothing and discretionary merchandise at department stores. \u201cOur customers continue to be pressured by a number of economic factors, including high interest rates and inflation,\u201d Kohl\u2019s CEO Thomas Kingsbury said on a call with analysts on Thursday. \u201cOur middle income customer continues to be impacted.\u201d Target, Home Depot and Best Buy, which have been some of the strongest retailers in recent years, have taken a hit from the pullback in discretionary goods. Many retailers have slashed prices and ramped up discounts to try to boost demand.Still, there have been bright spots in the retail industry. TJX, the parent of TJ Maxx and Home Goods, has surged as consumers seek out bargains. And Abercrombie & Fitch, a 1990s mainstay, has tapped into consumer nostalgia to revitalize the brand. Economists were humbled last year when their bets that the economy would fall into a recession proved to be flat-out wrong, so the economy\u2019s resilience ought not to be underestimated. But the latest data and earnings results show that the economic landscape remains undeniably tough and it is putting Americans to the test.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/business/american-consumer-economic-engine/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_tech_openai-insiders-letter", "text": "A group of OpenAI insiders are demanding that artificial intelligence companies be far more transparent about AI\u2019s \u201cserious risks\u201d \u2014 and that they protect employees who voice concerns about the technology they\u2019re building. \u201cAI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight,\u201d reads the open letter posted Tuesday signed by current and former employees at AI companies including OpenAI, the creator behind the viral ChatGPT tool. They also called for AI companies to foster \u201ca culture of open criticism\u201d that welcomes, rather than punishes, people who speak up about their concerns, especially as the law struggles to catch up to the quickly advancing technology. Companies have acknowledged the \u201cserious risks\u201d posed by AI \u2014 from manipulation to a loss of control, known as \u201csingularity,\u201d that could potentially result in human extinction \u2014 but they should be be doing more to educate the public about risks and protective measures, the group wrote. As the law currently stands, the AI employees said, they don\u2019t believe AI companies will share critical information about the technology voluntarily. It\u2019s essential, then, for current and former employees to speak up \u2014 and for companies not to enforce \u201cdisparagement\u201d agreements or otherwise retaliate against those who voice risk-related concerns. \u201cOrdinary whistleblower protections are insufficient because they focus on illegal activity, whereas many of the risks we are concerned about are not yet regulated,\u201d the group wrote. Their letter comes as companies move quickly to implement generative AI tools into their products, while government regulators, companies and consumers grapple with responsible use. Meanwhile many tech experts, researchers and leaders have called for a temporary pause in the AI race, or for the government to step in and create a moratorium. OpenAI\u2019s response In response to the letter, OpenAI spokesperson told CNN it is \u201cproud of our track record providing the most capable and safest AI systems and believe in our scientific approach to addressing risk, adding that the company agrees \u201crigorous debate is crucial given the significance of this technology.\u201d OpenAI noted it has an anonymous integrity hotline and a Safety and Security Committee led by members of its board and safety leaders from the company. The company does not sell personal info, build user profiles, or use that data to target anyone or sell anything. But Daniel Ziegler, one of the organizers behind the letter and an early machine-learning engineer who worked at OpenAI between 2018 and 2021, told CNN that it\u2019s important to remain skeptical of the company\u2019s commitment to transparency. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to tell from the outside how seriously they\u2019re taking their commitments for safety evaluations and figuring out societal harms, especially as there is such strong commercial pressures to move very quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to have the right culture and processes so that employees can speak out in targeted ways when they have concerns.\u201d He hopes more professionals in the AI industry will go public with their concerns as a result of the letter. Meanwhile, Apple is widely expected to announce a partnership with OpenAI at its annual Worldwide Developer Conference to bring generative AI to the iPhone. \u201cWe see generative AI as a key opportunity across our products and believe we have advantages that set us apart there,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the company\u2019s most recent earnings call in early May.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/tech/openai-insiders-letter/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_22_media_ronna-mcdaniel-nbc", "text": "NBC News on Friday announced that it had hired Ronna McDaniel, the former Republican National Committee chair who has repeatedly\u00a0attacked the network and its journalists,\u00a0assailed the\u00a0news\u00a0media as \u201cfake news\u201d and promoted false claims around the 2020\u00a0vote,\u00a0as an on-air commentator\u00a0ahead of the 2024 presidential election. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of politics at NBC News, said in a memo\u00a0to staff. McDaniel exited the RNC earlier this month after leading the organization since 2016. During her time as chair, McDaniel repeatedly attacked the press, which has become increasingly popular in Republican circles over the last several years as Donald Trump demonizes journalists and news institutions. McDaniel echoed many such attacks, labeling the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and calling the media \u201ccorrupt.\u201d At times, she even targeted NBC News\u00a0and MSNBC\u00a0with dishonest attacks. In 2019, for instance, McDaniel accused Richard Engel, NBC News\u2019 chief foreign correspondent, of \u201cactively cheering for an economic downturn.\u201d \u201cHow can NBC let him keep his job when he\u2019s made his bias so clear?\u201d McDaniel asked. McDaniel has a lengthier history attacking the progressive cable news channel MSNBC, which she will appear on in her new role. In recent years, she has repeatedly attacked the channel for \u201cspreading lies\u201d and blasted those she described as the network\u2019s \u201cprimetime propagandists.\u201d An NBC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about her attacks on the news media and NBC. In her role as RNC chief, McDaniel also fanned the flames of election denialism after the 2020 presidential contest. McDaniel was involved in a phone call in 2020 to pressure Michigan county officials not to certify the vote from the Detroit area, where Joe Biden had a commanding lead. McDaniel\u00a0told the officials, regarding the certification: \u201cDo not sign it. \u2026 We will get you attorneys.\u201d The Michigan Department of State\u2019s office condemned her claims of supposed voter fraud in the wake of the election, stating they had \u201cno merit.\u201d\u00a0The state\u2019s \u201celections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d it said in a\u00a0detailed fact check\u00a0posted online. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace last year, McDaniel defended her claims of voting \u201cirregularity\u201d in the election. \u201cI think saying that there were problems with 2020 is very real. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s election denying,\u201d McDaniel told Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m from Wayne County. We had a woman send a note saying I\u2019m being told to backdate ballots. We had to look into that. That\u2019s deeply concerning. When you have friends who are poll-watching and being kicked out, that\u2019s deeply concerning. We have every right to look at that.\u201d In the interview,\u00a0Wallace pressed McDaniel if she believed Biden legitimately won the election. \u201cI think there were lots of problems with 2020. Ultimately, he won the election\u00a0but there were lots of problems with the 2020 election,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he won it fair. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to say that.\u201d NBC\u2019s hiring of McDaniel, however, plays into a recent trend at the\u00a0network\u2019s outlets, which has seemingly softened its stance on Trump as he inches toward the Republican nomination for president. Earlier this month, CNBC hosted Trump for a lengthy phone interview in which the network\u2019s anchors allowed him to peddle lies and conspiracy theories on air\u00a0without scrutiny. MSNBC has even started carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live on television, a practice that the network boasted for years it would not do. Star host Rachel Maddow, who has said carrying Trump\u2019s lies\u00a0on the air\u00a0is dangerous, even objected to the network broadcasting a recent speech from the presumptive Republican nominee, calling it \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/22/media/ronna-mcdaniel-nbc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}

Earlier, the company said a problem prevented many AT&T customers from completing calls between carriers. \u201cThe interoperability issue between carriers has been resolved,\u201d an AT&T spokesperson said. \u201cWe collaborated with the other carrier to find a solution and appreciate our customers patience during this period.\u201d In a previous statement sent to CNN, the company said a problem prevented many AT&T customers from completing calls between carriers. That also means customers from a rival service could not place calls to an AT&T customer. Although AT&T did not share the number of impacted customers, website Down Detector shows a spike in reports of issues using the service starting around 1 pm ET. Those numbers climbed in the hours that followed. By 6 pm ET, however, the number of reported incidents started to decline, according to Down Detector. The site listed New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, Pittsburgh and Indianapolis as among the cities with the most reports of issues. Because of the interoperability problem, thousands of Verizon customers also reported a service outage on Down Detector Tuesday. AT&T told CNN that 911 calls went through, despite a few locations, including Camden County, Georgia, and Scranton, Pennsylvania, issuing alerts on social media that the outage was disrupting calls to 911. AT&T told CNN the alerts were received accidentally after a template for such a notification was triggered and sent. AT&T said it is investigating why that happened. The outage comes less than four months after a massive disruption that knocked out service for AT&T\u2019s network for nearly 12 hours. In February, tens of thousands of AT&T customers in America were unable to make phone calls, send texts, reach emergency services or access the internet because of an AT&T network outage. In March, the telecommunications company said it had been hacked in a separate incident, and the stolen data contained information such as account holders\u2019 Social Security numbers.

{"id": "2024_06_03_tech_russia-paris-olympics-influence-ops", "text": "Pro-Russian propagandists are ramping up their efforts to denigrate next month\u2019s Paris Summer Olympics and undermine Western support for Ukraine through a series of brazen online and offline stunts, private experts and Western officials told CNN. The stunts have included using artificial intelligence to impersonate the actor Tom Cruise\u2019s voice narrating a fake documentary attacking the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and placing coffins with an inscription invoking the Ukraine war near the Eiffel Tower, sources said. The activity appears to be part of an increasingly frantic effort from Russian operatives to tarnish the Olympics and stall any momentum Ukraine is building to use Western-made weapons to attack Russian territory, experts who track Russian disinformation told CNN. The IOC has placed restrictions on Russian athletes\u2019 participation in the Paris Olympics because of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. There is a mix of desperation and opportunism to the recent spate of propaganda, said Gavin Wilde, a former Russia expert at the National Security Council. \u201cFor the tech-savvy propagandists working in Russia, the alternative they\u2019re hedging against isn\u2019t irrelevance \u2014 it\u2019s a one-way trip to the front lines,\u201d Wilde told CNN. Russia\u2019s embassy in France called the allegations \u201cRussophobic.\u201d \u201cThe Embassy declares that the Russian Federation has never interfered and does not interfere in the internal affairs of France - our country has other more important priorities,\u201d the embassy said in a statement posted in French. \u201cThe Embassy urges the French authorities to put an end to this unfounded and unjustified anti-Russian disinformation campaign.\u201d Campaign to undermine the West The Russian operatives used the fake Cruise voice, the Netflix logo and even a fake New York Times review to try to lend the documentary legitimacy, according to analysts at Microsoft, who released a\u00a0report\u00a0on the activity on Sunday. The propaganda video, released on social media platform Telegram last year, was \u201cthe first glimpse of what would prove to be an extensive campaign\u201d by the same Russian propaganda actor to smear the Paris Olympics, Microsoft said. Russian propagandists have also been ginning up fake news stories claiming that Parisians are buying property insurance because of fears of terrorism around the Olympics, and fake press releases purporting to come from the CIA and French intelligence warning about terrorism, according to Microsoft. CNN has requested comment from the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC. Not all the recent subterfuge has been online. On Saturday, French police discovered five coffins draped in the French flag, with the words \u201cFrench soldiers in Ukraine,\u201d near the Eiffel Tower. A French military official told CNN they suspect that Russia was involved in the stunt. French police are questioning three men in connection with the incident. French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s refusal to rule out the possibility of sending French troops to Ukraine has\u00a0infuriated\u00a0the Russian government. In recent days, pro-Russia social media accounts have also shared a doctored video of US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller commenting on Ukraine\u2019s potential use of US-made weapons in Russia. The video appears to be compiled from two different press appearances by Miller, showing him wearing different ties. It\u2019s unclear who made the video. US officials and private experts have not publicly identified the source of the video. \u201cWhile this video is obviously fake, it is a step towards what counter-disinformation researchers have been warning about \u2013 the use of AI manipulated media to enhance foreign disinformation operations,\u201d the State Department said in a statement to CNN. The Russian Embassy in South Africa shared a version of the video on its X accounts,\u00a0according\u00a0to screenshots captured by a BBC journalist. Hany Farid, a digital forensic expert and professor at UC Berkley, said the video had hallmarks of being manipulate using AI. Farid ran the video through multiple deepfake detection systems and said they indicated that the voices in the video had been created using AI and that the lip movements of the State Department spokesperson in the video had been altered using lip-sync AI software. \u201cEven if the fake is not believed by everyone, the constant bombardment of deepfakes is leading to an overall skepticism of everything we see online,\u201d Farid said. But Lee Foster, another information operations expert, expressed skepticism that the imagery in the video was made using AI. \u201cLooking at it from an analytic standpoint, it doesn\u2019t make sense to use AI to manipulate mouth movements such that they are basically identical to the original,\u201d Foster told CNN. \u201cAI manipulation of the video\u2019s audio remains an unresolved question, however.\u201d Ghosts of Olympics past Russian antagonism toward the IOC has been years in the making. The IOC has prohibited Russian athletes from competing officially under the Russian flag in Paris because of the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russian athletes have faced similar restrictions at past Olympic games because of Russia\u2019s alleged doping program. Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency was behind a destructive cyberattack on computers used at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in South Korea in 2018,\u00a0according\u00a0to the US Justice Department. Officials at the Paris Olympics are bracing for a similar threat next month. \u201cThe GRU has reserved some its most serious cyberattacks for France and the Olympics, and they carried those out when the geopolitical situation was considerably less strained,\u201d said John Hultquist, chief analyst at the Google-owned cybersecurity firm Mandiant. The Olympic Games in Paris \u201cwill be an incredibly enticing target for these actors,\u201d Hultquist added. \u201cAny attack they cook up will be designed to undermine French prestige and the solidarity at the heart of the event.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/tech/russia-paris-olympics-influence-ops/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}

You can sign up\u00a0right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. YOLO economy, meet the \u201cyo, no\u201d economy. Not so long ago many of us were willing, if not eager, to shell out on fancy new TVs, upgraded bathrooms and kitchens, Peloton bikes and bottles of the good stuff. Things have changed. This summer, our bathrooms are outdated and our champagne bottles corked. Americans emerged from pandemic lockdowns with better jobs, extra spending money and a burning desire to live life outside of the confines of their own abodes, regardless of the price. In what was dubbed the YOLO economy (short for \u201cyou only live once\u201d), or revenge spending, consumers shelled out for the experiences and goods they had missed. \u201cCovid showed all of us that life doesn\u2019t go on forever,\u201d Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, told Before the Bell. \u201cPreparing for a retirement that\u2019s way off into the future and could be interrupted by something like a global pandemic changed our mindsets. People wanted to live in the moment.\u201d Now, five years after the onset of the pandemic, the free-spending party is coming to an end. And that may be bad news for the economy. What\u2019s going on: Consumer spending is falling back to earth, and even the highest-income Americans are turning to discount retailers like Walmart. Target is slashing prices to lure reluctant shoppers back into their stores, and sweet-treat shops like Starbucks have reported that sales aren\u2019t growing like they used to be \u2014 a Frappuccino no longer feels like a necessary expense. So what\u2019s happening? Inflation is still elevated and consumers are running out of their Covid-era savings, the job market is beginning to tighten and workers are getting worried about losing their jobs. There\u2019s also another explanation: Americans have gotten their post-Covid ya-ya\u2019s out and are ready to tone things down again. \u201cThere is an element of \u2018how long can I live in this PTSD post-Covid environment?\u2019\u201d said Samana. \u201cAt some point you do have to figure out what the new normal looks like. Employers want workers back more often in the office and in certain locations, you can\u2019t work from anywhere anymore, that\u2019s also changing mindsets. There\u2019s this sense of reversion to the mean.\u201d Well, they\u2019re paring back in some areas. People are still willing to shell out for Taylor Swift concerts and plane tickets. Memorial Day travel was at its highest level in history, according to the TSA. But that means people are paring back their discretionary purchases and looking to trade down in everyday necessities, too. What it means: We\u2019ve written extensively at Before the Bell about how consumer spending saved the US economy from recession in the high-inflation and interest rate years following the pandemic. And it still continues to be the most important measure of a strong economy \u2014 spending accounts for about 70% of gross domestic product, the go-to measure of US economic health. So if that slows, that would be bad news and could potentially trigger the recession that economists began warning about way back in 2021. (Don\u2019t worry, most economists at major banks and firms don\u2019t predict that will happen anytime soon, and if it does happen, it might be not be a slowdown for everyone.) It\u2019s also rattling markets and keeping investors on edge \u2014 the Dow dropped more than 1,000 points between Tuesday and Thursday last week on unexpected economic data. It dropped another 115 points on Monday after a report showed that the manufacturing industry had contracted slightly. \u201cThere\u2019s really no indication that all of the factors weighing on the consumers\u2019 mind are going to ease up anytime soon,\u201d said Samana. What comes next: These next two weeks will be important for investors, consumers and general economy-watchers. Official jobs data for the month of May will be released on Friday and analysts will pore over the numbers for hints about whether the labor market will continue to loosen. Next week, the Federal Reserve holds its policy meeting where officials will also release their outlook for employment, inflation and interest rates in the months to come. It\u2019s highly unlikely that we\u2019ll see any change in interest rates at that meeting, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell could provide some guidance on when the central bank expects to begin its pivot. The New York Stock Exchange suffered a bizarre glitch on Monday The New York Stock Exchange said Monday that a technical issue that halted trading for some major stocks and caused Berkshire Hathaway to be down 99.97% has been resolved. In an update, NYSE said impacted stocks have reopened and \u201call systems are currently operational.\u201d Intercontinental Exchange, the parent company of NYSE, has found no indication the glitch was caused by a cyberattack, a senior executive at a major bank in touch with ICE told CNN. Instead, an NYSE spokesperson said there was a \u201ctechnical issue\u201d with industry-wide price bands that \u201ctriggered\u201d trading halts on up to 40 symbols listed on NYSE Group exchanges. NYSE noted that those price bands are published by the Consolidated Tape Association\u2019s (CTA) Security Information Processor (SIP). CTA, an industry group, is responsible for publishing real-time trade and quote data. Dozens of stocks were paused earlier in the day, an indication they traded outside those so-called limit up-limit down bands, according to\u00a0NYSE\u2019s website. That list includes Chipotle and Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company run by legendary investor Warren Buffett. For nearly two hours, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Class A shares were listed as trading at just $185.10 \u2014 a price that would represent a loss of 99.97%. Berkshire closed at $627,400 on Friday.

The exchange said that ruling is not eligible for appeal and indicated it could cancel other trades. \u201cWe are monitoring the issue and engaging with market participants,\u201d a spokesperson for the Securities and Exchange Commission told CNN. Joe Saluzzi, co-founder of Themis Trading, told CNN that the NYSE\u2019s explanation is hard to square with the bizarre trades that hit the tape. \u201cI\u2019m not buying that explanation.

GameStop shares gain after meme stock influencer reveals $116 million bet Shares of GameStop climbed 21% on Monday as the renewed frenzy around\u00a0meme stocks\u00a0shows little sign of abating. The video game retailer\u2019s stock soared hours after a Reddit\u00a0post\u00a0by stocks influencer Keith Gill \u2014\u00a0also known as \u201cRoaring Kitty\u201d \u2014 revealed that he had bought nearly $116 million worth of the stock. GameStop\u2019s stock surged as much as 75% earlier in the day before parings its gains. The post was the first on Gill\u2019s Reddit account in more than three years, when\u00a0social media-fueled hype\u00a0around GameStop (GME) shares was in full swing. Meme stocks are shares that swing wildly in value based on their popularity among trader communities on social media rather than the companies\u2019 fundamental characteristics. The frenzy started with GameStop in 2021,\u00a0extending to other companies\u00a0such as AMC Entertainment (AMC) and Bed, Bath and Beyond, which has since\u00a0filed for bankruptcy. Shares of AMC Entertainment were up 11.1% on Monday. Read more from CNN\u2019s Anna Cooban here.

{"id": "2024_05_31_food_costco-hot-dog-price", "text": "Costco\u2019s new chief financial officer has a reassuring message for inflation-weary customers: don\u2019t worry about the price of the $1.50 hot dog-soda combo. \u201cTo\u00a0clear\u00a0up\u00a0some\u00a0recent\u00a0media\u00a0speculation,\u00a0I\u00a0also\u00a0want\u00a0to\u00a0confirm\u00a0the\u00a0$1.50\u00a0hot\u00a0dog\u00a0price is\u00a0safe,\u201d Costco CFO Gary Millerchip said on an earnings call with analysts Thursday. It was Millerchip\u2019s first earnings call with analysts since taking over for Richard Galanti, Costco\u2019s colorful finance chief of nearly four decades and the longest-serving CFO of a major US public company. With Costco\u2019s leadership change \u2014 and other longtime deals like Trader Joe\u2019s 19-cent bananas and Planet Fitness\u2019 $10 membership ending amid rising inflation \u2014 some had speculated about the future of Costco\u2019s $1.50 hot dog. The price has remained the same since 1985. If Costco\u2019s hot dog deal kept pace with inflation, it would be three times as expensive today \u2014 nearly $4.50. But Costco\u2019s $1.50 combo is a strategic decision, known as a loss-leader: The company is willing to lose money selling the hot dogs at that price as long as it helps Costco draw in and retain customers. It\u2019d be an odd time to raise prices, anyway. Other companies, such as Walmart and Target, have been cutting prices on thousands of items to draw in shoppers who are increasingly fed up with rising costs. The $1.50 hot dog is a powerful marketing tool for Costco and is synonymous with Costco\u2019s brand. \u201cI know it sounds crazy making a big deal about a hot dog, but we spend a lot of time on it,\u201d Costco co-founder Jim Sinegal told the\u00a0Seattle Times\u00a0in 2009. \u201cWe\u2019re known for that hot dog. That\u2019s something you don\u2019t mess with.\u201d Sinegal also famously once said, \u201cIf you raise the effing hot dog, I will kill you. Figure it out,\u201d according to former CEO Craig Jelinek. Costco offsets hot dog losses by increasing prices of pizzas and other items at its food courts and cutting costs. It also recently added chocolate chip cookies to its food court menu. The $2.49 double chocolate chunk cookie has been a \u201ccontinued success,\u201d Millerchip said Thursday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/food/costco-hot-dog-price/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_media_hunter-biden-trial-right-wing-media", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0A version of this article first appeared in the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\u00a0Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here. America\u2019s judicial system is, apparently, not so rigged, after all. After spending the last three days raging against the courts over\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a034 felony convictions, the right-wing media machine jumped at the opportunity to hype the felony charges being brought against\u00a0Hunter Biden\u00a0in a trial that got underway Monday. Outlets like\u00a0Fox News \u2014\u00a0where figures such as\u00a0Sean Hannity,\u00a0Laura Ingraham,\u00a0Jesse Watters and a parade of others have spent weeks bashing the legal system, even going as far as to portray the unanimous jury verdict to be part of a deep-state conspiracy against the disgraced former president \u2014 were more than happy to place a bright spotlight on the case facing\u00a0President\u00a0Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0son. The cognitive dissonance is remarkable to behold. The same media outlets and figures who have told their audiences that there is a \u201ctwo-tiered justice system\u201d in America, are now prominently covering a trial in which Biden\u2019s own\u00a0Justice Department\u00a0prosecutes his son. If Biden is rigging the justice system, he is doing a lousy job. The trial offers a timely distraction from the uncomfortable reality of Trump\u2019s felony convictions and marks the culmination of years of right-wing attacks and obsession of the president\u2019s son, offering a regular serving of red meat for Fox News\u2019 prime time audience over claims of wrongdoing and innuendo surrounding the purported \u201cBiden Crime Family.\u201d To be clear, the unprecedented nature of a president\u2019s own son going on trial for felony charges warrants significant coverage. However, while Trump\u2019s trial was treated as an illegitimate \u201csham\u201d by the MAGA Media machine, the Hunter Biden trial is being portrayed in a markedly different light. Oddly, the charges brought against President Biden\u2019s son don\u2019t represent \u201celection interference.\u201d Apparently, that\u2019s only a one way street. While there is not a \u201ctwo-tiered justice system\u201d in the country, there certainly is a two-tiered set of standards that outlets like Fox News apply to the Democratic Party versus the Republican Party. Not only are the charges against Hunter Biden being taken very seriously by the same outlets which have spilled untold amounts of ink blasting the courts, but these same outlets are also dishonestly attempting to tie President Biden to the alleged crimes of his son, despite the fact that the GOP has been unable to uncover any evidence establishing such a link. And, suffice to say, it is not like the\u00a0Republican Party\u00a0has not tried. Regardless of what happens in the Hunter Biden trial, however, Trump\u2019s media allies will still undoubtedly claim that the justice system is rigged. If Hunter Biden is acquitted or the jury is hung, the right-wing media machine will use it to further their dishonest narrative that the judicial system is corrupt and only working to target Republicans. But, even if Hunter Biden is found guilty, audiences will be told that he got off easy and should have been hit with more severe charges. It\u2019s a win-win for MAGA Media, because the space is dominated by outlets and figures who are at their core dishonest, choosing to instead peddle certain narratives for profit and power.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/media/hunter-biden-trial-right-wing-media/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_media_caitlin-clark-media-coverage", "text": "The male-dominated sports media apparatus is stumbling over Caitlin Clark. It\u00a0is\u00a0trying to pretend that it hasn\u2019t ignored the WNBA for decades until the\u00a0superstar rookie\u00a0came along. But rather than admitting\u00a0its\u00a0blind spots, several male commentators are parachuting themselves into a\u00a0league\u00a0they barely understand\u00a0and dismissing anyone who suggests they could do better. It\u2019s getting ugly. In the flurry of hot takes that followed Chennedy Carter\u2019s foul against Clark over the weekend,\u00a0ESPN host Pat McAfee went on his show Monday to argue that Clark \u2014 whom he casually called the \u201cWhite b*tch for the Indiana team\u201d \u2014 was singularly responsible for the sudden surge of WNBA popularity and therefore she should be given more respect. He later apologized for using the slur, emphasizing that his broader thesis was that Clark\u2019s star power created a halo around a league that\u2019s been languishing in obscurity. \u201cI was talking about how I hoped that the WNBA and sports media, ex-WNBA players, would show a little bit more respect to Caitlin Clark for what she has brought to the WNBA,\u201d McAfee said on his show Tuesday. Of course, it\u2019s not that the league was dormant before Clark got there, it\u2019s that most of the mainstream press weren\u2019t paying attention. The impact of Clark\u2019s arrival is undeniable. But McAfee and the four men flanking him in\u00a0his\u00a0Indiana\u00a0studio are\u00a0not the best people to lead that conversation on one of the most influential sports networks in America. McAfee\u2019s right that the ground is shifting for women\u2019s basketball \u2014 it\u2019s one of those pivotal moments when journalists and analysts would normally call up an expert or two and try to absorb some of the complexities of the situation. Instead, the male commentariat have\u00a0done too much talking and not enough listening. Clark, a White, straight phenom, has become male sportscasters\u2019 proxy in a league built primarily by Black and LGBTQ athletes whom the mainstream felt fine skimming over in the past. And in covering the league, they\u2019re relying on outdated tropes about how women are supposed to behave. Charles Barkley recently called women \u201cpetty\u201d for being rough on Clark. \u201cY\u2019all should be thanking that girl for getting y\u2019all ass\u2019 private charters, all the money and visibility she brings into the WNBA,\u201d he said on TNT\u2019s \u201cInside the NBA.\u201d (TNT and CNN are both owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.) As the journalist Victoria Uwumarogie wrote in an essay for Essence this week, \u201cthe expectations Barkley has of men are vastly different from those he has for women, and that\u2019s similar to many of the other men who are, all of a sudden, WNBA experts now that Clark is in the league.\u201d Clark isn\u2019t in Iowa anymore. She\u2019s \u201cgoing up against women who\u2019ve been fighting for their just dues for years, including veterans and champions who were putting the league on the map before she stepped on the court,\u201d Uwumarogie writes. The league those women built has always been a physical one, a fact that Clark herself acknowledged in a postgame news conference. And that\u2019s the point basketball analyst Monica McNutt was making on ESPN\u2019s \u201cFirst Take\u201d\u00a0Monday. \u201cThere are so many layers in this conversation,\u201d McNutt says, while batting down the two men on screen who try to talk over her. \u201cThe prevailing sentiment for folks that are just joining the WNBA and following women\u2019s sports is\u00a0unfair to the women of this league \u2026 who have laid the groundwork for Caitlin Clark to come in and now take it to the next level.\u201d But host\u00a0Stephen A. Smith got all up in a huff when the criticism made him uncomfortable.\u00a0In response, Smith got defensive, asking, \u201cWho talks about the WNBA \u2026 who talks about women\u2019s sports more than \u2018First Take?\u2019\u201d McNutt\u00a0returned with a dagger: \u201cStephen A., respectfully, with your platform, you could have been doing this three years ago if you wanted to.\u201d The conversation fell apart, and the network went to commercial. Much like Clark, the mainstream sports media is new to the WNBA. And like any rookie season, it\u2019s been a rude awakening, full of stumbles and setbacks. Clark is learning how to navigate it. Let\u2019s hope the media can up its game, too.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/media/caitlin-clark-media-coverage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/05/2024", "section": "business"}}
