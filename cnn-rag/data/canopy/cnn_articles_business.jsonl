{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices", "text": "Actress Judy Garland never recorded her voice to read an audiobook of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but you\u2019ll soon be able to hear her rendition of the children\u2019s novel that inspired the movie nonetheless. Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2024_07_15_investing_trump-media-stock-shooting-truth-social", "text": "The value of former President Donald Trump\u2019s social media company spiked Monday after he was injured in an attempted assassination over the weekend. Trump Media & Technology Group\u2019s share price surged more than 30% Monday morning, putting it on track for what would be the biggest single-day gain since the company debuted in late March. During premarket trading, Trump Media shares skyrocketed by 70% at one point before the gains eased during regular trading. The spike is sharply lifting the value of Trump\u2019s dominant stake in the owner of Truth Social. At current prices, Trump\u2019s 114.75 million shares in Trump Media are worth nearly $5 billion. That\u2019s up from $3.5 billion on Friday, the day before Trump was shot at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trading under the ticker symbol \u201cDJT,\u201d Trump Media has achieved a massive valuation despite making little revenue and Truth Social remaining a tiny player in social media. Experts have said Trump Media is a meme stock: trading on momentum and hype, not fundamentals. For months, Trump Media has been a way for investors to bet on Trump returning to the White House, making Truth Social the primary platform for presidential communications. Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management, told CNN on Monday that traders are already speculating that Trump\u2019s chances of winning in November have gone up significantly in the past few days. \u201cYou are seeing the Trump trade on steroids here. DJT is the go-to,\u201d Tuttle said. The rally comes as Trump prepares to formally accept the Republican nomination for president at the convention in Milwaukee this week. Trump Media recently announced it has been added to the Russell 1000 Index of large-cap stocks and the Russell 3000 Index.

{"id": "2024_07_19_business_starbucks-mobile-orders-third-place", "text": "Years ago, some people would spend hours at Starbucks. Today, it\u2019s a takeout counter. At many Starbucks locations, you\u2019re lucky to find anyone sitting down. Under Howard Schultz, Starbucks\u2019 longtime leader, cafes were positioned as a \u201cthird place\u201d between work and home, where people could linger for hours on plush purple armchairs, socialize and connect. \u201cIf you look at the landscape of retail and restaurants in America, there is such a fracturing of places where people meet,\u201d Schultz said in a 1995 profile of Starbucks for an industry publication. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere for people to go. So we created a place where people can feel comfortable.\u201d The idea of Starbucks as a third place became part of its corporate mythology. Starbucks aimed to create a welcoming environment for coffee drinkers and employees with comfortable seating, jazz music and the aroma of freshly-brewed coffee. Employees who brewed and served Starbucks coffee, whom Starbucks called baristas,\u00a0handwrote customers\u2019 names on their drink orders. By the time Michelle Eisen joined Starbucks in 2010 as an employee in Buffalo, New York, her store was always packed during the holidays with people meeting friends and family. She witnessed first dates and helped a customer\u2019s propose to his spouse, writing \u201cwill you marry me?\u201d on a cup. \u201cIt was a cheerful, amazing thing to be part of it,\u201d she said of working at Starbucks and forming close relationships with customers. \u201cIt\u2019s why so many employees stayed for so long.\u201d Eisen has helped lead Starbucks Workers United, a group unionizing company stores. But Starbucks\u2019 business has transformed, and it has struggled to maintain its identity as that third place along the way. Mobile ordering and drive-thru Mobile app and drive-thru orders make up more than 70% of Starbucks\u2019 sales at its approximately 9,500 company-operated stores in the United States. In some stores, customers complained online that Starbucks pulled out comfortable chairs and replaced them with hard wooden stools. Starbucks has also built pickup-only stores without seating. Machines that print customers\u2019 names have replaced baristas\u2019 handwriting on cups. \u201cThird place is a broader definition,\u201d current Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan said last year. The \u201cclassic definition of third place \u2014 it\u2019s a box where I go to meet someone \u2014 it\u2019s frankly not relevant anymore in this context.\u201d Starbucks\u2019 sales in its home North America market dropped 3% last quarter. Schultz, who stepped down as Starbucks\u2019 CEO (for a third time) and retired from Starbucks\u2019 board of directors last year, wrote a lengthy message on LinkedIn in May about the company\u2019s issues. \u201cU.S. operations are the primary reason for the company\u2019s fall from grace. The stores require a maniacal focus on the customer experience,\u201d he said. The company needs to \u201cfocus on being experiential, not transactional.\u201d Starbucks\u2019 changes to its sit-down business model came in response to several trends \u2014 demand from customers for ordering coffee from their cars in drive-thru lanes or on their smartphones. The shift from a business serving hot coffee to one in which cold coffees, teas and lemonades make up more than half of sales. The Covid-19 pandemic, which forced cafes to shut indoor seating. Starbucks shifted to meet Wall Street\u2019s demands, too. Starbucks found it could reduce labor costs and increase order volume by running a mostly drive-thru and take-away coffee business. Starbucks also found difficulties with being America\u2019s third place and did not want to become the public space and bathroom for everyone, including people coming into stores who were homeless or struggling with mental health challenges on city streets. Starbucks has closed some stores and restricted bathroom access over safety concerns. But by prioritizing speed \u2014 \u201cthroughput\u201d in corporate parlance \u2014 Starbucks hurt the appeal of sitting down for coffee in stores, some critics say. \u201cTheir success has not enabled them to retain what people originally found so attractive about the brand,\u201d said Tom Cook, a principal at restaurant consultancy King-Casey who has worked with Starbucks. \u201cIt\u2019s turned into a transaction business that has very little interpersonal interaction and engagement.\u201d Many Starbucks\u2019 stores feel more like a fast-food restaurant than a coffee shop, Cook said. \u201cThey had this unique image and personality. That doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d \u2018Just another commodity product\u2019 Starbucks\u2019 shift from a sit-down shop to a primarily drive-thru and mobile pickup business has been gradual. The company was hesitant to build out drive-thru stores during the 1990s, fearing they would take away from the third place appeal. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to become just another commodity product,\u201d Starbucks finance chief Michael Casey said in the 1995 profile of the company. \u201cThe drive-thrus are a way for the converted to get their coffee a little quicker. It\u2019s not the way we want people to discover the Starbucks experience.\u201d But Starbucks warmed to the option, finding that many customers preferred the convenience of drive-thrus on their way to work. By 2005, nearly 15% of Starbucks\u2019 roughly 7,300 stores were drive-thru locations. For the first time that year, more than half of new Starbucks stores were drive-thru locations. Today, 70% of Starbucks locations have a drive-thru option. Mobile ordering was another major step in Starbucks\u2019 road to becoming primarily a take-away business. In 2014, Starbucks debuted its mobile ordering system, which allowed customers to place pickup orders from their smartphones without having to interact with an employee. Mobile ordering also gave the company more data on consumers and helped push them to Starbucks\u2019 loyalty program, benefiting Starbucks because loyalty members are its most profitable customers. Mobile ordering surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, when Starbucks was required to temporarily close seating areas inside to customers to prevent the virus\u2019 spread. Mobile orders jumped from 17% of sales in early 2020 to 26% the following year. Although mobile ordering has been popular with busy customers and investors, growing to more than 30% of sales today, it has taken away from the sit-down experience, analysts say. Starbucks baristas have complained about the crush of additional orders coming in from mobile orders and struggles to keep up with demand. People enter and exit stores more frequently, opening and closing the door and letting in the cold or heat. Mobile ordering \u201ccommoditized\u201d Starbucks by leading it to focus on order volume and efficiency, said Joe Pine, the co-founder of consultancy Strategic Horizons who wrote a recent article about Starbucks\u2019 struggles in Harvard Business Review. Starbucks\u2019 menu changes also had an impact on this shift. Starbucks is less of a coffee shop today and more of an iced tea, coffee, energy drink and lemonade store, especially in the summer, when nearly 80% of the drinks are cold. Customers are less interested in lingering in an air-conditioned store sipping iced coffee, analysts say. \u2018Reimagining the third place\u2019 Starbucks says that it\u2019s evolving its third place model from being a physical store to a feeling. In 2022, Starbucks said it was \u201creimagining the third place\u201d by investing $450 million in stores with new coffee-making equipment to improve efficiency for employees and improving Starbucks\u2019 mobile ordering system. One of these improvements is called the Siren System, which is designed to cut down the amount of time it takes to make cold drinks. Starbucks also is opening 2,000 new stores, including traditional Starbucks locations, pick-up stores, delivery-only stores and drive thru-only locations. Eisen, the Starbucks employee in Buffalo, said Starbucks has tried to balance competing demands from customers who want to grab their orders and go and others who want to sit down. The best way Starbucks can preserve the third place in the digital age is to improve ordering on the mobile app for both customers and workers, she said. That means reducing wait times for customers and easing the burden on Starbucks workers so they have enough time to prepare drinks and acknowledge customers when they come in to pick up their orders. \u201cIf the worker feels less stressed, they are able to greet the customer,\u201d she said. \u201cThat allows the Starbucks worker and the customer to have that connection.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/business/starbucks-mobile-orders-third-place/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_business_silicon-valley-tech-billionaires-trump", "text": "The Bay Area has long been, and remains, a hippie-dippie bastion of Democrats who voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020. But there\u2019s a small, powerful sect of Silicon Valley billionaires who are carving a path for the maybe-Trumpers and the MAGA-curious in the tech world. Elon Musk explicitly endorsed Trump over the weekend and, according to The Wall Street Journal, inked a nine-figure donation promise to a new pro-Trump political action committee called America PAC. David Sacks, the billionaire tech investor, co-hosted a fundraiser last month at his San Francisco home and spoke at the Republican National Convention on Monday. Other contributors to America PAC include the Winklevoss twins, Doug Leone of Sequoia Capital and Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, according to Federal Election Commission filings.  In the last election cycle, the few Trump backers who existed in the Valley largely kept their support under the radar. Their numbers are still small, but they\u2019re no longer hiding, and their wallets are open. So, what\u2019s gotten into these guys? For one, there might not be as many Trump supporters in the tech world as you might think. \u201cA mythology has been marketed by partisans suggesting a non-existent surge of tech titans abandoning the Democratic party support in a rush to support the Trump/Vance campaign.\u00a0The truth is that most leading tech figures do not support Trump/Vance and those prominent ones who do, were there years ago as well,\u201d Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, told CNN. And for the ones you might have heard of, most likely, it\u2019s not a sudden fervor for the far right\u2019s Christian extremism or a predilection for red baseball caps. Instead, they\u2019re looking out for the bottom line. The two biggest pain points for people in tech have been the Biden administration\u2019s record on antitrust enforcement and its attitude toward crypto, Adam Kovacevich, CEO of Chamber of Progress, a center-left tech policy group, told me. \u201cI don\u2019t think it has as much to do with Trump per se,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they would have probably stayed with Biden if they felt more care and attention was being paid to the innovation economy.\u201d In other words: It\u2019s not that the billionaires love Trump, it\u2019s that they really don\u2019t like Lina Khan, President Joe Biden\u2019s top antitrust crusader; or Gary Gensler, the Wall Street cop who\u2019s made no secret of his hostility toward digital assets. In recent years, Khan has spearheaded lawsuits against Amazon, Microsoft and Meta. In an interview with CNN last year, Khan described those efforts as part of a broader campaign to bring more of the government\u2019s resources to bear on the daily economic problems of ordinary Americans. But government regulation, however well intentioned, rarely sits well with the people who are getting rich off the status quo. Two of the most famous venture capitalists in the Valley, Marc Andreessen\u00a0and\u00a0Ben Horowitz, have committed to donating to America PAC, according to several news outlets. The pair haven\u2019t exactly been hiding their frustration with the Biden administration, either.  \u201cThe American government is now\u00a0far\u00a0more hostile to new startups than it used to be,\u201d they wrote in a recent blog post, which cited regulatory agencies using \u201cbrute force investigations, prosecutions, intimidation, and threats to hobble new industries.\u201d They also lamented the Biden administration\u2019s proposed tax on unrealized capital gains, which they said would \u201cabsolutely kill\u201d startups and the venture capital industry. One person familiar with their plans told the Financial Times that their pivot to Trump was because \u201cthere is so much at stake on the crypto side\u201d and the growth of artificial intelligence. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean support for (Trump\u2019s) views on immigration,\u201d the person told the paper. Historically, Trump hasn\u2019t shown a lot of love for tech bros, whose social media companies he long accused of having anti-conservative bias, especially after several of them suspended his accounts in response to the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. But the recent influx of tech money \u2014 facilitated in part by his 39-year-old venture-capitalist VP pick \u2014 appears to have softened some of Trump\u2019s Luddite-ish views. As recently as 2021, he called bitcoin a \u201cscam against the dollar.\u201d Lately, though, he\u2019s positioning himself as the crypto-friendly candidate. While his campaign hasn\u2019t laid out specific policy proposals around digital assets, it began accepting crypto donations this spring, and Trump is scheduled to speak at a national bitcoin conference next week. The Biden administration, meanwhile, is working to mend ties with industry leaders who say they\u2019ve been stymied by the SEC and Gensler, generally agreed to be the crypto community\u2019s Voldemort. To be sure, plenty of Big Tech dollars are still flowing to Biden and down-ballot Democrats from tech-world donors, including LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and Google co-founder Eric Schmidt. But Trump\u2019s gains from Silicon Valley have come just as some major Democratic donors have hit pause amid conversations about replacing the president on the ballot. And, as Kovacevich notes, just because there are a few big names turning toward Trump, \u201cthey\u2019re not speaking for everybody.\u201d \u201cIn fact, most of the big company CEOs aren\u2019t terribly involved in partisan politics,\u201d Kovacevich says. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to work with whoever wins the election.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/business/silicon-valley-tech-billionaires-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_cars_china-baidu-apollo-go-robotaxi-anxiety-intl-hnk", "text": "In China, it\u2019s possible to travel six miles in a driverless taxi for just about 50 cents. Self-driving cars, commonly called robotaxis, are being popularized at cut-throat prices in Wuhan, a sprawling metropolis of over 11 million people in central China. It has ambitions to become the world\u2019s first driverless city, even as the vehicles often struggle to navigate the streets. \u201cYou\u2019ll never have to buy a car,\u201d a passenger inside one of the white robotaxi sedans said in a video that has been viewed over 80 million times on Chinese social media platform Weibo since last week. The fleet of 500 vehicles operating in the city belongs to Apollo Go, a unit of Chinese tech giant Baidu (BIDU). They serve an area that covers roughly half of Wuhan\u2019s population, according to a May company release. A major selling point is the price. Base fares start as low as 4 yuan (55 cents), compared with 18 yuan ($2.48) for a taxi driven by a human, state media Global Times reported on Wednesday. The service launched in 2022 and started to gain traction during\u00a0the first half of the year. The company aims to double its fleet to 1,000 cars by the end of 2024. Wuhan currently has around 17,000 regular cabs, according to the city\u2019s transport bureau. But the rapid adoption of the driverless taxis has rattled China\u2019s gig economy workforce, which has suffered from stagnant wages because of deflationary forces stalking the economy following years of tight coronavirus restrictions and a real estate crisis. \u201cWith the Chinese economy struggling a bit, Chinese people are likely much more fearful of losing their jobs, and this serves as a reminder of one of the ways that could happen,\u201d Tu Le, managing director of Sino Auto Insights, told CNN in an email interview. He added that any significant job losses could be a few years away. On Monday, the National Bureau of Statistics reported that the country\u2019s gross domestic product expanded by just 4.7% in the April to June months, a much slower pace of growth than the 5.1% expected. There have also been complaints from residents in Wuhan about traffic jams, as driverless cars fail to respond to traffic lights. Earlier this month, one robotaxi ran a red light and crashed into a pedestrian, state-run paper People\u2019s Daily reported. \u2018Stealing\u2019 livelihoods Backlash against the service, particularly against Apollo Go\u2019s allegedly predatory pricing tactics, became the second top trending topic last week on Chinese microblogging site Weibo, with more than 75 million users chiming in on the discussion last week. \u201cDisrupting the market is the least of their worries. They will steal your rice bowl,\u201d one user wrote, referring to the ability to make a living. \u201cDriving schools, road inspectors, and taxis are all going to shut down,\u201d another user said. An Apollo Go spokesperson disputed that characterization. The person told CNN that discounts and subsidies from local governments are commonly used during the initial launch period to get people to try the service. The \u201cextremely low\u201d pricing was a temporary strategy, they added. Autonomous taxis currently operate on a relatively small scale in several cities around the world, mostly in the United States and China, while the United Arab Emirates is also welcoming companies worldwide to run driverless vehicle trials. Several US companies, including Waymo, a subsidiary of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet (GOOG), and GM (GM) subsidiary Cruise, are working on autonomous ride-sharing services but have recently faced setbacks. Cruise\u2019s permit to test fully autonomous vehicles in California was suspended in October 2023 after a series of collisions, including one that caused grievous injuries to a woman after dragging her across asphalt. The company is now being investigated by the Department of Justice. Waymo recently had to issue a recall after two of its cars hit the same tow truck within minutes of one another. Uncertainty over the safety and reliability of driverless cars has cast a long shadow over the industry in the US. But Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk isn\u2019t bothered, with the electrical vehicle giant vowing to unveil its robotaxi in the coming months. Conquering the roads China, already home to the world\u2019s biggest car market,\u00a0could someday also become the top market for automated vehicles, according to a 2023 report from consulting firm McKinsey. It projects the sector could generate between $300 billion to $400 billion in revenue by 2035 in part due to support from Beijing to roll out more pilot programs. Governments in several major Chinese cities, including Wuhan and Shenzhen, have granted commercial licenses for companies to pilot driverless services, while automakers and ride-hailing platforms are also investing in their automated fleets. Last week, authorities in Shanghai\u2019s Pudong New Area started handing out licenses to driverless car operators, including Apollo Go and Alibaba-backed AutoX, according to state media China Daily. California-based startup Pony.ai, backed by Toyota and Saudi Arabia, was also given the green light to test driverless vehicles in the financial hub. Officials in Beijing said in June that they were \u201csoliciting public opinion\u201d on regulations involving the use of autonomous vehicles for buses, taxis and car rental services. Earlier this month, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Economy and Information Technology issued draft guidelines stating that autonomous vehicles should have drivers or safety officers on board, or be able to be intercepted remotely. Any traffic violations should be handled based on local laws and regulations, it said. In the southern megacity of Shenzhen, Apollo Go was granted a license in February to run a trial in Bao\u2019an district, People\u2019s Daily reported, which allowed the company to charge. More such trials are expected across the country.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/cars/china-baidu-apollo-go-robotaxi-anxiety-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_media_lou-dobbs-dead", "text": "Lou Dobbs, the longtime business news anchor who became one of Donald Trump\u2019s most vocal supporters in media, died on Thursday. He was 78. \u201cIt\u2019s with a heavy heart that we announce the passing of \u2018the great Lou\u00a0Dobbs,\u2019\u201d a statement posted on his official social media account said, calling him a \u201cfighter till the very end.\u201d Dobbs had a lengthy career in broadcast journalism, spending more than two decades at CNN, which he joined at its inception in 1980 and anchoring the program \u201cMoneyline.\u201d Dobbs left CNN in 2009 to help media mogul Rupert Murdoch launch the Fox Business Network. \u201cLou was one of the CNN originals, who helped launch and shape the network. We are saddened to hear about his passing and extend our sincerest condolences to his wife Debi, children and his family,\u201d a CNN spokesperson said. As Donald Trump ascended in Republican Party politics, Dobbs became one of his most ardent supporters, using his program to promote anti-immigrant rhetoric and lash out at the so-called \u201cdeep state.\u201d As one of Trump\u2019s biggest boosters on television, the veteran anchor spent the latter part of his career promoting streams of misinformation and conspiracy theories on behalf of the then-president. Trump regularly praised Dobbs in return, often posting clips of his show on his social media channels. Trump on Thursday praised Dobbs as a friend and \u201ctruly incredible journalist, reporter, and talent.\u201d \u201cHe understood the World, and what was \u2018happening,\u2019 better than others,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media platform. \u201cLou was unique in so many ways, and loved our Country. Our warmest condolences to his wonderful wife, Debi, and family. He will be greatly missed!\u201d After the 2020 election, Dobbs used his Fox Business program to repeatedly promote false conspiracy theories that the vote had been rigged by shadowy companies that flipped millions of votes from Trump to Joe Biden. These on-air comments helped spur voting technology companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic to sue Fox News for defamation. Fox News settled with Dominion last year for more than $787 million. But Smartmatic\u2019s lawsuit \u2014 which also personally named Dobbs as a defendant \u2014 is still ongoing. After the lawsuits were filed, Fox Business canceled Dobbs\u2019 show, taking him off the air in an abrupt move announced on a Friday in February 2021. Lawyers representing Dobbs previously said in the Smartmatic case that he \u201cdenies the allegation of a disinformation campaign\u201d and that he \u201cengages in opinion commentary on issues of public interest, which is his right under the U.S. Constitution.\u201d Fox News on Thursday praised the veteran anchor and offered condolences to his family. \u201cWe are deeply saddened by the passing of Lou Dobbs. An incredible business mind with a gift for broadcasting, Lou helped pioneer cable news into a successful and influential industry,\u201d a Fox News Media spokesperson said. \u201cWe are immensely grateful for his many contributions and send our heartfelt condolences to his family.\u201d Marshall Cohen contributed to this story.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/media/lou-dobbs-dead/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_business_recovery-global-crowdstrike-outage", "text": "The company that caused a massive computer outage across the world says a flawed update has been rolled back \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t necessarily help the thousands of businesses that have been affected by the glitch. The CrowdStrike software issue at the heart of the outage runs at such a deep level in affected computers and systems that getting them up and running just to be fixed will be, in many cases, an enormous challenge. That\u2019s compounded by the fact that many of the servers that may contain information needed to get these systems working again are themselves caught in a cycle of crashing and rebooting. And some affected computers might not even be easily accessible, set up in remote locations and intended to run without human intervention. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s too early to call it: this will be the largest IT outage in history,\u201d said security expert Troy Hunt in a post on X. The CrowdStrike software at fault operates at what\u2019s called the kernel level of a computer, a much deeper level than what more ordinary applications such as browsers or video games do. This portion of a device has much greater visibility and control over a computer and its components, making it critical for the operation of all other systems \u2014 and far more sensitive. Running at the kernel level means CrowdStrike\u2019s software can do more to detect cyberattacks, but it also means the current bug is causing Windows computers to crash to a Blue Screen of Death before users can take any actions to correct it. The issue appears to be recoverable, CrowdStrike has said, but in many cases it requires painstaking work: Each affected device must be accessed by an administrator and manually rebooted into safe mode. Then, the offending CrowdStrike file must be deleted by hand. For businesses with hundreds or thousands of laptops, desktops and servers running CrowdStrike\u2019s security software, an individual human may have to perform that process over and over and over again. \u201cYou can\u2019t automate that,\u201d said Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher and former Microsoft threat analyst, in a post on X. \u201cSo this is going to be incredibly painful for CrowdStrike customers.\u201d On Friday, a Microsoft status page reported that some Windows Virtual Machine users have successfully recovered from the issue by repeatedly rebooting, in some situations up to 15 times in a row. \u201cWe have received feedback from customers that several reboots (as many as 15 have been reported) may be required, but overall feedback is that reboots are an effective troubleshooting step at this stage,\u201d Microsoft said on the page. The company did not speculate as to why the technique appears to work. Affected organizations can also try to restore their machines to an earlier state by reverting to a previous system backup, Microsoft added, though it acknowledged that may not be possible in all cases. \u201cCompanies that haven\u2019t invested in rapid backup solutions are stuck in a catch-22,\u201d said Eric O\u2019Neill, a cybersecurity expert and former FBI counterintelligence official. It gets worse. Organizations that take security seriously will have likely encrypted their computers\u2019 hard drives, making it even more challenging to access the file that needs to be deleted. For those organizations, \u201cyou need to manually decrypt the disk with a BitLocker Recovery Key, which is probably \u2014 for most companies \u2014 stored digitally on one of the servers that is currently booting over and over,\u201d said Ira Bailey, a security researcher, in a post on BlueSky. Every affected computer that is BitLocker-encrypted will need to be unlocked with a recovery key before organizations can begin the process of deleting the bad CrowdStrike file and restoring normal operation, said the cybersecurity expert who goes by the pseudonymous handle SwiftOnSecurity in a post on X. Recovery will be enormously expensive for Fortune 500 companies with large teams of IT staff and likely even more challenging for smaller firms, Kenn White, an independent security researcher who specializes in network security, told CNN. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have physical staff that can actually touch it, this is going to take many, many days for much of corporate America to recover from,\u201d White said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a ton of labor-intensive manual work.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly complicated procedure for non-technical people,\u201d White added, \u201cand even a lot of skilled IT professionals will find it difficult to do this at the scale that\u2019s going to be required given the number of machines that are affected.\u201d How did the CrowdStrike bug lead to such widespread effects? Because CrowdStrike\u2019s security software is running on countless individual computers all around the globe, the update that got pushed to those devices caused them all to shut down, virtually simultaneously. And in today\u2019s networked economy, an outage in one part of a supply chain can cause  domino effects up and down the line. When multiple parts of a supply chain go down, it touches off a cascade of problems. Imagine a person trying to buy a coffee, said Andrew Peck, a cybersecurity expert at Loughborough University in the UK. What may seem like a simple transaction relies on multiple computers working in tandem, from the coffee shop\u2019s point of sale to the payment processor\u2019s own back-end systems. \u201cThere are a lot of computers in this chain, and usually the larger the business, the larger the chain,\u201d Peck said. \u201cIf any one of the computers are down in the chain, the transaction will not complete.\u201d It could take millions of person-hours of work by corporate IT professionals to fix all the computers that were affected, said O\u2019Neill, the former FBI counterintelligence operative. But, he said, coming up with a firm estimate is difficult because it\u2019s unknown how many computers were affected. Imagine something like the massive aviation industry, the critical financial services sector or the life-or-death operations of a health care provider, and the scope of the disaster becomes starkly clear. With many people now working from home, he said, IT professionals can\u2019t just go desk-to-desk to fix different computers. Instead, they\u2019ll have to communicate with individual employees and talk them through the process remotely. \u201cThat magnifies the issue,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething that could have been fixed in hours is going to take days.\u201d Some affected machines may be rarely serviced by people or located in remote areas. Others may not even have monitors or keyboards plugged in, because they don\u2019t regularly require humans to directly interact with them. The most extreme examples may include weather monitoring sensors or devices in railway signal boxes, Peck said, which could require technicians to physically visit potentially hundreds of thousands of machines to perform the recovery process. Recovery will cost the world \u201cthousands of hours and millions, potentially billions of dollars,\u201d Peck said, which quickly adds up to \u201csome very exhausted IT support teams burning budget they didn\u2019t have.\u201d What is Microsoft\u2019s role in all this? A separate issue earlier, on Thursday, did lead to significant impacts on many of Microsoft\u2019s own cloud customers, but it was resolved overnight and was unrelated to the CrowdStrike issue, Microsoft and multiple cybersecurity experts told CNN. The CrowdStrike bug may have initially been conflated with the Microsoft issue because CrowdStrike\u2019s error affected only Windows machines. \u201cBoth are Microsoft-related, but Microsoft had nothing to do with the second incident,\u201d White told CNN. That appears to be supported by Microsoft\u2019s own status account on X, which on Thursday announced an issue affecting \u201cMicrosoft 365 apps and services\u201d and a separate announcement Friday addressing the CrowdStrike outage. The two issues are being tracked using different reference numbers. As of Friday morning, Microsoft said the issue with Microsoft 365 had been resolved and that the situation was improving. \u201cThe ongoing CrowdStrike issue is unrelated to a previous outage in the Central US Azure region on July 18, impacting Azure customers using that region as well as some Microsoft 365 services,\u201d Microsoft said. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella acknowledged the CrowdStrike issue in a post on X Friday morning, saying Microsoft is \u201cworking closely with CrowdStrike and across the industry to provide customers technical guidance and support to safely bring their systems back online.\u201d Since the update to CrowdStrike\u2019s software was delivered by the company\u2019s own systems, it appears unlikely that Microsoft bears direct responsibility for Friday\u2019s outages, said Beaumont, who said he reviewed a copy of CrowdStrike\u2019s flawed update. The problem with CrowdStrike\u2019s update was that it wasn\u2019t formatted correctly \u201cand causes Windows to crash every time,\u201d Beaumont posted on X.

{"id": "2024_07_19_business_disneyland-workers-strike-authorization", "text": "Cyn Carranza buffs, cleans, waxes and scrubs Disneyland floors starting at midnight, so that guests coming the next morning feel as if no one had been there before them. But after her shifts working near a sparkling Sleeping Beauty Castle, she went \u201chome\u201d to a car, for about four months last year, because her wages, plus earnings at two other jobs, weren\u2019t enough to afford renting a place with a bed. Now, negotiating better wages and working conditions for Carranza and thousands of other Disneyland employees has gotten messy, to the point where 9,500 of them\u00a0will conclude a vote on Friday that will authorize a potential strike. If the vote passes, as it is virtually certain to do, it\u2019s then up to union leadership to decide whether to hold one. It would be the first at Disney\u2019s original resort in 40 years. Disneyland officials said that there are plans in place that would allow the parks to continue operating with the same expected level of service, in the event of a strike. Union leaders said if the strike happens, it would likely be of limited duration, unlike open-ended strikes by actors\u2019 and writers\u2019 unions that halted film and TV productions at Disney and other media and tech companies for much of 2023. Strike authorization votes are common, and they typically pass by overwhelming margins. But that does not mean a strike will necessarily happen, as was the case with Teamsters at UPS last year. While this potential strike would officially be about Disney not allowing union buttons to be worn at work, the\u00a0underlying concern among rank-and-file workers is about the current contract that many say does not provide a livable wage. A dream of affordability Carranza \u2018s Disneyland wage is just over $20 per hour, after factoring in a differential for working the overnight shift. Her work is laborious, often dragging 600 feet of PVC hose and working with heavy machinery to buff the floors. \u201cIt\u2019s upsetting that the balloons that we sell in the park are more expensive than [what] I\u2019m making an hour. I have to work an hour and a half if I want to afford one of those Disney balloons,\u201d Carranza said. As of April 1, California\u2019s minimum wage for fast food workers is $20 per hour, which has affected other industries competing for the same workers. Voters in the city of Anaheim in Orange County, CA, where the Disneyland Resort is located, had previously approved a measure that required the resort\u2019s employees to make a $19.90 minimum wage as of January of 2024. But in a county where the 2022 median rent was $2,251 a month, and where about 10% of residents live in poverty, workers said a wage of about $20 an hour is still not enough. After Carranza lived in a car, she moved into a hotel because she could not afford a security deposit or first and last months\u2019 rent for an apartment. Today, she shares an apartment with a roommate. Change at the Disneyland Resort \u2013 and in affordability in Southern California in general \u2013 has been deeply troubling for Coleen Palmer, who has seen been at Disneyland Resort for 37 years. When she first started, Palmer says she was able to rent a $400 a month two-bedroom apartment by herself on the around $650 per month wages she earned. Today, she\u00a0rents a one-bedroom apartment for just a little over $2000 a month, and limits the groceries she buys on the $2800 she says she takes home every month. Then there\u2019s utilities, food, a phone bill, medical care, and other fixed costs. She doesn\u2019t travel anywhere besides work in order to save on gas, and buys items like chicken that can be shared with her dog. \u201cIt does feel very defeating at times. It makes me question my self-worth. And there are times when I think to myself, is it worth it? Should I go somewhere else? But I am a few years away from retirement,\u201d Palmer said. She said she wants to stick it out, especially because she loves the job. She loves talking to kids about what they\u2019ve been doing around the park and telling them they\u2019ve been brave to try the thrill rides. Palmer is happy to see the lowest wage earners get an increase due to the city\u2019s minimum wage laws. But those earning slightly more, with decades of experience, did not get a raise. Palmer said she makes just under $24 an hour after nearly four decades, while an entry-level employee makes $19.90 an hour. Disneyland officials said wages are up more than 40% in the last five years. But much of that increase has followed changes in the state and local minimum wage. Escaping reality, not confronting it A strike would involve about 9,500 employees who work at Disneyland Park, currently under a contract that expired in June. Another 4,500 employees in the same bargaining group work at the Downtown Disney retail and dining district, the Disney hotels, or the resort\u2019s other theme park, Disney California Adventure. Their contract expires in September, and they are not part of the current strike developments. Together, they represent about 40% of the entire resort\u2019s employees. But only the Disneyland Park employees will vote and participate in a strike for now. The unions and Disneyland have two more meetings scheduled on Monday and Tuesday. These groups do not include the character and parade performers who organized in May as part of Actors\u2019 Equity Association and have yet to start their bargaining process. Officially, this potential strike would be over union buttons depicting a raised Mickey fist. SEIU-USWW, Teamsters Local 495, UCFW Local 324 and BCTGM Local 83 filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board against Disney in June for what they say are hundreds of instances of unlawful discipline, intimidation and surveillance of union members wearing these buttons at work. The NLRB is expected to investigate the charges over the next few months, after which a regional NLRB director could decide if the case merits a hearing. Disneyland officials told CNN the wearing of union buttons goes against the parks\u2019 uniform policy and that only a \u201chandful\u201d of employees have been disciplined. Disneyland officials said in a statement that the parks strive to give guests \u201can uninterrupted,\u202fimmersive experience,\u201d and that \u201canything that distracts from the\u202fshow or story, be it a\u202fnon-approved\u202fbutton, pin or sticker worn by a cast member, would be addressed by a leader.\u201d The term \u201ccast member\u201d refers to any Disney employee, as the company treats any experience in front of a guest as a performance. Every employee works toward creating a space where guests escape reality and suspend disbelief, to feel as if they are truly on a Star Wars planet, for example. For the same reason, cast members are not allowed to refer to humans underneath character costumes, because this would break the fa\u00e7ade. Disney\u2019s policy is that a leader would ask the employee to remove the union button to maintain the integrity of the \u201cshow.\u201d Only\u202frepeated violations\u202fwould warrant any\u202fdisciplinary\u202faction, starting with a verbal warning.

{"id": "2024_06_12_success_saving-under-high-interest-rates", "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is an updated version of an article that originally ran on May 1. As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged for its seventh meeting in a row on Wednesday. People carrying variable-rate debt like credit cards and those seeking a loan won\u2019t be happy given that the Fed\u2019s rate, which directly and indirectly affects consumers\u2019 borrowing costs, remains at a 23-year high. Those rates will likely stay high for a while. At this point, only one cut is seen as likely before the end of the year, according to US central bankers\u2019 latest summary of economic projections. But whenever the cuts start, they may be small. \u201cAbsent a complete about-face from the economy, interest rates aren\u2019t likely to come down soon enough, or fast enough, to provide meaningful relief to borrowers. Utilize zero-percent credit card balance transfer offers, shop around for lower fixed-rate personal loans and home equity loans, and channel as much income as possible toward paying down this debt as quickly as possible,\u201d said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com\u2019s chief financial analyst. But the Fed\u2019s decision leaves savers, once again, in the catbird seat when it comes to making money on their money. \u201cSavers are enjoying the best returns on savings accounts and CDs in more than 15 years, with the most competitive offers outpacing inflation. In addition, these conditions are poised to persist for the foreseeable future,\u201d McBride said. Online high-yield savings accounts The best bang for your savings can still be had in online high-yield savings accounts at FDIC-insured banks, which yield way more than today\u2019s 0.58% overall average savings rate. As of June 11, the average online savings account rate was 4.40%, according to DepositAccounts.com. And many online high-yield accounts continue to offer rates of 5% or more. Say you have $10,000 in savings. If you leave it parked in a regular savings account at 0.5%, you\u2019ll get $50 in interest for a year. If you put it instead in a 5% high-yield account, you\u2019ll get $500. A high-yield savings account is the best place to park money you\u2019ll need to cover emergencies as well as anticipated large expenses that you have to pay in the next three months to a year. As with any savings account, banks can lower the rate they offer \u2014 also known as the APY \u2014 at any time. And you can be sure they will do just that when the Fed looks like it will finally start cutting rates, McBride said. But, he added, since rates are likely to be cut in small increments, online high-yield savings accounts may continue to offer inflation-beating returns for some time. \u201cThey will still offer the best way to preserve your [money\u2019s] buying power,\u201d McBride said. Money market accounts and money market funds Money market deposit accounts and money market mutual funds are generating yields competitive with the best high-yield savings accounts. But there are important differences. Money market deposit accounts are bank products. So, assuming your bank is FDIC insured, your account is too. (Or, if your account is at a federally backed credit union, your money will be\u00a0insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.) As with high-yield accounts, you may get the best deals at an online bank. But money market accounts may have a higher minimum deposit requirement than a high-yield account. Money market funds, by contrast, are an investment product \u2014 they generate return by investing in short-term, low-risk debt instruments and are currently yielding an average of 5.12%, according to the Crane 100 Money Fund Index. Such funds are a good place to park cash you have in your brokerage account that you may want to use at some point to buy equities or bonds, McBride said. Money market funds are not FDIC-insured, but any brokerage you use should be insured by the\u00a0Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which\u00a0covers your funds up to a limit if your brokerage ever goes under. Certificates of deposit CDs are still a great place to park any money you can leave untouched for a fixed\u00a0period of time \u2014 anywhere from a few months to five years or longer. As of June 11, the average rate was 4.971% on an online one-year CD, and 3.815% on a five-year CD, according to DepositAccounts.com. While your brick-and-mortar bank may offer a CD at a good rate, you may get a better one shopping around. The easiest way to do that without having to set up an additional account at another bank is to shop for CDs through your online brokerage, which is likely to offer a wide array of CDs from many different banks. At Schwab.com, for instance, CDs on offer ranging in duration from three months all the way up to 10 years offered average annual returns over 5%, with most ranging between 5.30% and 5.45%. The highest annual average was 5.56% for a three-month CD. If you have to withdraw money before the end of a CD\u2019s term, you can always get all of your principal back but may forfeit some of the interest earned as an early withdrawal penalty. Treasury bills and notes Beyond deposit accounts, investing in short-term Treasury bills and intermediate-term Treasury notes has been another way to earn a competitive return with virtually no risk since Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Treasury bills come in six different maturities: 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 13 weeks, 17 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks. Treasury notes mature in two, three, five, seven or 10 years. \u201cAs long as the Fed holds its rate in the 5.25% to 5.5% range, we expect most Treasury bill yields to hover around 5.25% as well,\u201d said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. But, Martin added, \u201cWhile the timing of rate cuts has been pushed back, we still expect them to arrive later this year, and investors in short-term investments would likely face reinvestment risk.\u201d That\u2019s why he suggests investors consider buying some intermediate-term investments now before rates are cut if they want to lock in a higher yield for some of their money, such as Treasury notes maturing in the next four to 10 years. On Wednesday, yields on Treasury bills were north of 5% and yields on Treasury notes were north of 4%, according to Schwab.com. When deciding whether it makes sense to invest in a CD or a Treasury for the same duration, you might opt for the Treasury if you live in a high-tax state, McBride suggested, since interest on Treasuries is\u00a0exempt from state and local taxes.

{"id": "2024_07_02_media_biden-interview-abc-george-stephanopoulos", "text": "President Joe Biden has scheduled his first television interview following his disastrous debate with former President Trump last week that led many within Biden\u2019s own party to question whether he should be the Democratic nominee. ABC will air parts of George Stephanopoulos\u2019 interview with Biden on Friday at 6:30 p.m. ET on \u201cWorld News Tonight with David Muir.\u201d The extended interview will air Sunday on \u201cThis Week with George Stephanopoulos.\u201d At last week\u2019s debate, hosted by CNN, Biden struggled to complete sentences at times and often looked lost as Trump pumped out falsehoods, urgently raising questions about Biden\u2019s age and ability to serve a second term. The interview is a major get for ABC News and an important moment for Biden, following his halting debate performance. Although Biden has made several public appearances since the debate, he has read prepared remarks at those events. This will be his first off-the-cuff appearance since the debate. Several White House allies have publicly and privately called for Biden to immediately hold some sort of live interview or press conference to help assuage fears over the president\u2019s acuity. ABC did not immediately respond a request for comment about whether it plans to publish the full unedited version of the interview. Due to timing constraints, networks usually edit down interviews for shows. Biden\u2019s last major interview was with David Muir in Normandy last month. He previously spoke to CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on May 8 and with Time magazine\u2019s Massimo Calabresi on May 28. The ABC interview will be his fourth major television interview of 2024, according to a CNN tally. Biden has held fewer interviews than his recent predecessors.

{"id": "2024_07_19_business_paris-olympics-2024-demand-sponsors", "text": "The brownish, once-polluted River Seine in Paris isn\u2019t the glitziest or most glamorous, especially in a city filled with iconic landmarks. But for Chase, it\u2019s hoping the waterway will be a showstopper. At the 2024 Summer Olympics, which officially starts next Friday in the French capital, the bank, along with credit card company Visa, is debuting a floating lounge exclusively for holders of its pricey Chase Sapphire Reserve card. It\u2019s just a small sliver of what companies are doing in their takeover during the two-week sporting spectacular. Paris 2024 organizers are expected to bring in about $1.3 billion in sponsorship revenue from a mix of domestic partners totaling 60 companies, like Accor and LVMH, and international partners from Coca-Cola to Omega watches. In a first, Anheuser-Bush InBev is the beer sponsor for the Olympic games with a non-alcoholic brew taking the torch. On the Sapphire\u2019s lounge on the Seine, guests will be treated to fine French food, live entertainment including DJs and bands and a one-of-kind view of Paris meant to strike envy among their Instagram followers. That\u2019s all by design to promote the exclusivity the card offers and perhaps its most lavish attempt at expanding its swanky lounge concept, most commonly seen at airports. The games are \u201cobviously, a huge cultural moment\u201d with a captivated audience, according to Sam Palmer, general manager of Chase\u00a0Sapphire, a popular Visa credit card that attracts high-end spenders with fancy perks, like the lounge, to offset the $550 annual fee. \u201cIt\u2019s is very much aligned with what Sapphire Reserve card members love,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cIf you think about the Olympics \u2026 it\u2019s about travel, dining, culture, excitement, community.\u201d All of those things meet every four years at the Olympics, which brings together millions of fans and thousands of athletes. Paris, a city known for its opulence, plays host this year to the first post-Covid games without any crowd restrictions for the first time in six years. (Both the summer games in Tokyo 2021 and 2022 winter games in Beijing either barred or limited spectators or visitors.) LVMH, the French luxury brand, reportedly spent $160 million to be the games\u2019 first-ever \u201ccreative partner\u201d with all of its brands\u2019 reach seen throughout. Louis Vuitton has designed the trays that the medals will be presented on, leather maker Berluti crafted the French athletes\u2019 uniforms at the opening ceremonies and Mo\u00ebt & Chandon champagne will be flowing at events and at a pop-up restaurant with celebrated chef Yannick Allen. Tepid travel Despite the excitement from companies, it\u2019s the fans that are, so far, more muted. Although the city is expected to draw 11.3 million visitors, only 10% of that are expected to come from outside of France, according to the city\u2019s tourism department. Even hotels and airlines, which often cash in with a financial boon from major events (see: Taylor Swift), are, so far, underwhelmed by the games with fears of crowds, political turmoil and high prices turning off visitors. BlackTomato, a luxury travel company, has seen its number of bookings have \u201ceased slightly\u201d for Paris this summer \u2014 declining 15% compared to 2023 \u2014 showing that excitement to visit the city has dampened during the games. \u201cWe have taken significant bookings to Paris for those who are attending Olympic events, but for those who are not attending the actual games, there has been some hesitancy around traveling at a time when higher rates and minimum stays abound,\u201d Carolyn Addison, head of product for\u00a0BlackTomato, told CNN. She points out that travelers are opting for other parts of France, like Provence and Nice, over Paris. Occupancy rates at Paris hotels are around 80%, according to CoStar, a global provider of travel data, which is well below the nearly 90% London 2012 games had and the whopping 94% occupancy rate for the 2016 edition in Rio de Janeiro. Accor, which owns several brands spanning from the budget-minded Ibis to the upscale Raffles, is far from sold out across its 200 hotels in the city: The company told CNN that it has an occupancy rate of 75% during the games with those numbers expected to climb to between 80% and 85% once they start. Another metric showing hesitancy among travelers are flight bookings: The number is expected to increase just 10% for the games, which stretch from July 26 to August 11, according to travel firm ForwardKeys. That\u2019s down sharply from Rio, which saw a 115% increase in flight bookings. Even the most recent summer games, held in 2021 Tokyo and that barred spectators at the events, registered a 20% increase. Games held during an off-peak season such as Rio\u2019s games, during winter in the Southern Hemisphere, boosted visitors more than games held when tourism is already at a fever pitch, according to a ForwardKeys spokesperson. Some of the world\u2019s biggest airlines are warning about a huge financial loss. Delta Air Lines, a sponsor of Team USA, revealed it\u2019s going to lose about $100 million because of travelers skipping Paris. Air France, an \u201cofficial partner\u201d of the games, said in a recent release that traffic to the city is \u201clagging behind other major European cities\u201d and it\u2019s taking a roughly $200 million hit for the summer with people opting to visit or connect elsewhere. A first for the games Despite the games not being a draw for some, millions of people are still coming and experiencing the delight of Paris for one of the world\u2019s most unique events \u2014 and this year, Olympic organizers hope buying tickets is less painful than in the past as they hope to bring in $1.5 billion in sales. On Location, an event management company, is now tasked with selling tickets and hospitality suites for visitors on a single website, a departure from previous games when a number of authorized resellers in different countries sold tickets and travel packages. There\u2019s more than 300 events\u00a0in 32 sports across several cities in France and even one event, surfing, which is thousands of miles away in the French semi-autonomous territory of Tahiti. That\u2019s confusing and complicated for visitors to plan a trip around, according to Paul Caine, president of On Location. \u201cWith any event, it\u2019s typically very straightforward because they\u2019re generally one-venue events or one-day events, so it\u2019s very clear with a single type of sport. But when you get to the Olympics, it\u2019s a much more complex offering,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThis is the most ambitious hospitality offering that Paris has organized, meaning that they  really wanted to broaden out as a host city so that people had really the full breadth of what Paris has to offer,\u201d Caine said. \u201cIt\u2019s really not like what you\u2019ve seen in games before.\u201d Prices range from about $175 to see golf, which includes lounge access that serves up fresh food and alcohol, to $4,000 package that includes prime viewing of the opening ceremonies on the River Seine. During the two weeks, On Location is crafting 210 different menus and 3,815 dishes made from 80 chefs that have a collective 23 Michelin stars. The wine selection, which consists of 10 options, are of course all French. And there will be lots of macarons \u2014 200,000 to be exact \u2014 and 3.5 tons of fresh cheese plus 4.6 tons of fresh fruit. Some events have sold out, but there\u2019s still availability for many others, like tennis at Roland Garros and fencing set at the newly remodeled exhibition hall Grand Palais. Caine said there\u2019s \u201cstrong demand\u201d and organizers are seeing a \u201cwide range\u201d of visitors of various ages from around the world buying the luxe packages, including families, solo travelers and businesses looking to entertain their best clients. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of the Olympics, there isn\u2019t any one defined customer. There\u2019s a very broad swath of customers,\u201d he said. \u2018Huge cultural moment\u2019 for brands Beyond the athletes, the Olympics are a showcase for brands that have signed multimillion-dollar deals with the International Olympic Committee to become official partners of the games and the billions of eyeballs that watch them. The brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev is choosing to promote Corona Cero, a non-alcoholic brand that isn\u2019t sold in the United States. (Financial terms weren\u2019t disclosed). Corona Cero was chosen because \u201cthis is the most global brand that we have in the company, and this is a global partnership,\u201d Anheuser-Busch InBev Chief Marketing Officer\u00a0Marcel Marcondes previously said. \u201cIt only makes sense for us to go with the brand that we have the highest reach globally.\u201d In the US, viewers will see ads for Michelob Ultra, which is the \u201cexclusive beer sponsor\u201d for Team USA athletes through 2028 and will be the official beer of the LA 2028 Summer Games. Swanky events like these are how Sapphire \u201cbrings more value and elevate the lifestyle and the things that matter to our card members,\u201d Chase\u2019s Palmer said, which didn\u2019t want to reveal the price of all its events. \u201cAnd of course, it also helps put our name out there and attract new card members, right?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/business/paris-olympics-2024-demand-sponsors/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_business_economy-trump-voters", "text": "In 2018, Jonathan and Trista Schmier felt the economy was so strong that they could take a big risk. They quit their property management jobs and opened a restaurant, Rustic Burger, in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Trista Schmier, who had long dreamed of owning a restaurant, designed the menu, which offered 20 types of burgers. The couple, who are in their 40s and have two sons, had no trouble filling jobs, which paid $9 an hour to start, and food was affordable enough for them to offer a burger, side and 20-oz drink for $9.99. The following year, they opened a second location and were in the process of opening a third when the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020. In 2022, the Schmiers felt the economy was so troubled that they had to shutter the restaurants and go back to property management. It was hard to find reliable workers, and they couldn\u2019t afford to pay $14 an hour to compete with applicants\u2019 other offers. Food prices had skyrocketed \u2014 chicken wings cost $93 a case, up from $40; buns were 87 cents each, up from 33 cents; and Angus beef was $1.66 a patty, up from $1.08. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t keep raising our prices,\u201d said Jonathan Schmier, who received backlash when they began charging $10.99 for the burger, side and drink. \u201cThe customers got very, very upset.\u201d The couple are among the millions of Americans who feel the economy was stronger under former President Donald Trump and want him back in the White House so that prosperity can return. Poll after poll show that voters have more faith in Trump\u2019s ability to handle the economy than President Joe Biden\u2019s. Some 51% of registered voters said they trust Trump more to handle the economy, compared to 32% who trust Biden more, a CNN poll taken in late June found. Likewise, a Pew Research Center poll released in mid-July found that 54% of registered voters are at least somewhat confident in Trump\u2019s ability to make good decisions about the economy, versus 40% who feel that way about Biden. Americans have the same view on the economy now as they did during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic, said Carroll Doherty, Pew\u2019s director of political research. Some 23% of the public said they thought the economy was \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d in April 2020, when most of the nation was under lockdown and millions had lost their jobs, and this past May, when inflation was the top problem. By contrast, some 57% of folks felt that way about the economy in January 2020, which Doherty said was more positive than at any point in the previous two decades. Good economy Trump presided over a strong economy \u2026 at least until the Covid-19 pandemic hit in March 2020, causing the job and stock markets to crater. When Trump entered office in 2017, he inherited and continued what would be the longest employment expansion on record. From Trump\u2019s inauguration in 2017 through February 2020, an average of 181,500 jobs were added on a monthly basis. The unemployment rate hovered around 50-year lows of 3.5% in the months just before the pandemic began, and the rate for Black Americans hit a record low of 5.3% during his administration. (However, that rate went even lower during the Biden administration and hit 4.8% in April 2023.) Before the pandemic, median household income saw the biggest spike in more than four decades \u2014 hitting a record high of $68,700 in 2019, according to the US Census Bureau. The poverty rate fell to 10.5%, the lowest since records started six decades earlier. Trump\u2019s presidency also included the continuation of the longest bull market in history, which began shortly after former President Barack Obama entered office. By many measures, however, the economy under Biden \u2014 who took office while the pandemic was still underway \u2014 has also been strong. The resilience of the US labor market during the past two years has exceeded the early part of Trump\u2019s presidency. Until May, the unemployment rate held under 4% for 27 months, matching a streak last seen in the late 1960s. Meanwhile, the employment rate of women in their prime working years ticked up to a new all-time high of 78.1% in May. But for people \u2014 especially for those who have jobs and were not recently unemployed \u2014 there\u2019s more to the economy than a strong labor market, said Bernard Yaros, lead US economist for Oxford Economics. \u201cThis is where inflation really matters a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat has really colored households\u2019 perceptions about the economy has been inflation.\u201d Prices may not be rising as quickly as they have been \u2014 the latest Consumer Price Index showed annual inflation at 3%, matching the lowest rate of increase seen in three years \u2013 but that might not bring much solace to American households. The overall CPI index is a good 20% higher than it was in February 2020. (In recent history, for a comparable 54-month period, that increase would be around 10%, BLS data shows.) The sharpest rise in prices since the early 1980s also ate away at Americans\u2019 paychecks for many months on end. That was a sharp turnabout from the early years of the Trump administration, when take-home pay was steadily climbing. (Technically, Trump\u2019s four years did see the highest real wage growth since former President Jimmy Carter was in office; however, it was due to the massive loss of 21 million jobs, the majority being in lower-paying industries and lifting average pay data as a result.) \u201cPeople aren\u2019t economists, they don\u2019t think like economists, they don\u2019t look at the rate of change in consumer prices \u2026 they\u2019re looking at how much a dozen eggs cost now compared to two years ago,\u201d Yaros told CNN. \u201cThis is really where I think Biden has gotten dinged by, in terms of his public image of his handling of the economy.\u201d Inflation is expected to weigh on the psychology of the swing voter, Yaros wrote in a research briefing earlier this year modeling out the upcoming election. Yaros and colleagues found that if voters in swing states focus on the cumulative increase in the level of prices since Biden\u2019s inauguration, Trump is expected to win; however, if they focus on the year-over-year change in prices or their inflation-adjusted incomes, Biden is poised to win. Inflation hurts Although Ted Southworth considers his financial situation to be \u201ccomfortable,\u201d inflation has still had a big impact on his and his wife\u2019s lifestyle. Among the changes: They have fewer steak nights at their Burlington, North Carolina, home and eat out less frequently at higher-end restaurants. They are keeping their SUV when the lease expires, instead of getting a new car. Southworth, who retired 15 years ago from his job as director of corporate purchasing at a truck manufacturer, is concerned that prices could continue to rise. \u201cI trust the other guy better,\u201d said Southworth, 74, referring to Trump, whom he voted for in 2016 and 2020. \u201cDuring Trump\u2019s term, there was very little inflation. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got inflation under control yet.\u201d Becky Cantrell, who lives in Land O\u2019 Lakes, Florida, feels the price hikes whenever she goes to the supermarket. Recently, she decided to stop buying mayonnaise because it now costs $7.88, compared to $5 a few years ago. And, she pointed out, Dollar Tree ended $1 prices after 35 years and raised most items at stores to $1.25 in late 2021. Cantrell, whose husband died in November 2020, had trouble finding a job that paid enough to afford the swiftly rising prices, forcing her to work two jobs and take in a friend as a roommate. Finally, in March, she landed a human resources position at a health provider that gives her some \u201cbreathing room.\u201d But she still plans to vote for Trump in November. \u201cEverything was just more affordable before Biden became president,\u201d said Cantrell, 59, the mother of two adult sons.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/business/economy-trump-voters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_tech_meta-eu-competition-rules", "text": "Facebook parent Meta has been accused of breaking Europe\u2019s new digital competition rules over its \u201cpay or consent\u201d advertising model. Late last year, Meta (META)\u00a0launched\u00a0a service called \u201cSubscription for no ads,\u201d allowing European users of Facebook and Instagram to pay up to \u20ac12.99 ($14) a month for ad-free versions. The alternative is to accept versions with personalized ads. The European Commission said in a statement Monday that, in its preliminary view, \u201cthis binary choice forces users to consent to the (use) of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalized but equivalent version of Meta\u2019s social networks.\u201d If the provisional findings of the Commission\u2019s investigation are confirmed, the EU could hit Meta with a fine equivalent to 10% of its global annual revenue under its landmark Digital Markets Act. Based on the company\u2019s 2023 results, that would amount to $13.5 billion. Meta said it didn\u2019t accept the Commission\u2019s findings. \u201c\u2019Subscription for no ads\u2019 follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. \u201cWe look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.\u201d The EU announcement comes a week after the Commission accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the DMA by preventing app developers from freely directing consumers to cheaper services. The regulators are also investigating Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) under the new law. The DMA, which came into force in March, requires dominant online platforms \u2014 so-called gatekeepers \u2014 to give users more choice, and rivals more opportunities to compete. Online platforms often collect personal data across their own and third-party services and use it in digital advertising services. Margrethe Vestager, a European Commissioner in charge of competition policy, noted in Monday\u2019s statement that Meta had been accumulating personal data of \u201cmillions of EU citizens over many years.\u201d \u201cWe want to empower citizens to be able to take control over their own data and choose a less personalized ads experience,\u201d she said. Michael Koenig, a senior official at the Commission, said Meta must offer users an alternative to \u201cfull\u201d ad personalization that \u201cdoes not rely on this personal data and which is then automatically less personalized and still available to them.\u201d \u201cThen Meta is free to keep a third option, which is a subscription not to see ads at all, or a fourth option which may have some premium features,\u201d he told journalists. The Commission is due to conclude its probe into Meta by late March next year.

{"id": "2024_06_17_success_how-to-find-good-affordable-colleges", "text": "Long before you take your high schooler on college campus tours, consider this: Shopping for college shouldn\u2019t be any different than shopping for a home.\u00a0When you want to buy a home, you come up with a range of how much you can afford and get pre-qualified for a mortgage. Then you look in neighborhoods that offer homes that meet your family\u2019s needs and fall within your price range. \u201cAdopt a mindset that we\u2019re buying college like we\u2019re buying a house,\u201d said Beth Walker, author of \u201cBuying College Better\u201d and \u201cNever Pay Retail for College.\u201d As a financial adviser and certified\u00a0college planning specialist, Walker tries to help families avoid a situation that many find themselves in at the 11th hour: Their child applies \u2014 and gets into \u2014 schools they cannot afford because the schools won\u2019t give them enough aid. And then they just \u2026 try to make it work, no matter how much debt is involved for the parents or the student. Instead, she advises families to start as early as 9th or 10th grade in figuring out what is affordable for them as a family \u2014 so parents don\u2019t sacrifice their own financial welfare and the future college student doesn\u2019t drown in debt upon graduation. And second, she recommends assessing how a child\u2019s talents and interests pare with majors and careers they might want to pursue. Doing both those things can help you target the right colleges to apply to. Mike McKinnon, executive director of the National Institute of Certified College Planners, defines the perfect college as one \u201cwhere a student can go be happy, safe and successful, graduate in four years or less with a marketable degree and little or no debt.\u201d In helping families align parents\u2019 affordability constraints with their student\u2019s academic and social needs, he cautions them not to automatically assume the Ivys or other high-prestige schools will be best simply because of their status. And he stresses what success in life looks like after college and notes that an Ivy League degree isn\u2019t the only path to achieving it, especially if your child won\u2019t get much aid to attend. In fact, said Todd Fothergill, founder and CEO of Strategies for College, a lot of brand-name schools don\u2019t even offer merit-based aid, only need-based. So if you\u2019re not rich, but you make too much to qualify for need-based aid, you could find yourself having to cover the entire cost of tuition, room and board every year, which is pushing $90,000 at some US colleges. Set up financial guardrails well before the college search Fothergill created a free calculator called CostHero that lets parents assess what financial resources they will have available to pay for a child\u2019s college education. It then provides a range of affordability: At the low end is the number representing what they can pay if they don\u2019t take on debt. And at the high end is the number they can pay if they also take out an unsubsidized federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS). \u201cIf you\u2019re not in a position to write a check for $90,000 a year, put up guardrails for yourself so you don\u2019t blow up your retirement,\u201d he said. The calculator inputs let you set the amount of resources you\u2019re willing to use to pay for college from your income and savings, your child\u2019s earnings from summer jobs, any family gifts, and any federal Stafford loans your child may take. It also factors in if you qualify for the federal American Opportunity Tax Credit. That credit, for qualified educational expenses, will reduce your tax bill or increase any refund you have coming. The calculator also gives you a debt-to-income score like the kind a mortgage lender might use to assess whether you\u2019re a good credit risk. Ideally, he said, you don\u2019t want your housing costs to exceed 36% of your gross income and your total debt \u2014 including debt from housing, cars, credit cards and any parental education loans \u2014 to exceed 43%. If your DTI ratio is close to or higher than 43% that is a sign you could get yourself into trouble if you end up having any financial problems while your child is in college, Fothergill said. \u201cIf folks have a way to determine the range of affordability prior to the onset of the college search, the outcomes are a lot better.\u00a0 For example, if one knows that the range of affordability is between $30,000 [a year] with no parent debt and $50,000 with parent debt, then any college that comes in with a net cost in that range is, by definition, affordable,\u201d Fothergill said. Net cost refers to the true cost of attendance after figuring out how much aid your child may get (e.g., grants and scholarships). Figure out where your student may qualify for the most aid Generally speaking, the biggest tuition discounts go to the most academically accomplished students in an incoming class. \u201cThe student needs to be in the top 25% of those admitted,\u201d Walker said. Getting into that top 25% cohort is based on SAT or ACT scores, and having a high, unweighted GPA based on a rigorous high school curriculum. The curriculum\u2019s academic rigor can be further bolstered by taking AP courses. Since your child is more likely to make the top quartile at some schools than others, Fothergill and Walker both recommend your child focus on applying only to those schools in which they stand the best chances of being in that top group to maximize their chances for merit-based aid. Otherwise, you\u2018ll spend money to apply to guidance-counselor-recommended \u201csafety\u201d schools or \u201creach\u201d schools with no sense if those places are affordable to you should your child get in. Using reported data from admissions officers about their key criteria in admitting an incoming class and based on what more than 1,000 schools report about the qualifications they used to grant aid, Fothergill created another tool called ListHero. It gives students a score that helps gauge\u00a0how competitive their profile is\u00a0at a given school, relative to others admitted, and by extension their eligibility for tuition discounts. Right now the tool is only available to college planning professionals for a fee. But Fothergill plans to create a free mini-version for consumers to use. For parents doing their own research on test scores, GPA requirements, costs and aid, he recommends checking the Department of Education College Scorecard, the site CollegeData.com and the College Board. Other ways to reduce college costs before applying While your children are in high school they can take other steps to reduce the total cost of their education. One way is by doing well on the PSAT to qualify to compete for a National Merit Scholarship. Another is to take AP courses. If their high school doesn\u2019t offer them, there is a program called Freshman Year for Free offered by the Modern States Education Alliance. It provides free AP placement courses and pays the fee for students to take the AP tests or college-level preparation (CLEP) tests administered through the College Board. Getting the minimum AP scores a college requires to earn a college credit will lower how much you ultimately have to spend on tuition. A third option is to see if your state has a program that offers a year of free in-state community college, the credits from which can be transferred to a state university from which your child could earn their degree. Or, if you plan to go to any other college, make sure the school will accept the credits from a community college course you plan to take. No matter what steps you take, starting the research and budgeting process early can save everyone a lot of stress, debt and potential heartache in the end.

{"id": "2024_07_19_tech_tech-outage-crowdstrike-software", "text": "When computers and tech systems around the world went down Friday, snarling airports, closing Social Security offices and limiting jail operations, many people had one question: How on earth could this happen in 2024? A software update from a single cybersecurity company, US-based CrowdStrike, was the root cause of the chaos, underlining the fragility of the global economy and its dependence on computer systems to which relatively few people give a passing thought. \u201c[M]ost people believe that when the end of the world comes, it will be AI taking over some kind of nuclear power plant and shutting down electricity,\u201d Costin Raiu, a longtime cybersecurity researcher, quipped to CNN. \u201cWhile in reality, it\u2019s more likely to be some kind of a little bit of code in a botched update, causing a cascade reaction in interdependent cloud systems.\u201d Software updates are a critical function in society to keep computers protected from hackers. But the update process itself is crucial to get right and to safeguard from tampering. An inherent \u2014 and some say misplaced \u2014 trust in that process was punctured on Friday. CrowdStrike is everywhere Numerous Fortune 500 companies use CrowdStrike\u2019s cybersecurity software to detect and block hacking threats. Computers running Microsoft Windows \u2014\u00a0one of the most popular software programs in the world \u2014 crashed because of the faulty way a code update issued by CrowdStrike is interacting with Windows. CrowdStrike, a multibillion-dollar firm, has expanded its footprint around the world in its more than decade of doing business. Many more businesses and governments are now protected from cyberthreats because of this, but the dominance of a handful of firms in the anti-virus and threat-detection marketplace creates its own risks, according to experts. \u201cWe trust cybersecurity providers widely but without diversity; we\u2019ve created fragility in our technology ecosystem,\u201d Munish Walther-Puri, the former director of cyber risk for the city of New York, told CNN. \u201c\u2018Winning\u2019 in the marketplace can aggregate risk, and then we all \u2014\u00a0consumers and companies alike \u2014 bear the costs,\u201d Walther-Puri said. CNN has requested comment from CrowdStrike. How to prevent this from happening again The wide swathe of critical infrastructure providers affected by the outage is also likely to raise fresh questions among US officials and corporate executives about whether new policy tools are needed to avoid catastrophe in the future. Anne Neuberger, a senior White House tech and cybersecurity official, spoke of the \u201crisks of consolidation\u201d in the tech supply chain when asked about the IT outage on Friday. \u201cWe need to really think about our digital resilience not just in the systems we run but in the globally connected security systems, the risks of consolidation, how we deal with that consolidation and how we ensure that if an incident does occur it can be contained and we can recover quickly,\u201d Neuberger said at the Aspen Security Forum in response to a question about the IT outage. The chaotic scenario that played out Friday did not involve a malicious actor, but government officials around the world will likely be gaming out what might have been. The infamous hack of the US government using SolarWinds software in 2020, which US officials blamed on Russia, came through a tampered software update. That hack was not nearly as disruptive but another alleged Russian hack in 2017 caused billions of dollars in damage to the global economy because malicious code spread like wildfire. The CrowdStrike episode \u201cdemonstrates the serious damage that could be inflicted by a malicious adversary if they were so minded,\u201d Tobias Feakin, a former ambassador for cybersecurity and critical technology in the Australian foreign ministry, told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/tech/tech-outage-crowdstrike-software/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

NBC announced on Wednesday it will use AI software to recreate Michaels\u2019 voice to deliver daily recaps of the Summer Games for subscribers of its Peacock streaming platform, a milestone for the use of AI by a major media company. The use of an AI voice for the Olympics comes as the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, sound and text. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries, such as journalism, about how artificial intelligence can \u2013 or even should \u2013 be used. A new tool, called \u201cYour Daily Olympic Recap on Peacock,\u201d will enable 10-minute highlights packages, which can include events updates, athlete back stories and other related content personalized by subscriber preferences. The company said the highlights could be packaged in about 7 million different ways, pulled from 5,000 hours of live coverage in Paris, effectively making AI (the artificial intelligence, not the man) a significantly more efficient way to deliver personalized recaps.  \u201cWhen I was approached about this, I was skeptical but obviously curious,\u201d Michaels said in a press release. \u201cThen I saw a demonstration detailing what they had in mind.

Bettors raised their wagers that Trump will win the November election against President Joe Biden: A contract betting that Trump will win went for 68 cents on Monday, implying a 67% chance of the former president winning the election, according to election prediction market platform PredictIt. That\u2019s up from 60 cents on Friday. The price of a contract for Biden\u2019s victory cost 26 cents on Monday. The US dollar rose 0.1% on Monday as of 4 pm ET. The price of bitcoin climbed 4%.

Trump on Monday named US Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate. A Trump win in November likely means the\u00a0preservation or expansion of tax cuts\u00a0and increased tariffs. During last month\u2019s presidential debate hosted by CNN, the former president reiterated his desire to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, which would likely increase inflation and cast doubt on interest rate cuts. Morgan Stanley research estimates that an expansion of the 2017 tax cuts would boost deficits sharply. While economic growth sounds positive for the US, some investors worry that it could reaccelerate inflation. The Federal Reserve has hiked interest rates to a painful 23-year high to tame wayward inflation, driving up borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to student loans to auto payments. While the central bank has signaled one rate cut for 2024, rates have yet to budge, as policymakers look for more signs that inflation is cooling. Economic expansion runs the risk of derailing the central bank\u2019s hard-fought progress. \u201cA second\u00a0Trump\u00a0presidency would mean expansionary economic stimulus in general, lower income taxes, less regulation, and increased tariffs,\u201d wrote Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert Financial, in a Monday note. \u201cWith painful inflation still high but possibly on its way out, the economy is in a tender state in which too much growth too fast could lead to the re-igniting of 2022-like price growth spikes.\u201d As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might change slightly.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/markets/us-markets-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl", "text": "Sam Altman has agreed to return to lead OpenAI, the company said in a Tuesday post on X, just days after his surprise ouster as chief executive sparked an employee revolt that threatened to undermine what has been the leading company in the fledgling artificial intelligence industry. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman wrote that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft, which is the ChatGPT maker\u2019s biggest financial backer. The announcement appears to bring to an end days of chaos for the AI industry that included negotiations over who should lead OpenAI and how the firm should be run, as well as broader discussions about just how fast the arms race to develop AI technology should be moving. The details of Altman\u2019s firing and re-hiring remain murky. In its announcement Friday, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently \u201ccandid\u201d with the board. That ambiguous language sent the rumor mill flying. But a key factor in Altman\u2019s ouster was the presence of\u00a0tensions between Altman, who favored pushing AI development more aggressively, and members of the original OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the crisis. As of Monday morning, Nadella had announced that Altman, along with fellow OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, would be joining Microsoft to lead a new AI research division. OpenAI said it had hired former Twitch chief Emmett Shear as interim CEO. But then hundreds of OpenAI employees, nearly the company\u2019s entire staff, threatened to leave, potentially for Microsoft, if the company\u2019s board didn\u2019t resign and reinstate Altman as CEO. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it invested billions in to help bolster its ambitions in developing AI, which many in Silicon Valley think will be the most important wave of technological advancement in the coming decades. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Microsoft CEO\u00a0Satya Nadella said on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d Altman\u2019s vision to quickly roll out and commercialize AI tools also appears to have won out. Publicly, Altman has long cautioned about risks posed by AI, and he\u202fhas pledged to lawmakers and customers that he would move OpenAI forward responsibly. \u201cIs [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all to greater liberty?\u201d he said in a May Senate subcommittee hearing pressing for regulation. \u201cOr is it gonna be more like the atom bomb \u2014 huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?\u201d But inside the company, Altman had been pushing to bring products to market more quickly and to sell them for a profit. Altman announced a few weeks ago at OpenAI\u2019s first-ever developer day that the company would make tools available so anyone could create their own version of ChatGPT. OpenAI has also worked with Microsoft to roll out ChatGPT-like technology across Microsoft\u2019s products. OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive had also reportedly\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone. \u2014 CNN\u2019s Juliana Liu and Diksha Madhok contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-altman-returns-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

In a behind-closed doors meeting known as the third plenum, more than 360 members of the party\u2019s Central Committee \u2014 including the most senior political and military leaders and heads of state-owned enterprises \u2014 held talks from Monday to Thursday at a hotel in Beijing. According to a communique released Thursday, discussions at the plenum \u2014 traditionally held every five years \u2014 centered on how to deepen reforms in a wide range of areas and advance \u201cChinese-style modernization,\u201d a broad ideal for the country\u2019s development backed by Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Xi, who hosted the meeting, has laid out a longterm vision to build a more equitable, innovative, and greener economy \u2014 under the tight control of the party \u2014 by 2035. But while the communique outlined broad goals such as boosting technology self-sufficiency, improving social welfare and deepening reforms of the fiscal, taxation and financial systems, global investors were left disappointed by a lack of detail on how China would address the most pressing issues plaguing its economy \u2014 from sluggish consumer spending and a persistent property slump to a mounting debt crisis facing municipalities around the country. \u201cThere are few signs that the just concluded third plenum marks a major change in the direction of policymaking,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics, at Capital Economics on Friday. While it offered few clues on how to tackle economic difficulties, the meeting did provide further insight into a shake-up of high-level personnel over the past year. Qin Gang, China\u2019s former foreign minister who was ousted after only months in the job, was removed from the Central Committee after a \u201cresignation,\u201d but retained his Communist Party membership. By contrast, the meeting confirmed the expulsion from the party of former Defense Minister Li Shangfu, who was sacked last year and investigated for corruption, as well as two People\u2019s Liberation Army Rocket Force figures Li Yuchao and Sun Jinming. Their removal \u2013 part of a sweeping purge within the top ranks of the military \u2013 came after the committee heard a report on their \u201cgrave violations.\u201d \u2018History of paying lip service\u2019 Shortly after he came to power, Xi promised at the plenum in 2013 to give market forces a \u201cdecisive role\u201d to play in the economy. But in the years since, his government has prioritized state-owned enterprises, implemented stricter regulations and overseen a sweeping crackdown on private businesses and wealthy individuals, as part of a wider campaign to curb the \u201cexcesses of capitalism\u201d and fix \u201cincome inequality.\u201d That has rattled the private sector, causing a plunge in investment and contributing to surging unemployment. Xi\u2019s government has also strengthened its national security apparatus in the past decade, which has scrutinized more areas of the economy and targeted foreign firms in anti-espionage campaigns. The crackdowns have scared foreign investors and fed geopolitical tensions, leading to accelerated capital outflows. In the communique, officials pledged to ensure \u201csecurity,\u201d which means national security concerns could still drive policymaking, said Evans-Pritchard. They also vowed to give \u201cbetter play to the role of the market,\u201d while noting that market forces need to be better managed, and retained a previous promise to \u201cunswervingly\u201d develop the state sector. \u201cThe current leadership has a history of paying lip service to the idea of allowing greater market dynamism but failing to follow-through in practice,\u201d Evans-Pritchard said. If past sessions are a guide, a more detailed report may be released in the following days, but for now, \u201cthe plenum communique is light on specifics,\u201d Evans-Pritchard added. Long-term reform plans The third plenum names \u201chigh quality development\u201d as China\u2019s \u201ctop priority\u201d and lays out structural reforms to be completed by 2029. Beijing has been pushing for self-sufficiency in core technologies as the United States and its allies curb the exports of key products like advanced chips to China. It has also viewed technology innovation as a new growth engine that could help the economy transition from the old model fueled by infrastructure investment and debt expansion. Policymakers also pledged to \u201cimprove people\u2019s livelihoods\u201d at the plenum, which is essentially a continuation of Xi\u2019s \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d agenda. While previous leaders in post-Mao China were content to let some get rich first, Xi appears to believe the time has come to share the fruits of China\u2019s development more widely among its population, Evans-Pritchard said. \u201cThis is arguably one of the most promising parts of the reform agenda, since channeling a greater share of income to households would help to advance a much-needed rebalancing toward consumption,\u201d he said. The leadership also vowed to revamp the fiscal, taxation and financial systems, which signal their concerns about how to address the debt crises faced by local governments. Debt has piled up at China\u2019s municipal governments, after three years of pandemic controls drained their coffers and the property slump led to a sharp decline in land sales, which they rely on for income.\u00a0That poses risks to the country\u2019s banking system and economic growth. Policy advisers and market analysts have been calling on Beijing to reform its fiscal system, allowing local governments to retain more revenues and reduce their dependence on land sales.\u00a0There have also been calls for an overhaul of consumption tax to broaden local governments\u2019 source of income. But the communique gave little detail on what measures could be rolled out on those fronts. \u201cIt will be key to watch for further development over the next two to three months,\u201d said Bank of America analysts on Friday. Short-term economic goals Besides the long-term structural reform priorities, policymakers also vowed to achieve short-term economic goals, including a 5% GDP growth target for 2024. That came days after China released disappointing economic data for the second quarter of this year. GDP grew 4.7% year-on-year in the April-to-June period, marking the weakest growth since the first quarter of last year, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday. The figure slowed from 5.3% in the previous three months and missed the 5.1% increase forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. To achieve the annual goals, \u201c[we] will proactively expand domestic demand\u201d and develop \u201cnew-quality productivity forces,\u201d the communique said. That could mean channeling resources to favored sectors, such as high-tech manufacturing, while gradually curbing the role of sunset industries like property development, according to Evans-Pritchard from Capital Economics. Analysts say that the coming months could offer more details on how Xi plans to revive the economy. Emphasizing short-term economic policies is rare in the history of the third plenums, said Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group. As a result, policy stance could turn more expansionary in the second half of this year as policymakers have to defend the annual growth target, he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/business/china-plenum-economy-downturn-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

And how should other institutions \u2013 governments, non-tech industries, global alliances, regulatory bodies \u2013 reign in the worst excesses of potentially dangerous AI innovators? OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, with an explicit mission to harness what may soon be superhuman intelligence \u201cto benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d But that sensibility hasn\u2019t lasted. The company now has a multi-billion-dollar for-profit arm. They have been developing new technologies at lightning speed, and sometimes sending them out to the public\u00a0before some employees believed they were ready. The company has already reportedly invented an AI technology so dangerous they will never release it \u2013 but they also\u00a0won\u2019t tell\u00a0reporters or the public exactly what it is. This dynamic \u2013 a potentially dangerous technology developed at extreme speed, largely behind closed doors \u2013 is partly to blame for Altman\u2019s firing. The OpenAI board, according to\u00a0CNN\u2019s David Goldman, worried that \u201cthe company was making the technological equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and its caretaker, Sam Altman, was moving so fast that he risked a global catastrophe.\u201d At particular issue seemed to be Altman\u2019s efforts to make the tools behind ChatGPT available to anyone who wanted to make their own version of the chatbot. This could be widely disastrous, some board members worried. But then they fired him without warning, and apparently without involving Microsoft, the company\u2019s largest shareholder. Now, Altman is at the new AI group at Microsoft, and one has to wonder if the oversight and caution there will be on par with that at OpenAI, or if he\u2019ll be handed carte blanche to push as fast and hard as he wants. And for all the justified reticence of the OpenAI board, the company has carried out much of its work in secrecy \u2013 without the public really understanding what a handful of unaccountable technologists are building, and how it is nearly guaranteed to indelibly change their lives. AI is broadly understood to have the potential to reshape vast swaths of human existence. At the very least, it seems nearly guaranteed to change how we process information, how we communicate, how we learn and how we work (and if we work). And the ramifications could be much more extreme. AI technologies have already demonstrated the ability\u00a0to lie and to cover their tracks. They have already been able to\u00a0suggest the design\u00a0to make a virus spread more quickly. Many researchers\u00a0acutely understand\u00a0just how quickly these machines could develop the capacity to annihilate us, including Altman: He has a prepper\u2019s paradise prepared in Big Sur, complete with guns and \u201cgas masks from the Israeli Defense Force\u201d in case AI goes off the rails and the robots go to war against humans,\u00a0according to reporting in the New Yorker. But don\u2019t worry, he told an Atlantic reporter: If AI is determined to wipe us out, \u201cno gas mask is helping anyone.\u201d (If you want an excellent and terrifying rundown of AI\u2019s risks \u2013 at least those we understand right now, which are almost certainly a mere sliver of the looming perils \u2013\u00a0the Atlantic profile of Altman and his technology\u00a0is worth a read). AI is very exciting technology. But it is also a potentially very dangerous one, and not in the social media sense of \u201cit may give us bad self-esteem and make us lonelier\u201d but in the sense of \u201cit could break down human societies and kill us all.\u201d Given the life-altering potential of AI \u2013 that even if it doesn\u2019t kill us all, it will almost certainly change human existence in unprecedented ways at unprecedented speed \u2013 we all have a stake in how it\u2019s being developed. And yet the development is being left to a handful of people (who seem to be\u00a0largely\u00a0men) in Silicon Valley, and other tech pockets around the globe. And we all have a stake in whose interests AI will serve \u2013 and right now, its development is being funded with billions of dollars by people expecting to make a huge profit. Do the interests of the public align with the interests of the shareholders to whom profit-driven, potentially tremendously lucrative-for-a-few companies are beholden? Or with the interests of tech entrepreneurs who are primarily excited about being at the forefront of the AI revolution, regardless of the potential human costs? One thing is clear: AI is coming. And how it is built and unleashed on the public matters more than perhaps any technology of the past century. It is, indeed, up there with the atom bomb in its destructive potential \u2013 except likely more difficult to regulate and control. \u201cRegulation\u201d does not begin to scratch the surface of what\u2019s needed to make sure that the AI future is not a catastrophic one, especially since the development of AI is now a massive international arms race, with particularly horrific implications if bad actors develop this technology first. But regulation is, at minimum, a necessary step. So is transparency: In the US, companies have wide leverage to work behind a veil of secrecy, and much of what AI companies do is kept secret to stymy competition. But the public certainly has a right to understand what life-altering technologies are set to be inflicted upon us, and what the creators are doing to protect humanity \u2013 our jobs, our communities, our families, our connections, our educations and our abilities to build a life of purpose, but also our lives and our safety. The Altman story is fascinating because Altman is the most powerful figure in AI technology, which in effect makes him one of the most powerful men in the world. But that should give us pause: Who is he, what power does he hold, what is he doing with it, who does he answer to, and are we comfortable with this much life-altering potential being held by a few unaccountable people?", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/21/opinions/sam-altman-openai-ouster-danger-filipovic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_03_01_tech_aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl", "text": "A London-based technology company is looking to \u201cdemocratize\u201d talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. \u201cWe\u2019re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts\u2019] time,\u201d said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. \u201cTo say [to scouts], \u2018Go over to this place today because there\u2019s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the best use of your time.\u2019\u201d It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract\u00a0with EPL team Bournemouth\u00a0in 2021. \u2018It\u2019s more about evolution\u2019 Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app \u2014 which fully launched in September 2023 \u2014 according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for \u201ctier one\u201d sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including\u00a0AI commentary tools and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at\u00a0$2.7 billion\u00a0in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. \u201cIt\u2019s more about evolution than revolution,\u201d Felton-Thomas explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell you when that player\u2019s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he\u2019s 2-0 down? What happens when someone\u2019s shouting at him? What happens when he\u2019s just made a massive mistake?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you\u2019re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.\u201d While football remains ai.io\u2019s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. \u201cYou think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,\u201d Felton-Thomas told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/03/01/tech/aiscout-app-soccer-scouting-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

In the lawsuit, filed Sunday in New York state court, the president\u2019s sonaccuses Fox News of unjust enrichment, intentionally inflicting emotional distress, and violating New York civil rights laws. The lawsuit makes good on\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s threat he made in April that he would take the network to court if it didn\u2019t immediately issue retractions and corrections. The miniseries, \u201cThe Trial of Hunter Biden,\u201d was a six-part offering on the Fox Nation digital streaming network, and was also promoted on Fox News, the cable TV channel. It featured a dramatized \u201cmock trial\u201d about Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas financial dealings that led in part to his federal tax indictment and that also fueled House Republicans\u2019 struggling impeachment inquiry into his father. Fox News\u00a0took down the miniseries\u00a0in late April, one day after Hunter Biden threatened to file a lawsuit. But according to the lawsuit, promotional materials for the miniseries are still on some Fox News-linked social media pages, and the miniseries episodes are still circulating \u201conline and in the public domain.\u201d A Fox News spokesperson claimed the lawsuit was meritless and \u201centirely politically motivated,\u201d and said the network looks forward to \u201cvindicating our rights in court.\u201d \u201cThe core complaint stems from a 2022 streaming program that Mr. Biden did not complain about until sending a letter in late April 2024,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe program was removed within days of the letter, in an abundance of caution, but Hunter Biden is a public figure who has been the subject of multiple investigations and is now a convicted felon. Consistent with the First Amendment, Fox News has accurately covered the newsworthy events of Mr. Biden\u2019s own making.\u201d The new lawsuit claims Fox News \u201ctargeted Mr. (Hunter) Biden in an effort to harass, annoy, alarm, and humiliate him, and tarnish his reputation.\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s son is seeking an unspecified amount of punitive damages, as well as any profits that Fox reaped from the miniseries, and other corrective measures. \u201cThe miniseries is fictionalized; it is not a news event. It was made for the purpose of trade and advertising, and merely exploits Mr. Biden\u2019s name, image, and likeness for Fox\u2019s commercial benefit,\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers wrote in the lawsuit. Hunter Biden\u2019s team said in the lawsuit that without his consent, Fox News \u201cunlawfully published numerous intimate images (both still and video) of Mr. Biden depicting him in the nude, depicting an unclothed or exposed intimate part of him, as well as engaged in sex acts.\u201d The right-wing network said these images originated form Hunter Biden\u2019s\u00a0infamous laptop\u00a0\u2013 data from which was leaked by allies for former President Donald Trump in 2020. The president\u2019s son was\u00a0convicted at a trial\u00a0last month on federal gun charges, and faces a second trial this fall on alleged tax crimes.

That\u2019s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets. A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year \u2014 the exact date has yet to be confirmed \u2014 carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon\u2019s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth. \u201cThe first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,\u201d Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation. The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia\u2019s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice. One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon ice. Images of ice \u2014 transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network \u2014 would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon. For NASA\u2019s Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable. Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund \u2014 especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated. \u201cBeing able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis \u2014 as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,\u201d said Engelund. \u201cEventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.\u201d It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth\u2019s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing \ufeffspace colonists to use smartphones that can access all the apps and services available to those back on Earth. NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy. Bell Labs was given a $14.1 million grant in 2020, and in January, Nokia was selected by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the \u201cframework for the lunar economy.\u201d \u201cA future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,\u201d Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN. \u201cThis includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.\u201d There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too. If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth \u2014 such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms. \u201cEspecially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,\u201d Klein said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/24/tech/nokia-moon-4g-network-nasa-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_success_gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy", "text": "Employees\u2019 negative daily emotions and lack of well-being can ultimately hurt worker engagement \u2013 and the economy, according to a new report released this week. Gallup, in its \u201cState of the Global Workplace,\u201d estimates that low employee engagement costs the global economy $8.9 trillion, or 9% of global GDP. The report includes findings from its latest annual World Poll, which surveyed 128,278 employees in more than 140 countries last year. That poll found that roughly 20% of workers globally reported feeling lonely, angry or sad on a daily basis. And 41% on average say they feel stress. Those most likely to say they feel lonely were younger workers (22%), employees who worked remotely full-time (25%) and those who felt most disengaged on the job (31%). While work isn\u2019t always the cause of a person\u2019s negative daily emotions, employers should still be concerned. That\u2019s because work can either improve or worsen employees\u2019 well-being. On the one hand,\u00a0the Gallup report noted,\u00a0\u201cwhen employees find their work and work relationships meaningful, employment is associated with high levels of daily enjoyment and low levels of all negative daily emotions. Notably, half of employees who are engaged at work are thriving in life overall.\u201d On the other, researchers found that being disengaged at work can negatively affect a person\u2019s wellbeing as much as \u2014 or more than \u2014 not having a job at all. \u201cEmployees who dislike their jobs tend to have high levels of daily stress and worry, as well as elevated levels of all other negative emotions,\u201d they wrote. \u201cOn many wellbeing items (stress, anger, worry, loneliness), being actively disengaged at work is equivalent to or worse than being unemployed.\u201d Engaged managers help workers thrive The poll found that last year only 23% of employees were engaged at work, unchanged from the year prior. Gallup defines an engaged employee as someone \u201chighly involved in and enthusiastic about their work and workplace. They are psychological \u2018owners,\u2019 drive performance and innovation, and move the organization forward.\u201d But those who said they were not engaged rose by 3 percentage points to 62%. These are employees characterized as \u201cpsychologically unattached to their work and company. Because their engagement needs are not being fully met, they are putting time but not energy or passion into their work.\u201d Engagement levels are highest in so-called \u201cbest practice\u201d organizations, where three-fourths of managers on average are engaged as well as seven in 10 non-managers, Gallup said. Their best practices include leaders\u2019 emphasizing well-being at work and in life; and putting a high priority on manager hiring and development. The manager piece of the equation is especially crucial. \u201c[W]hen managers are engaged, employees are more likely to be engaged,\u201d the report said. And, it added, \u201chigh-engagement business units are likely to see significantly higher employee wellbeing \u2014 as well as higher productivity, profitability and sales \u2014 than low-engagement teams.\u201d Where the most and least stressed workers are Engagement and well-being results varied in each of the 10 regions covered by Gallup\u2019s poll. The report noted that the United States and Canada, for example, showed the highest percentage of engaged employees (33%) among all the regions studied; and the third highest percentage of thriving employees (53%), behind Australia and New Zealand (60%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (54%). But the US and Canada also ranked second among employees experiencing daily stress (49%), right behind the Middle East and North Africa (52%). By contrast, Europe showed the lowest level of employee engagement (13%). South Asia scored lowest in terms of employees described as thriving overall (13%). And countries in post-Soviet Eurasia ranked lowest in terms of daily stress (19%).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/success/gallup-workers-economy-lonely-unhappy/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_economy_biden-rent-increase-5-percent-cap-plan", "text": "President Joe Biden revealed a series of proposals aimed at lowering housing costs on Tuesday as inflation and elevated home prices are shaping up to be decisive issues for voters this year. The plan, which is subject to congressional approval, calls for withdrawing tax credits from landlords who raise rent by more than 5% per year, beginning this year and for the next two years. The plan would apply only to larger landlords who have more than 50 units in their portfolio, though that counts for more than 20 million rental units across the country, according to the White House. The policy would include an exception for new construction and buildings that are being substantially renovated. That\u2019s aimed at incentivizing new rental property construction to increase supply of apartments and homes for rent. \u201cWhile the prior administration gave special tax breaks to corporate landlords, I\u2019m working to lower housing costs for families,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cRepublicans in Congress should join Democrats to pass my plan to lower housing costs for Americans who need relief now.\u201d While overall inflation is slowing, the cost of housing remains one of the biggest hurdles for many Americans. A record-high 22.4 million renter households spent more than 30% of their income on rent and utilities in 2022, the last time the data was measured, according to a report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. That represents an increase of 2 million households over the previous three years. New inflation data released last week showed that shelter inflation rose in June at the slowest pace in three years. On an annual basis, though, housing price hikes rose 5.2%, outpacing overall inflation. According to recent polling, the issue is of high importance to voters, with 36% of Americans citing economic issues as the most important problems facing the country today, according to a June Gallup poll. Fourteen percent specifically said the high cost of living was the biggest problem in the US. It is unlikely that Congress will pass a bill containing such a proposal this close to a presidential election, though. Some federal lands could be repurposed for housing Biden announced two additional efforts aimed at reining in high housing costs on Tuesday. Several federal agencies said they would assess whether to use surplus federally owned land to build affordable homes at the urging of the Biden administration, according to the White House. For example, the Bureau of Land Management said it would open a public comment period on the sale of 20 acres of public land in Nevada at below-market value to create affordable housing, while the US Postal Service said it plans to repurpose some unused properties for housing. Similarly, the GOP\u2019s policy platform for 2024 also calls for \u201cthe opening of limited portions of federal lands to allow for new home construction.\u201d On Tuesday, Biden, along with the Housing and Urban Development Acting Secretary, Adrianne Todman, also announced $325 million in grant funding to seven cities to \u201cbuild more homes and revitalize neighborhoods.\u201d Those cities include Challanooga, Houston, Miami, Las Vegas, Syracuse, Trenton, New Jersey and Huntsville, Alabama. Rent cap proposal faces pushback from housing groups The Biden administration has addressed home affordability in the past, proposing a \u201cmortgage relief credit\u201d during his State of the Union address earlier this year that would provide $5,000 per year for two years for middle-class, first-time homebuyers. During CNN\u2019s presidential debate in June, Biden hinted at his new plan to address rent increases. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure we cap rents,\u201d he said. \u201cSo corporate greed can\u2019t take over.\u201d Biden also mentioned the plan on Thursday at a NATO Summit press conference. In a statement after the debate, the Housing Solutions Coalition, an alliance of major housing organizations, including the Mortgage Bankers Association, said that Biden\u2019s plan for rent caps would hurt renters rather than help them, though. \u201cDecades of academic research\u00a0from across the United States and around the world clearly show that rent caps \u2014 more commonly known as rent control \u2014 reduce the supply of available housing and fail to target those renters who need help the most while simultaneously harming other residents and the communities they reside in,\u201d the statement said. \u201cRent caps hurt renters and communities.\u201d However, a senior administration official said that the plan to cap rents is only intended to serve as a two-year bridge until rental units enter the market, bringing down rents. There are currently 1.6 million units under construction in the US as of May, according to Federal Reserve data.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/economy/biden-rent-increase-5-percent-cap-plan/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

Discovery, CNN\u2019s parent company). Overall, Netflix added 8.05 million new subscribers in its second quarter. Netflix\u2019s surge in new subscribers has been fueled in part by the company\u2019s effort to push users who share passwords to create their own accounts. However, the short-term subscriber jolt from the password-sharing crackdown could soon fade. On Thursday, Netflix said it expects the pace of its subscriber additions to slow in the third quarter. Netflix\u2019s stock fell nearly 2% in after-hours trading, but it has climbed more than 35% in 2024. The company recently disclosed that it would stop sharing its quarterly subscriber numbers beginning in 2025 in favor of a new disclosure: time spent on the platform. Netflix, in the past two months, has also pushed further into the world of live sports programming and experiences. And with Netflix\u2019s recent advance into advertising, the company is starting to look closer to the traditional media companies it seeks to disrupt, said Tim Nollen, a Netflix analyst at Macquarie. \u201cWhatever the old broadcasters were in their best of times, Netflix is becoming that in a new and probably longer-term, sustainable way,\u201d he said. The early stages of Netflix\u2019s evolution Netflix made its biggest sports announcement yet in May. The company made a three-year deal to broadcast the NFL\u2019s Christmas Day games. The deal kicks off this year with Netflix globally airing two NFL games on the holiday. In 2025 and 2026, Netflix will stream at least one holiday game. \u201cNetflix is now in live sports,\u201d Nollen said. \u201cThis means Netflix might be the only place you will be able to watch those two Christmas Day games, which could obviously add more subscribers.\u201d Airing football games has proven itself to be a winning strategy to juice subscriber numbers: In January, Peacock, NBCUniversal\u2019s streaming service, saw a jump of 2.8 million sign-ups in the three days leading up to its exclusive airing of an NFL playoff game. The event was \u201cthe single biggest subscriber acquisition moment ever measured\u201d by Peacock, according to the company. Earlier this year, Netflix also announced another high-profile foray into sports programming: A 10-year deal to air \u201cWWE Raw\u201d live, valued at more than $5 billion. \u201cWe\u2019re in live because our members love it. It drives a ton of engagement and it drives a ton of excitement, and those two things are very valuable,\u201d Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on the company\u2019s earnings call Thursday. \u201cThe good thing is advertisers like it too.\u201d But live sports aren\u2019t the only way Netflix is trying to expand its footprint. Last month, the company said it plans to open two massive entertainment venues called Netflix Houses. The \u201cexperiential\u201d complexes, in former department store locations at Dallas Galleria and King of Prussia mall (near Philadelphia), will each span more than 100,000 square feet and include events, themed gift shops and restaurants. Both will open in 2025. While these complexes don\u2019t quite reach the scale or footprint of Disney\u2019s or Universal\u2019s global theme parks, David Joyce, an analyst at Seaport, said the complexes are designed to drive brand loyalty. \u201cIt should help retain those customers and keep them in the Netflix ecosystem and paying for their subscriptions for longer,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/business/netflix-earnings-second-quarter/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_investing_election-markets-your-money", "text": "Stocks are soaring this year, but that could soon change as election chaos takes the market on a rollercoaster ride. The S&P 500 is up more than 15% since January and hasn\u2019t fallen by 2% in more than 353 trading sessions. That\u2019s the longest such streak since 2007 (right before the financial collapse). But this has been a destabilizing week for US stocks and the market trajectory could be shifting. Investors have struggled to find their footing in recent days as they contend with an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, rising odds that President Joe Biden will drop out of the election, attacks on Big Tech and chipmakers from both sides of the aisle and a global computer outage affecting airports, banks, hospitals and other businesses. The Dow fell 378 points, or 0.9%, on Friday as the tech outage continued to rattle investors. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were down 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. It\u2019s the latest session to see stocks oscillating this week, reaching new highs before swinging back down again. The S&P 500 posted a new record high on Tuesday. By Thursday, the index had logged its worst two-day decline since April \u2014 when Iran launched an attack on Israel. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq had its worst day since 2022. The selloff \u201ccame amidst intense political uncertainty,\u201d wrote Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank, \u201cas speculation continues to mount that President Biden will stand down as the Democratic nominee, perhaps before Monday according to many reports, which has the potential to completely upend the dynamics of the presidential election in November.\u201d Investors crave stability, and with about 100 days left until the election, they\u2019re worried that market mayhem has set in. So what does that mean for your money? The standard advice for investors is to invest for the long term and to avoid making any short-sighted election-inspired trades. \u201cWe do not favor making meaningful portfolio changes based on who you think might win the November election,\u201d said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo. \u201cThe economy\u2019s trend seems to be a clearer signal for an investor than trying to predict the eventual market impact of any election.\u201d Still, some argue that we\u2019re in the midst of a larger market rotation. Small-sized stocks prevail For the last two years, the stock market has been tied to the Federal Reserve\u2019s actions. Inflation and interest rates have been a guiding light for markets: A higher-than-expected inflation reading or tough speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell have frequently thrown stocks into freefall. Meanwhile, any data that shows signs of a crack in the job market has sent stocks soaring as investors bet on impending rate cuts. Now, investors are parrying that central bankers will finally cut interest rates in September after first signaling a move last December. And they\u2019re celebrating. Liz Young Thomas, head of investment strategies at SoFi, said she also thinks that investors might be more certain about the election than before, as President Donald Trump has seen better polling in the days following an attempt on his life. One clear indication of that celebration is the return of small-cap stocks. Smaller companies typically outperform large caps in declining-interest-rate environments because it\u2019s cheaper for them to borrow money and grow. This makes them more attractive to investors looking for better returns. In just seven trading days, the Russell 2000 (a small-cap index) has moved nearly 10% over the last month. \u201cThe new information has been a combination of lower US Treasury yields, cooler inflation data, and increased risk appetite on the possibility of a more certain US election outcome,\u201d said Young Thomas. The earnings data helps to confirm that the move has fundamental support from the index, but likely wasn\u2019t the driving force.\u201d Tech selloff Part of the reckoning between large-cap and small-cap stocks has been due to the sudden tech selloff. As expectations increase that the Fed will begin cutting rates in the fall, investors are starting to move out of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks that fueled record highs this year. Tech stocks took an additional pummeling this week after Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the Biden administration is mulling plans to impose more sanctions on Chinese tech firms and to heighten semiconductor trade restrictions between the US and China. Former President Donald Trump, meanwhile, said in an interview with Bloomberg that Taiwan should pay for its own defense. \u201cThey did take about 100% of our chip business,\u201d Trump said. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing are down more than 12% over the past five days. On Friday, a massive global outage of Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system, caused by a faulty update from cybersecurity company \u200b\u200bCrowdStrike, furthered the tech stock rout. Shares of CrowdStrike dropped more than 11% on Friday. Shares of Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet all closed the week lower. The bright side Investors have been largely resilient this year and some financial bigwigs say the election won\u2019t change that. JPMorgan Chase CFO Jeremy Barnum said during an earnings call last week that even though the election cycle is making big news, it isn\u2019t \u201cfinancially material in the context of earnings.\u201d The current economic environment, he said, is \u201cno different than any other.\u201d As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might change slightly.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/investing/election-markets-your-money/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_media_biden-mental-fitness", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s White House repeatedly and aggressively shot down reports\u00a0on\u00a0the president\u2019s age and any possible limitations\u00a0on his ability to perform all the duties of his office. But after his shaky debate performance last week, in which Biden routinely struggled to\u00a0get his point across, some in the White House press corps say they wish they had pushed harder to tell the story. In June, when the Wall Street Journal published a\u00a0lengthy piece\u00a0on President Joe Biden\u2019s mental\u00a0state, the newspaper\u00a0got\u00a0slammed.\u00a0The White House, its allies, and\u00a0some in the media\u00a0\u2013\u00a0including CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources\u00a0\u2013\u00a0criticized the Journal for quoting mostly Republican political foes on the record, who had a clear political motive to damage Biden\u2019s image. No Democrats were quoted on the record making those allegations, and several Democrats complained their on-the-record quotes praising Biden\u2019s sharpness were not included. The\u00a0Journal defended its reporting at the time. Last week\u2019s debate on CNN laid bare many of the concerns the Journal\u2019s reporting had raised \u2013 that the president has good days and bad days but can sometimes seem to slip up. A New York Times report on Tuesday raised similar concerns by those who have recently been in the room with Biden. The Times reported Biden has more frequent \u201clapses,\u201d although at other times he appears sharp. After Biden\u2019s lackluster performance last week, some are questioning whether the White House press corps dropped the ball on fully covering Biden\u2019s limitations. Biden\u2019s\u00a0age issue is not secret or new. Nearly every media outlet has reported on\u00a0growing concerns about\u00a0Biden\u2019s age well before the debate. The White House in the past has complained that the coverage is disproportionate, and that the media is spending more time covering Biden\u2019s age than his accomplishments as president versus former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies. The media has faced accusations that it has not covered Biden\u2019s mental fitness more aggressively because it wants to prop up the campaign in some way \u2013 an accusation the White House reporters CNN spoke to denied. Several White House reporters\u00a0told CNN that\u00a0the\u00a0coverage\u00a0of Biden\u2019s age and his mental stamina\u00a0should have\u00a0pushed harder. They cited several difficulties in doing so before the debate \u2013 from the obvious political motivations of sources who either want to protect Biden\u2019s image or project a certain image, to the blowback from pursuing such reports, especially from the White House and Democrats. A difficult task Like all past presidents, Biden has good days and bad days. It\u00a0can be tricky to report on something as difficult to define as a person aging, when his opponent\u00a0is a convicted felon, who regularly lies and has threatened to use the government to go after his political opponents. Still, some reporters said the press corps\u00a0could\u00a0have done a better job\u00a0covering\u00a0Biden\u2019s physical and mental state. The failure of the media, one White House reporter said,\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0pushing more aggressively\u00a0into Biden\u2019s abilities after the release of the Robert Hurr report in February, which called Biden a \u201cwell-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d Biden\u2019s age was also a right-wing talking point for years, something the White House was quick to point out to reporters,\u00a0which\u00a0may have inadvertently turned off any serious investigation. For example, deceptively edited clips of Biden from the G7 spread widely by right-wing media figures were made to seem as though he was aimlessly \u201cwandering off\u201d from fellow world leaders when really, he was speaking to parachutists who had just landed during a demonstration. \u201cThe right-wing media was calling him senile from day one, and that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cThen whenever you report on the age you were in some ways solidifying, giving credence to some people that were actually of bad faith.\u201d All the White House reporters who spoke to CNN for this piece chose to speak anonymously so they could speak more freely about their relationship with the White House. Keeping the president at a distance Reporters said the White House has not made the press corps\u2019 job easy:\u00a0The White House has put up guardrails around Biden, they say, and\u00a0he does not engage in as many interviews or planned press conferences\u00a0as previous presidents. At those events,\u00a0the press might be able to gauge how he\u2019s doing on the spot, without prepared remarks. \u201cThey keep him at arm\u2019s length, and he rarely does extended interviews,\u201d the reporter said of the White House,\u00a0although he acknowledged Biden has started giving more interviews as of late. Biden has done fewer interviews and formal press conferences than his most recent predecessors, according to data compiled by\u00a0Martha Joynt Kumar,\u00a0professor emerita of political science at Towson University who chronicles the presidents\u2019 interactions with the press. But on quick and informal interactions with the press, like shouted questions on the way to his helicopter or plane, Biden\u00a0as of this week has had 588 interactions, Kumar reports, second only to Trump when compared to recent presidents. But those interactions are not the same as an extended press conference, reporters noted. On Tuesday, ABC News announced Biden would sit down with George Stephanopoulos for an interview, his first since the debate. The White House press shop has also been very \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cfairly successful\u201d in mitigating coverage of concerns over the president\u2019s age,\u00a0said\u00a0another White House reporter who works for a different publication. \u201c[B]erating reporters who bring them reporting about age concerns, bemoaning that it\u2019s all anyone writes about (clearly, it\u2019s not) and often attacking pieces after they run,\u201d the reporter told CNN. \u201cI think that\u2019s left some folks to conclude that these stories are too painful to report or that they should pick their spots more. It\u2019s clear the age stories that have angered the White House (and the liberal Twittersphere) the most.\u201d Alex Thompson, a White House reporter for Axios, said on CNN the day after the debate that \u201cthe White House\u2019s response every single time\u00a0it\u00a0has come up for three-and-a-half years has been to deflect, to gaslight, to not tell the truth \u2013 not just to reporters, not just to other Democrats, but even at times to themselves about the president\u2019s limitations at his age.\u201d Still, this White House\u2019s recent conduct with reporters pales in comparison to Trump\u2019s team, which has done everything from revoking press access to reporters they disagree with, to calling reporters the \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d The White House declined to comment. Aging doesn\u2019t happen all at once Aging is also not a sudden moment.\u00a0That makes it trickier to report on. \u201cTo some extent, the decline has appeared to be gradual \u2014 hard to notice from day to day \u2014 and that\u2019s perhaps made it harder for reporters to determine when is the right moment to write something,\u201d one of the reporters said. Just a few days before the debate, Biden held a press conference at the G7 alongside Ukrainian President Vlodomyr Zelensky that passed off without anything of note in Biden\u2019s demeanor. But reporters pointed out (and have published stories noting) that the president has been using teleprompters at most big events, even fundraisers where in the past he might not have. He has also started to use the lower stairs to board Air Force One. Last year, The New York Times published a lengthy piece on the \u201ccomplicated reality of America\u2019s oldest president,\u201d which looked at some of those accommodations and concerns for his age, but also the moments where he showed stamina and vigor. Some reporters said that there has been a distinct change\u00a0within the last year, and that the press corps should have reported more aggressively on the accommodations made for the president. \u201cI think the press, most of the White House press, did suffer from a bit of lack of curiosity,\u201d one of the reporters said. Look who you\u2019re up against Biden\u2019s allies will often question coverage of the president\u2019s age, questioning why reporters focus on the president\u2019s age and mental lucidity and not on Trump\u2019s\u00a0\u2013\u00a0who, at 78,\u00a0was observed falling asleep during his hush money trial, has made his own major verbal flubs and bizarre statements, and regularly spouts complete falsehoods. \u201cIt makes sense to reflect on this now and ask whether we missed or, really, under-reported the story of Biden\u2019s age and decline. But it\u2019s complicated,\u201d one of the reporters said. \u201cThe fact that the political alternative to Biden is an authoritarian who sparked an insurrection and is a convicted felon does not mean that the press is failing American democracy to focus on Biden\u2019s obvious frailty.\u201d One of the reporters said the media can, and do, report on both. Biden\u2019s allies, however, say too much attention is placed on Biden\u2019s age and not on the threat Trump could pose to American democracy. But the reporters say they can, and should, do both. \u201cJust because you are reporting on Biden age, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not reporting on Trump\u2019s lies.\u00a0 I find that argument silly, and it seems one design towards like producing a certain outcome in the election, rather than like an honest reporting,\u201d one of the reporters said. The outlets that had received harsh blowback for their previous reports on Biden\u2019s lucidity now feel justified. A source familiar with the staff behind the Wall Street Journal\u2019s report said that when the piece first published, the reporters were approached by people with sympathy asking how they\u2019re doing \u201cas if something terrible had just happened,\u201d the source said. After the debate, the reporters started to get messages saying they were right.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/media/biden-mental-fitness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_tech_att-cyberattacks-data-privacy-laws", "text": "This week, AT&T notified millions of customers that their data was likely stolen in an April leak that the company disclosed earlier this month. Meanwhile, comprehensive laws that would protect customers from hacks keep struggling to pass, as AT&T and its rivals have fought back against and heavily influenced a patchwork of data laws \u2013 arguing the approach has failed to rein in the problem. AT&T customers\u2019 pilfered information was so valuable to cybercriminals that the FBI asked the company to delay filing a disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission because of potential national security and public safety concerns. The data was breached from \u201cnearly all\u201d of AT&T\u2019s cellular customers and the customers of wireless providers that used its network between May 1, 2022, and October 31, 2022. It\u2019s not the first time \u2013 even this year \u2013 that AT&T has been breached. The company was already grappling with an unrelated data leak that took place in March. At that time, AT&T said personal information, such as Social Security numbers on 73 million current and former customers, was released onto the dark web. Consumer advocates and some lawmakers have long argued for more protection of customer data. Though state laws have passed across almost 20 states, \u00a0the patchwork of regulations across states and agencies that regulates data privacy, can lead to inconsistencies, contradictions and lacunae. Complicating things further, lobbies from Big Tech to phone carriers have been heavily influencing many of these state and local regulation efforts. In a statement, AT&T said, \u201cWe have long supported a comprehensive federal privacy policy protecting all Americans that applies across the internet ecosystem. We continue to believe that a federal privacy policy should establish a consistent set of protections, enforced by a single regulator, for all consumers.\u201d Lobbies are at the \u2018crux of the problem\u2019 Keepers of private information like who you texted, what you\u2019re watching \u2013 in addition to your address and Social Security number \u2013 makes telecom companies\u2019 data a high-value target. \u00a0That could be invaluable data for phishing and targeted scam attempts. The data phone carriers hold is \u201cthe gateway into everything else on the internet,\u201d Dominic Sellitto, a cyber security professor at University at Buffalo, said. \u201cEvery communication that we have, everything goes through a telecom provider or internet service provider.\u201d And that wealth of data draws hackers. \u201cThese larger companies, because of their size and the treasure trove of data, certainly have a target on their backs,\u201d Sellitto noted. They\u2019re not alone: In just the past year, large cyberattacks have frozen car dealerships and delayed ambulances. Currently, data privacy laws exist in 19 states covering at least 150 million Americans, though differing in scale and scope. There are federal regulations on specific areas of privacy, like laws covering medical data or information about children, and agencies like the FCC regulate telecommunications. But there is no large, comprehensive data privacy law at the federal level, and many state laws are basically written by industries through their lobbyists, said Alan Butler, executive director and president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \u201cThe crux of the problem in legislating telecoms is the lobbyists and their effectiveness over many, many decades,\u201d said Eric Noonan, CEO of cybersecurity provider CyberSheath. Cybersecurity and data privacy go hand in hand. The heaviest proposed regulation would impose data minimization rules \u2014 meaning if companies collected less data, there would be less available for hackers to steal in the first place. There would also be stricter data security and notification rules if a hack does happen. It\u2019s unclear whether those rules would have prevented AT&T\u2019s hacks or better protected their customers. But consumer advocates have lambasted the telecom industry for getting in the way of more comprehensive laws. Trade groups stressed that realistic privacy laws have had success passing through many states. \u201cIn the absence of workable federal data privacy legislation, our multi-sector coalition is proud to have been one of many stakeholders that have worked on a comprehensive privacy framework that now covers well over 100 million Americans and has received overwhelming bipartisan support across state legislatures with dramatically different political dynamics,\u201d Andrew Kingman, counsel to the State Privacy and Security Coalition said in a statement. Industry trade groups say that while cyber security and data privacy can be interrelated, there is tension between those concepts that might not be fully covered in a data privacy law. What it\u2019s like trying to pass data privacy laws When Collin Walke, a data privacy and cybersecurity attorney, was in the Oklahoma House, he focused on data privacy legislation. After California passed its landmark data privacy law in 2018, he attempted to get similar legislation passed in his state. \u201cWe had lobbyists from Amazon. We had lobbyists from Google. We had all of that. But the number one impediment to us getting it passed in Oklahoma was AT&T and Verizon,\u201d Walke said to CNN. Verizon declined to comment. In a statement, Amazon said it supports \u201cU.S. federal privacy legislation that requires transparency, access to one\u2019s own personal information, and the ability to delete personal information, and prohibits the sale of personal data without consent. In the absence of congressional action, we support well-crafted state laws that protect consumers\u2019 privacy, while continuing to allow for innovation.\u201d Monica Priestley, a state representative in Vermont, said lobbyists from across industries \u201ccame out in full force at the last minute,\u201d even hosting webinars and calls at the town or city level, against a landmark privacy bill this year. One lobby, the State Privacy & Security Coalition, represents AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Meta, as well as automobile, healthcare and payment card companies. The Vermont governor vetoed the bill in June, which would have been one of the strongest in the country. Industry trade groups said that the ability to sue companies for data violations and strict data minimization requirements would have been too costly for Vermont small businesses to comply to. \u201cThe hardest part about these bills is they are so technical in nature, and the industry tends to hand the state a policy and encourage them to run with that,\u201d Priestley said. \u201cIndustries created this monster that is out of control, and they themselves are at risk. And something\u2019s got to change.\u201d Why doesn\u2019t a national privacy law exist? Advocates say Big Tech lobbies and telecommunications lobbies have shifted their focus from squashing the federal conversation to getting deeply involved at the state level. \u201cA national law puts everyone on a level playing field,\u201d Noonan said. \u201cIt establishes the baseline of what good looks like for these critical infrastructure providers, including telecommunications companies, and then it gives the government a standard to enforce.\u201d Advocates for a sweeping law say the average consumer shouldn\u2019t have to parse dense user agreements to find out what is going on with their data. In a statement, AT&T said, \u201cOur customers can manage how we use and share their information for certain activities including advertising and marketing, and can opt out at any time.\u201d But tighter regulations mean companies must spend more resources beefing up their cybersecurity. Companies also lobby against allowing individuals to sue for damages. A lot of a telecommunication company\u2019s business is rooted in the data brokerage market, multiple privacy experts told CNN. And it\u2019s valuable data. \u201cLike many other industries, the telecommunications industry sees the commercialization of data for advertising uses as an additional revenue source,\u201d Butler said. In April, the FCC fined AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon nearly $200 million for illegally sharing customers\u2019 personal data without their consent. The fines stem from allegations in 2020 by the Federal Communications Commission that for years, the companies had improperly shared users\u2019 geolocation histories to third parties, including to prisons, as part of their commercial programs. In response to the FCC fines, all of the wireless carriers said they expect to appeal the decision. The FCC is also not the only regulator for telecom companies, which can be giant entities. \u201cIt\u2019s a very opaque space that is begging for clarity, and that clarity can only come through regulation,\u201d Noonan said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/tech/att-cyberattacks-data-privacy-laws/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

Filings show that the company took on about $325 million in debt following its purchase of Redbox in 2022 from private equity giant Apollo Global Management. The plan was to make it into an entertainment conglomerate, combining the DVD rental business with its free streaming services, like Crackle, the entertainment platform once owned by Sony.

CSSE declined to comment. Deadline previously reported that Redbox hadn\u2019t paid employees for a week, and medical benefits have been suspended.

{"id": "2024_07_19_tech_crowdstrike-update-global-outage-explainer", "text": "The global\u00a0computer outage affecting airports, banks and other businesses on Friday appears to stem at least partly from a software update issued by major US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, experts told CNN. CrowdStrike told customers early Friday that the outages were caused by \u201ca defect found in a single content update of its software on Microsoft Windows operating systems, according to a post on X from CEO George Kurtz. Kurtz later apologized to customers Friday, and said the company is \u201cdeeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption,\u201d\u00a0he posted on X. He reiterated that the outage was not caused by a security breach or a cyberattack and maintained that CrowdStrike\u2019s customers were \u201cfully protected.\u201d \u201cWe are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on,\u201d Kurtz said, reiterating that the cause of the outage was not malicious. The company\u2019s engineers took action to address the problem, according to an advisory viewed by CNN, which told customers to reboot their computers and perform other actions if they were still having technical issues. The issue is specific to Falcon, one of CrowdStrike\u2019s main software products, and is not impacting Mac or Linux operating systems, according to the advisory. Crowdstrike says Falcon is designed to protect files saved in the cloud. CrowdStrike\u2019s cybersecurity software \u2014\u00a0used by numerous Fortune 500 companies, including  major global banks, healthcare and energy companies \u2014\u00a0detects and blocks hacking threats. Like other cybersecurity products, the software requires deep-level access to a computer\u2019s operating system to scan for those threats. In this case, computers running Microsoft Windows appear to be crashing because of the faulty way a software code update issued by CrowdStrike is interacting with the Windows system. The company said the outage was not caused by a security incident or a cyberattack. Kurtz, in his post, said the issue was identified and isolated, and engineers deployed an update to fix the problem. CrowdStrike\u2019s (CRWD) stock fell 9% in midafternoon trading. What is CrowdStrike known for? The massive cybersecurity company does business around the world through software sales and investigations of major hacks. The company also helps run cybersecurity investigations for the US government. For example, CrowdStrike has tracked North Korean hackers for more than a decade, the\u00a0company says. It also was tasked with tracking the hacking groups that carried out the 2014 hack on Sony Pictures. But CrowdStrike is perhaps best known for investigating the Russian hack of Democratic National Committee computers during the 2016 US election. It has been at the center of false conspiracy theories since 2016, most notably after a\u00a0White House transcript\u00a0revealed former President Donald Trump mentioned Crowdstrike in his July 2016 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that led to his first impeachment. CrowdStrike was the first to publicly sound the alarm about Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election and CrowdStrike\u2019s assessment was later confirmed by US intelligence agencies.

{"id": "2024_04_23_cars_electric-vehicle-sales-forecast-iea", "text": "Global electric vehicle sales are set to rise by more than a fifth to reach 17 million this year, powered by drivers in China, according to the International Energy Agency. In a report Tuesday, the IEA projected that \u201csurging demand\u201d for EVs over the next decade was set \u201cto remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport.\u201d It expects half of all cars sold globally to be electric by 2035, up from more than one in five this year, provided charging infrastructure keeps pace. The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs. The agency\u2019s bullish long-term outlook for EVs \u2014 based on current government policies \u2014 comes just days after the world\u2019s biggest battery EV maker Tesla slashed its prices in major markets to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers. Recent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The data \u201cdoes not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars. It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday. The growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers. The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union rose almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. In a statement, Birol said: \u201cRather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.\u201d Despite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats. In the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the world\u2019s biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States. Earlier this month, Tesla posted its first annual drop in sales in nearly four years. The company\u2019s stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year. China\u2019s BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023. Automakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the \u201cpace of the transition to EVs\u2026 will hinge on affordability.\u201d In China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average. \u201cIntensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,\u201d the IEA said. \u201cGrowing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,\u201d it added. Last year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market. \u201cChina is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,\u201d Birol said. Concerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an investigation late last year into China\u2019s state support for EV makers. The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the region\u2019s biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW. EV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country. By 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA. That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year. \u201cThis shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,\u201d Birol said. The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector. In addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States. Under current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA.

{"id": "2024_06_01_success_buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage", "text": "Moving somewhere new when you retire isn\u2019t uncommon. But deciding whether to take out a new mortgage to buy a home is a big deal. Much of your financial life is changing as you transition from a steady paycheck to a mix of fixed and variable income and a new lifestyle. So adding a large debt to the picture isn\u2019t an easy call. That\u2019s especially true now that mortgage rates hover around 7% and home prices keep rising. \u201cAny time you take on debt, you increase risk in your situation,\u201d said Illinois-based certified financial planner Jim Stork. More than a third (35%) of homebuyers last year were between the ages of 59 and 98, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Within that group, a majority financed their purchases. Whether taking out a new mortgage makes sense for you depends on a lot of factors, including how to prove to a lender that you\u2019re a good credit risk, plus your feelings about the debt and the ongoing cost of maintaining a home. To get a mortgage, your age won\u2019t be a factor, but your income will be If you\u2019re concerned that you may be less attractive to a mortgage banker because you\u2019ve hit retirement age, know that it is illegal to discriminate against anyone applying for a mortgage based on their age. Lenders\u2019 chief focus will be on your ability to repay your mortgage with your various sources of non-paycheck income. \u201cWhen you qualify for a mortgage, it\u2019s all based on your income,\u201d said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage. That, and of course any debt you have that will soak up your income, but we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. The income sources that lenders consider, absent a regular paycheck, include: Social Security benefits, pension or annuity income, spousal benefits, disability payments, interest and dividends and your 401(k) or IRA. If a portion of your income is not subject to tax, the lender may treat it as worth 25% more. Fannie Mae offers this example: Say 15% of a $1,500 monthly Social Security benefit is tax free. That means $225 of it will not be subject to tax ($1,500 x 15%). And 25% of that amount comes to $56 ($225 x 25%). So that $56 can be added to a person\u2019s qualifying Social Security income amount ($1,500 + $56 = $1,556). If you want to use your nest egg, different methods can be used to calculate how much income it would provide. There is the asset depletion method in which your eligible assets are divided by your loan term. In the case of a 30-year mortgage, that would be 360 months. If your IRA is worth $700,000, that translates into $1,944 per month ($700,000/360). \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to take the money out \u2014 but you can use your assets [to qualify for a mortgage] as if you were going to take the distribution,\u201d Cohn said. Another option: If you are at least 59-1/2, you can start taking monthly distributions from an IRA without penalty \u2014 or a 401(k) if your plan rules permit \u2014 and the lender will count that as income so long as you show that you have sufficient funds in the account to keep taking that same monthly distribution for three years. Once you close on your home, Cohn said, you can reduce or stop taking distributions if you choose. That assumes you are not yet in your 70s when the IRS requires you to start taking minimum distributions, said Mark Luscombe, a principal analyst at Wolters, Kluwer Tax & Accounting. Burdened by debt? Lenders will also assess your debt-to-income ratio, because no matter how much income you have, the big question is how much of it will be consumed by your debts. The debt portion is composed of your expected mortgage payment plus any credit card, student loan, car loan or other outstanding debt you may have. Generally speaking, for conventional loans your DTI ratio can be up to 50%, Cohen said. That ratio falls to between 43% and 45% if you\u2019re taking out a jumbo loan, she added. A jumbo loan exceeds the conforming loan limits in the area you want to buy. But ideally your debt level will fall well below these top limits, both for the lender\u2019s sake and yours. And, of course, the higher your credit score, the better the interest rate you can get on a mortgage. What you should consider before taking out a mortgage Even before seeking a mortgage, get a good grasp on your expected monthly income and expenses in retirement. Compared to pre-retirement earnings, \u201cMost (new retirees) see a decrease in income,\u201d said certified financial planner Lori Trawinski, director of finance and employment at AARP. While some expenses may also decline \u2014 e.g., work-related costs like commuting \u2014 others may increase over time, Trawinski said, like medical costs, property taxes, home insurance and utilities. Of course, you can downsize and move to a lower-cost area. But if you stay near where you lived during your career, your expenses are likely to rise over time. Also, Trawinski noted, if you\u2019re married, consider what will happen to your household income when one spouse dies. This will help you assess your future comfort level in carrying a mortgage. \u201cPeople often fail to plan for the death of a spouse. You can take a big hit to your income when that happens,\u201d she said. If you do move to a new state or region, weigh renting first. You can get a better sense of the cost of living in the area and decide whether it\u2019s a good fit for you. As Stork put it, \u201cFlorida in August is not as fun as Florida in January.\u201d How much are you really willing to take on? All the usual financial decisions that go into homebuying apply no matter your age. But, in retirement especially, you don\u2019t want to take on more debt than necessary, since the cost of a mortgage is fixed, but the returns on your investments, the housing market and your health needs are variable. At the very least, Stork said, consider whether you can put enough money down \u2014 at least 20% \u2014 to avoid having to pay private mortgage insurance. Beyond that, consider whether you feel comfortable keeping up \u2014 and paying for \u2014 maintenance on a home. Maintenance might amount to 2% a year of your home\u2019s value, Stork said. That amounts to $10,000 a year on a $500,000 home. Maintenance is essential in preserving the value of your house should you ever decide to sell. How would your mortgage interest rate compare to a reasonable rate of return on your investments? The decision to get a mortgage was a lot easier for retirees when rates were historically low \u2014 roughly 3% \u2014 and their nest eggs were earning a lot more. \u201cBut at today\u2019s rates it\u2019s a much harder calculation,\u201d Stork said. This is especially the case if you\u2019re a very conservative investor. \u201cIf your CDs are earning 4% and a mortgage would cost you 7%, you will lose money every day on that decision,\u201d Stork explained. To get the truest reading on what makes financial sense, compare mortgage expenses to your investment returns on an after-tax basis, Stork noted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/success/buying-house-in-retirement-mortgage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

Macy\u2019s board of directors voted unanimously to end discussions with Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management over the investors\u2019 offers to acquire the chain. Macy\u2019s said Monday it was unclear that the investors could finance a deal and it was not in shareholders\u2019 best interest. The investors planned to take Macy\u2019s private and consider spinning off its real estate assets or separating its online operations from brick-and-mortar stores. The investors have been trying to buy Macy\u2019s since December. But Macy\u2019s rejected a previous offer to buy the company at $21 a share in January. In March, the investors upped its offer to $24 a share, and Macy\u2019s agreed to enter into talks about the bid. Now, it\u2019s calling off talks. Macy\u2019s will instead stick with its own strategy, led by new CEO Tony Spring, which includes closing underperforming Macy\u2019s stores and investing in its luxury Bloomingdale\u2019s and Bluemercury chains. Investor groups such as private equity funds and hedge funds have been active in recent decades in buying struggling or under-performing retailers, with the stated goal of taking them private, improving their operations and selling them for a profit. But the results have often led to closures, not salvation, for companies such as Sears and Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. Macy\u2019s decision to end talks with the investors will benefit the chain, said retail analyst Neil Saunders in a note to clients Monday. \u201cOther than seeking to monetize Macy\u2019s real estate assets for short term gain, neither party brought any long-term value to the table,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of the activist investor proposals would have significantly weakened Macy\u2019s and hampered its ability to survive as a retail operation.\u201d Macy\u2019s stock tumbled around 13% during morning trading Wednesday to $16 a share. Macy\u2019s and other\u00a0traditional department stores\u00a0have struggled, as competition both from online retailers like Amazon and big box retailers, such as Walmart and Target \u2013 which offer shoppers the chance to buy groceries as well as clothes and other household goods \u2013 has left Macy\u2019s with a smaller slice of the retail pie. Analysts also say Macy\u2019s has underinvested, and cost-cutting measures have hurt customer service in stores.

{"id": "2024_07_19_media_evan-gershkovich-espionage-trial-verdict-intl", "text": "Evan Gershkovich, the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War, has been found guilty of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison by a Russian court, in a case that the US government, his newspaper and supporters have denounced as a sham. The court in Yekaterinburg announced the guilty verdict and sentencing on Friday shortly after 3 p.m. local time (8 a.m. ET). The court heard closing arguments and 32-year-old Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter, delivered his closing remarks behind closed doors on Friday morning. The case\u2019s rapid conclusion comes just weeks after Gershkovich first appeared in a glass cage with his head recently shaved at the start of his trial on June 26. On that day, Gershkovich stood cross-armed, occasionally smiling and waving to the crowd of reporters. The speed of the trial has raised questions over whether the Kremlin is intending to use him as part of a prisoner swap deal with the United States, suggestions which spokesman Dmitry Peskov left without comment when asked about them on a Friday conference call ahead of the verdict announcement. In June,\u00a0Moscow\u00a0confirmed again\u00a0that contacts are ongoing regarding a potential prisoner exchange deal for Gershkovich, but Peskov\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0insisted that those conversations were to be carried out in \u201cabsolute silence\u201d to prevent complications. Gershkovich was arrested while reporting for the WSJ, during a trip to Yekaterinburg in March 2023, and later accused of spying for the CIA.\u00a0Russian authorities have never offered any public evidence to support their claims. Within two weeks of his arrest in March 2023, the US State Department designated him as wrongfully detained and called for his immediate release. In a statement following Friday\u2019s sentencing, Gershkovich\u2019s employer said: \u201cThis disgraceful, sham conviction comes after Evan has spent 478 days in prison, wrongfully detained, away from his family and friends, prevented from reporting, all for doing his job as a journalist. \u201cWe will continue to do everything possible to press for Evan\u2019s release and to support his family,\u201d the statement from Dow Jones CEO and Wall Street Journal Publisher Almar Latour and Wall Street Journal Editor in Chief Emma Tucker continued. \u201cJournalism is not a crime, and we will not rest until he\u2019s released. This must end now,\u201d it added. At the United Nations Security Council on Friday, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield Ambassador also raised Gershkovich\u2019s case. \u201cLet me begin with the news coming out of Russia this morning. Evan Gershkovich was sentenced to 16 years. He has committed no crime. He is being punished because he is a journalist, and he is an American. Simple as that,\u201d she said. Journalist advocacy group, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), joined the chorus of criticism, pointing out Russia\u2019s current record as the world\u2019s fourth-worst jailer of journalists, with at least 22 currently behind bars. \u201cJournalists are not pawns in geopolitical games. It\u2019s time to stop hostage diplomacy and free him immediately,\u201d CPJ Director Carlos Martinez de la Serna said in a statement. 15 days to appeal The verdict has yet to enter into force, and the defense can appeal the conviction within 15 days, judge Andrey Mineyev said while delivering his verdict.\u00a0The court also ordered Gershkovich to pay procedural costs of 6,708 rubles ($77), and for some of his personal items, including an iPhone and a notepad, to be destroyed. According to the judge, the time Gershkovich has already spent in detention since last March will count towards his sentence. Following his arrest, Gershkovich\u00a0was held in Moscow\u2019s notorious Lefortovo prison, spending almost every hour of the day in a small cell,\u00a0before being transferred to the city of Yekaterinburg in the Urals more than 1,100 miles east of the capital. He passed the time by writing letters to his friends and family, his parents said in an interview with the WSJ, adding that he was allowed just one hour of walking per day. Gershkovich, the US government, and the WSJ have vehemently denied the charges against him. US and Western officials have accused Russia of using Gershkovich and other jailed foreigners as bargaining chips for possible prisoner exchanges. A high-profile swap\u00a0in 2022 saw US basketball star Brittney Griner exchanged for arms dealer Viktor Bout. But Russia\u00a0refused\u00a0to release another jailed US citizen, Paul Whelan, as it was seeking a former colonel from Russia\u2019s domestic spy organization in return. Whelan told CNN on Friday that he feels \u201csympathy and empathy\u201d for Gershkovich, but expressed hope that the latest developments could open the door for a deal to secure both of their release. Whelan, who called CNN from his remote prison camp in Mordovia Friday, said he was able to watch a news broadcast about the sentencing. \u201cThe only thing I could think about was, when I was standing in court, listening to the judge read the false tale of my conviction and hearing that I would have to serve 16 years in prison. And there\u2019s surreal experience of knowing that you were 100% innocent, and that\u00a0this, this, stage show, this drama was going on around you,\u201d Whelan said. Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously suggested \u201can agreement can be reached\u201d with the United States to release Gershkovich and alluded to the case of a Russian national convicted of carrying out an assassination in Berlin in 2019, in an interview with right-wing US media personality Tucker Carlson in February. The trial of Gershkovich, the American-born son of Soviet-era emigres to the US, has highlighted the extent to which Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has harmed relations between Moscow and Washington. In their indictment, Russian prosecutors said that \u201cunder instructions from the CIA\u201d and \u201cusing painstaking conspiratorial methods,\u201d Gershkovich \u201cwas collecting secret information\u201d about a Russian tank factory.

{"id": "rnc-convention-news-media-coverage", "text": "News organizations are being confronted this week with a thorny challenge. In the wake of former\u00a0President Donald Trump\u00a0narrowly surviving a horrific assassination attempt, executives are more cognizant than ever about the fraught political environment in which they are operating. But news outlets also understand that they must offer audiences clear and direct coverage of theRepublican National Convention. That means not being afraid to call out Trump and the GOP for any promotion of misinformation and/or conspiracy theories. It means not legitimizing and normalizing the radical nature of the party. And it means being blunt about how some of Trump\u2019s avowed plans would upend American democracy and warp the foundational principles embedded within the fabric of the country. Threading that needle will surely prove to be no easy task, especially as Trump\u2019s allies work the refs in the news media and attempt to place any discussion about the threats posed to democracy outside the Overton Window. Already, on Monday, that strategy was on display on opening night at the RNC, with\u00a0Donald Trump Jr.\u00a0berating an\u00a0NBC News\u00a0reporter for having the nerve to ask tough \u2014\u00a0but fair\u00a0\u2014 questions about the\u00a0Republican Party\u2019simmigration proposals. \u201cEven 48 hours later, you couldn\u2019t wait,\u201d Trump Jr. exclaimed, scolding the reporter. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t wait with your lies and with your nonsense. So just get out of here.\u201d Broadcast television outlets will have, perhaps, the most difficult balancing act this week, given the eyes of the nation will quite literally be on their programming. Will they cede their platforms to bad-faith actors? Will they carry the speeches from politicians and others who they know to be lying to their audiences? And if they do air brazen lies to millions, how aggressively will they fact check in the immediate moments afterward? Over the course of this campaign cycle, too many news organizations have inexplicably declined to showcase clear-eyed judgment and recognize that the GOP has been disfigured from its former self, becoming far more extreme in nature over the years. This isn\u2019t the Republican Party of the 1990s. But some news executives seem hellbent on covering the party as if it were. That said, there were promising signs on Monday night, with regard to RNC coverage. Television news outlets, by and large, exercised caution about who they beamed into living rooms and offered viewers important context on the speakers and what they were saying. The coverage was not without flaws, but showed that news organizations were doing their best to meet the difficult moment in the challenging live setting. Given the stakes for the country, hopefully responsible coverage will win the week, instead of the type that turns a blind eye to anti-democratic and extreme behavior.", "source": "http://cnn.com/rnc-convention-news-media-coverage/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}

Shares of Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet are on pace to close the week lower, while Tesla is on track to end slightly higher. Tech stocks also took a hit this week after Bloomberg\u00a0reported Tuesday that the Biden administration is mulling plans to impose more sanctions on Chinese tech firms and to heighten semiconductor trade restrictions between the US and China.

Shares of the tech behemoth rose 2.1% to an all-time high close of $377.44 on Monday, beating the previous record of $376.17. That comes after shares of Microsoft fell 1.7% on Friday, when Sam Altman was ousted from his position at OpenAI in a boardroom coup. Microsoft is the artificial intelligence firm\u2019s biggest stakeholder, with a $13 billion investment in the company. Greg Brockman, who co-founded OpenAI and quit after Altman\u2019s firing, is also joining Microsoft. Altman\u2019s hiring ended days of speculation that the former chief executive could return to the firm after his dramatic firing. Emmett Shear, former CEO of Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch, will replace OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati as interim chief executive. Microsoft shares are up about 56% for the year.

{"id": "2024_07_19_business_delta-american-airlines-flights-outage-intl-hnk", "text": "Thousands of US flights were grounded Friday as a technical disaster\u00a0plagued government agencies and\u00a0businesses worldwide\u00a0\u2013 leading to countless stranded passengers, canceled medical procedures and\u00a0disrupted 911 services. A cybersecurity company said the debacle is \u201cnot a security incident or cyberattack.\u201d But the technical fiasco has paralyzed airlines, banks, state agencies and even emergency services around the world. As of Friday evening, more than 3,000 flights into, out of or within the United States had been canceled and more than 11,000 delayed, according to FlightAware.com. Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina told passengers not to come to the airport unless they had confirmed their flights. Bewildered travelers at the world\u2019s busiest airport in Atlanta were stranded as they tried to get to urgent events. \u201cTomorrow, I have a funeral in the afternoon,\u201d said Ty Kelley, who was stuck at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport \u2013 which had the most cancellations Friday morning. \u201cAnd then on Sunday, I have my sister\u2019s 50th birthday party,\u201d Kelley said. But it\u2019s not clear when or if she\u2019ll make it to those events: \u201cIt\u2019s really chaotic. It\u2019s frustrating. And I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this.\u201d Live updates: Global tech outages hit airlines, banks and businesses The Federal Aviation Administration \u201cis closely monitoring a technical issue impacting IT systems at U.S. airlines,\u201d the agency posted on social media. \u201cSeveral airlines have requested FAA assistance with ground stops until the issue is resolved.\u201d CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that has Microsoft among its clients, \u201cis actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts,\u201d CEO George Kurtz posted on X. \u201cThis is not a\u00a0security\u00a0incident or\u00a0cyberattack.\u201d Kurtz promised customers \u201cfull transparency\u201d on how the outage occurred. He said CrowdStrike would take steps \u201cto prevent anything like this from happening again,\u201d according to a statement on CrowdStrike\u2019s website. \u201cWe have mobilized all of CrowdStrike to help you and your teams\u201d to recover from the outage, the CEO told customers. But that could be easier said than done: Manual restarts of individual systems take time and expertise that some customers don\u2019t have, which is why companies are slow to recover from the outage. Former McAfee CEO Dave DeWalt told CNN that a group of private sector and government agencies worked overnight to \u201cascertain the threat\u201d and find a solution to the global outage.\u00a0He said he was on the call, which included the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and other private and government organizations. Microsoft released a statement midday explaining the situation. \u201cYesterday, CrowdStrike released an update that began impacting IT systems globally,\u201d Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella posted on X. \u201cWe are aware of this issue and are working closely with CrowdStrike and across the industry to provide customers technical guidance and support to safely bring their systems back online.\u201d What US airlines are saying \u2013 Delta Air Lines \u201cpaused its global flight schedule this morning due to a vendor technology issue that is impacting several airlines and businesses around the world,\u201d it said in a statement Friday morning. Delta later said it was resuming some flights. The airline apologized to impacted customers and said a travel waiver would be issued. \u2013 JetBlue operations \u201cremain normal and we are not experiencing any system-wide delays or cancelations,\u201d the airline said in an email to CNN. However, \u201cCustomers should monitor their flight status and build in extra time in the event that this outage has impacted specific airports due to outages at other airlines, airport operators, or government agencies.\u201d \u2013 American Airlines said it has resolved the issue affecting its operations. \u201cEarlier this morning, a technical issue with a vendor impacted multiple carriers, including American. As of 5 a.m. ET, we have been able to safely re-establish our operation,\u201d American said in a statement. \u201cWe apologize to our customers for the inconvenience.\u201d \u2013 Spirit Airlines said in a travel advisory its reservation system was impacted by the outage. The\u00a0airline asked passengers to check back for updates and apologized \u201cfor any inconvenience this may cause.\u201d \u2013 Southwest Airlines told CNN the outage hasn\u2019t impacted its operations. \u2013 Frontier Airlines and some competitors were brought to a standstill for hours after a\u00a0significant\u00a0Microsoft outage Thursday. The ground stop for those airlines has been lifted, and Frontier offered refunds to inconvenienced passengers. \u2013 United Airlines said it was resuming \u201csome flights\u201d early Friday morning. United cautioned travelers they might experience delays and issued waivers for eligible customers to change their travel plans. \u2013 Allegiant Air and Sun Country Airlines said they were having difficulties involving booking, check-in and trip-managing functions online. The FAA announced Friday morning all Allegiant flights would be grounded. \u2013 Numerous international airlines reported technical disruptions, including Virgin Australia and Qantas, along with airports across Europe and Asia-Pacific. Federal services and health care are stymied\n                  \n                   The calamity also struck hospitals and federal agencies, forcing each to scramble for solutions. \u201cMany of our Microsoft-based computer systems have been affected by the worldwide technology outage,\u201d Cincinnati Children\u2019s hospital posted on X. \u201cOur teams are working hard to minimize disruption to patient care and system operations, and we are bringing systems back up as quickly as possible.\u201d At Harris Health System in Houston, \u201celective hospital procedures are being canceled today and will be rescheduled when the information systems issues are resolved.\u201d At Mass General Brigham in Boston, \u201call previously scheduled non-urgent surgeries, procedures, and medical visits are cancelled today,\u201d the health care system told CNN in a statement. \u201cMass General Brigham remains open to provide care to patients with urgent health concerns in our clinics and emergency departments, and we continue to care for all patients currently receiving care in our hospitals.\u201d And in Canada\u2019s British Columbia, the Provincial Health Services Authority announced the health system was affected by the IT outage. \u201cWe have implemented contingency plans to ensure that our health care services remain operational, and that patient care is not disrupted to the best of our ability,\u201d said the organization. In addition to hospitals, blood donation centers have experienced challenges due to flight cancellations and delays. One center, Blood Assurance, told CNN that a planned shipment was postponed due to flight delays and cancellations. \u201cWe are asking community members to help through donation,\u201d Blood Assurance said in an email. \u201cWe have a fantastic community of donors that always shows up when we need them.\u201d Elsewhere, New York Blood Center, a supplier of blood to approximately 200 hospitals in the Northeast, has put in place an emergency driving operation to distribute collected blood, said Andrea Cefarelli, the senior vice president of New York Blood Center Enterprises. Test tubes of blood sent to be tested before they\u2019re distributed \u201care not making it onto planes from yesterday and today, requiring for us to drive them,\u201d Cefarelli told CNN in a phone call. \u201cThere is going to be a 12-24 hour delay in getting the test results.\u201d The American Red Cross has reassured patients and donors that they are not impacted by the global IT outage as they do not use CrowdStrike software. The US Department of Justice was searching for workarounds Friday, according to an internal memo viewed by CNN. The memo said the CrowdStrike issue \u201cis significant and there is currently no estimated restoration time.\u201d And due to the Microsoft and CrowdStrike debacle, \u201clocal Social Security offices are closed to the public today,\u201d the Social Security Administration\u2019s website said. Some 911 services went down as Portland issues an emergency declaration The technical disaster affected some 911 operations in the United States; mass transit in New York and Washington, DC; banking in Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom; Hong Kong\u2019s Disneyland; and the Israeli health service. In Oregon, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler issued an emergency declaration. \u201cCity services that rely on Microsoft Operating Systems using Crowdstrike Endpoint Protection, including certain essential City service providers, are impacted by the problem including emergency communications,\u201d the mayor\u2019s office said, though 911 operations were not impacted. But in Alaska, many\u00a0911\u00a0and non-emergency call centers weren\u2019t working properly, Alaska State Troopers said. Hours later, the agency said 911 services had been restored. In New Hampshire, some\u00a0911\u00a0services were down across the state overnight but have since been restored, New Hampshire\u00a0911\u00a0said in a\u00a0post. Phoenix police said the technical problems impacted the department\u2019s computerized\u00a0911\u00a0dispatch center. \u201cOur\u00a0911\u00a0center remains operational. If you need to call\u00a0911, stay on the line if you are put on a brief hold,\u201d Phoenix police posted on X Friday morning. Later in the morning, the department said its \u201csystems have been restored.\u201d In New York City,\u00a0911\u00a0services are operational, the mayor\u2019s press secretary told CNN. \u201cFDNY IT and Communication teams implemented our redundancy procedures upon notification of the CrowdStrike outage,\u201d New York fire department spokesperson Jim Long told CNN Friday. CNN has reached out to the Federal Communications Commission for more information on nationwide\u00a0911\u00a0outages. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of reports of a systems outage causing disruptions in service, including 911,\u201d the FCC posted late Friday morning on X. \u201cWe\u2019re working closely with other federal agencies to provide assistance and determine the extent of these service disruptions.\u201d State agencies are hit hard, too In some states, driver services ground to a halt due to the technical problems. North Carolina\u2019s driver\u2019s license and plate services are \u201cunable to assist customers this morning due to the current global Microsoft and CrowdStrike outage,\u201d the North Carolina Department of Transportation said. The agency said services will resume \u201conce the global outage has been repaired.\u201d Georgia\u2019s Department of Driver Services said operations were unavailable \u201cDue to the Microsoft/CrowdStrike Global outage.\u201d And in Tennessee, driver services centers might not be able to process transactions, state officials said Friday morning. Residents in Texas were not able to get IDs or driver\u2019s licenses on Friday. \u201cThe Department of Safety and Homeland Security will provide updates as information becomes available,\u201d the agency said. \u201cWe apologize for the inconvenience the outage has caused.\u201d In New York City, arrival information for trains and buses went down for hours before being restored Friday afternoon, according to the MTA. Some airports are \u2018absolutely insane\u2019 The situation at Philadelphia International Airport is \u201cabsolutely insane\u201d as thousands of people cram together, waiting for answers, traveler William Sikora III said. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s getting really hot in here,\u201d Sikora told CNN on Friday morning. He was trying to make the cross-country journey from Philadelphia to Los Angeles, but feared repeated delays would eventually turn into cancellations. His sentiments were echoed by would-be passengers in Atlanta, where airport officials told CNN they expected 300,000 passengers to pass through the world\u2019s busiest airport. \u201cNobody was really giving us answers. They just said our system\u2019s down, our system\u2019s down,\u201d New Jersey resident Jennifer Small told CNN. She slept at the airport overnight and has had her flight canceled twice. \u201cI want to get home to my son,\u201d Small said. But she doesn\u2019t think she\u2019ll be able to go home until Saturday. Spirit Airlines customer Miya Haney was stuck in Atlanta with her toddler daughter, trying to get to Boston for a birthday party. \u201cI\u2019m just beyond frustrated,\u201d Haney said. Spirit Airlines was using a manual check-in process, with \u201ca person going up and down shouting \u2018Boston here, flight number here,\u2019\u201d Haney said. \u201cI have no idea when we are going to get called.\u201d Hotels are also feeling the impact of the outages: Marriott International says some of its hotel systems have been impacted by the ongoing outage. \u201cWe are actively working with our vendors to resolve issues that have impacted certain hotel systems,\u201d the company, which has 8,900 properties in 141 countries and territories, said in a statement Friday afternoon. \u201cWe apologize for any inconvenience that guests may experience.\u201d This is a developing story and has been updated.

{"id": "2024_07_16_media_masha-gessen-russia-sentencing-ukraine-intl", "text": "Russian-American journalist Masha Gessen was sentenced to eight years in prison by a Moscow court Monday for criticizing the Russian military, becoming the latest target of a crackdown on critics of the Kremlin. Gessen was convicted in absentia on charges of disseminating \u201cfalse information\u201d about the Russian armed forces, according to the Moscow court statement. The Russian-born journalist and writer is an opinion columnist for\u00a0The New York Times and\u00a0the author of numerous books about Russia, including the award\u2013winning\u00a0\u201cThe Future Is History: How Totalitarianism Reclaimed Russia.\u201d Gessen, who lives in the United States, has been heavily critical of Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine and, over many years, has condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s crackdown on human and LGBTQ+ rights. In a letter posted to\u00a0Facebook\u00a0Monday, Gessen called the charges \u201cillegal and unfounded.\u201d Gessen, who uses \u201cthey/them\u201d pronouns, said that \u201cas far as I understand from the indictment,\u201d the charge is related to an interview they conducted with anti-war Russian blogger Yuri Dud, which was published on YouTube. \u201cIn the interview, I discuss the actions of the Russian Armed Forces in the spring of 2022 in Bucha, Irpin, and other settlements in Ukraine. My statements are based on data collected during my journalistic work,\u201d Gessen said, highlighting a series of interviews they conducted in Bucha, Irpin, Kyiv, and Kryvyi Rih in 2022, as well as their previous journalistic work in Chechnya. \u201cBased on this work, I believe that Russian military personnel committed a number of war crimes in Bucha, Irpin, and other settlements of Ukraine, namely: murder of civilians, illegal detentions, torture, and looting.\u201d \u201cMany years of experience in other conflict zones allow me to say that these actions are not exceptional but, on the contrary, quite typical for Russian military personnel,\u201d Gessen added. \u201cThis is exactly what was discussed in the interview with Yuri Dud.\u201d The YouTube interview has been viewed more than\u00a06.6 million times\u00a0since its release in September 2022. The International Criminal Court (ICC), as well as a number of Western states and international institutions, have accused Russia of war crimes during its ongoing war in Ukraine. In March, the ICC charged two high-ranking Russian officials with directing attacks at civilians, causing excessive harm to civilians, and the crime against humanity of inhumane acts. While the Russian military has conducted its invasion, the Kremlin has sought to stifle criticism of its strategy at home. A number of prominent anti-war figures have been sentenced and convicted since February 2022, under vague new laws that punish what the Kremlin deems to be fake news about its military. \u201cCriminal prosecution is an attempt to punish me for the conscientious and consistent fulfillment of my professional duties,\u201d Gessen said. \u201cI am outside the Russian Federation, so the so-called court can \u2018consider\u2019 my case, \u2018arrest,\u2019 and \u2018sentence\u2019 me only in absentia. However, I regard the criminal prosecution and putting me on the wanted list as an attempt to intimidate me and prevent me from carrying out my professional activities.\u201d The trial of American journalist\u00a0Evan Gershkovich is meanwhile set to resume Thursday, having been brought forward at the request of the defense, Russia\u2019s Sverdlovsk regional court has said. Gershkovich is the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in\u00a0Russia\u00a0since the Cold War. His trial began last month, with the journalist appearing in the courtroom\u2019s glass cage, his head recently shaved. He was arrested while on a reporting trip for the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) in the city of Yekaterinburg in March 2023 and later accused of spying for the CIA. Gershkovich, the US government, and the WSJ have vehemently denied the charges against him. Within two weeks of his arrest, the US State Department designated him as wrongfully detained and called for his immediate release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/media/masha-gessen-russia-sentencing-ukraine-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2023_11_22_tech_openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk", "text": "In a year of wild tech stories that has seen Elon Musk transform Twitter, cryptocurrency exchange FTX collapse and Silicon Valley Bank implode, this week\u2019s whiplash-inducing turmoil at OpenAI is among the most captivating. Sam Altman \u2014 the leader of one of the world\u2019s most influential AI companies, OpenAI, and perhaps the\u00a0most visible figure in the fledgling industry \u2014 was fired Friday night by the startup\u2019s directors in a surprise move. Less than five days later, he\u2019s back as the company\u2019s CEO, now with a board that is, in theory, more supportive of his vision. The series of extraordinary events unfolded just days after OpenAI held its\u00a0first-ever developer conference, where it laid out new, commercialized versions of its technology, including the option to customize its ChatGPT AI chatbot. If you\u2019re just catching up, here\u2019s what you missed from a week so incredible you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the script could have been written by an early version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Friday Around 3 p.m. ET, Altman joined a Google Meet call with most of OpenAI\u2019s board that had been convened by fellow co-founder and OpenAI chief scientist\u00a0Ilya Sutskever, during which Altman was fired and told that the news would soon be made public. Within the next half hour, the board also informed Greg Brockman, another co-founder and OpenAI president, that he would be removed from the board. Around 3:30 p.m. ET, OpenAI publicly announced that it had fired Altman over concerns that he was not always truthful with the board. The board said Mira Murati, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, would become interim CEO. OpenAI\u2019s strategic partners, including its biggest financial backer Microsoft, were also reportedly informed of Altman\u2019s ouster just minutes before the board\u2019s announcement. Hours after being fired, Altman posted on X that he \u201cloved working with such talented people\u201d and that he would have \u201cmore to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d Brockman promptly quit. \u201cPlease don\u2019t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,\u201d Brockman\u00a0said in a Friday post\u00a0on X. \u201cGreater things coming soon.\u201d A key factor in the CEO\u2019s firing was\u00a0tension between Altman, who favored developing AI\u00a0more aggressively, and members of the OpenAI board, who wanted to move more cautiously,\u00a0according to CNN contributor Kara Swisher,\u00a0who spoke to sources knowledgeable about the unfolding events. Saturday Within 24 hours of Altman being fired, reports emerged that he and other ex-OpenAI loyalists were mulling plans for their own venture. OpenAI\u2019s board was also reportedly having second thoughts and considering asking the ousted CEO to return. Sunday By Sunday afternoon, Altman was\u00a0back at OpenAI\u2019s headquarters\u00a0\u2014 this time with a guest badge \u2014 to negotiate his potential return. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly mediated the discussion. A 5 p.m. PT deadline was reportedly set for the board to agree to Altman\u2019s demands, including adding a seat for Microsoft, and reinstating him as CEO. But those talks broke down. As Sunday turned into Monday, Nadella tweeted that Altman, along with Brockman, would join Microsoft to run a new AI research group. At OpenAI, the group found a new interim CEO: Emmett Shear, the former CEO of Amazon\u2019s streaming service, Twitch. Murati would return to her role as OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer. Monday In a post on X early Monday, Shear, who left his role at Twitch in March, described the chance to join OpenAI as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime\u201d opportunity. He added that the company would hire an independent investigator to report on what happened in the lead-up to Altman\u2019s firing. But OpenAI employees were not convinced. More than 500 staffers signed an open letter calling on the company\u2019s board to resign and reinstate Altman and Brockman. They also threatened to follow the co-founders to Microsoft if their demands were not met. Altman posted on X, saying, \u201cwe have more unity and commitment and focus than ever before. we are all going to work together some way or other, and i\u2019m so excited. one team, one mission.\u201d The drama was far from over.\u00a0The Verge reported Monday afternoon\u00a0that Altman and Brockman could still return to OpenAI if the board members who fired him resign. And Nadella, speaking to CNBC, said he was \u201copen to both options\u201d when asked whether Altman would actually join Microsoft. \u201cLook, that is for the OpenAI board and management and the employees to choose,\u201d Nadella said. \u201cWe chose to explicitly partner with OpenAI and we want to continue to do so, and obviously, that depends on the people of OpenAI staying there or coming to Microsoft.\u201d Tuesday Altman\u00a0was reinstated late Tuesday as OpenAI\u2019s CEO, the company said on X. \u201cWe have reached an agreement in principle for Sam Altman to return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board,\u201d the company said, adding that the board will be chaired by Bret Taylor, a former co-CEO of Salesforce. Former Treasury Secretary\u00a0Larry Summers will also join the board, alongside existing director, Quora CEO\u00a0Adam D\u2019Angelo. \u201cWe are collaborating to figure out the details,\u201d it said. In his own post on X, formerly Twitter, Altman\u00a0wrote\u00a0that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to returning to OpenAI and building on the firm\u2019s \u201cstrong partnership\u201d with Microsoft. It\u2019s unclear how Shear will be affected by Altman\u2019s return.\u00a0Posting on X, Shear wrote:\u00a0\u201cI am deeply pleased by this result, after (some) 72 very intense hours of work \u2026 I\u2019m glad to have been a part of the solution.\u201d Brockman is also returning to OpenAI, according to his\u00a0post on X. Ultimately, Microsoft and Altman appear to be the big winners from the dust-up: Altman will continue leading the firm he helped to found. And Microsoft has wrested more control over the company it has backed with billions to bolster its ambitions in developing AI. \u201cWe are encouraged by the changes to the OpenAI board,\u201d Nadella\u00a0said\u00a0on X. \u201cWe believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/11/22/tech/openai-sam-altman-chaos-explained-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "secret-service-female-agents-backlash-right-media", "text": "The US Secret Service pushed back Thursday against recent criticism from right-wing media personalities and lawmakers blaming female agents for security failures during the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. In the wake of the Saturday shooting, some right-wing media figures focused their attention on the female agents on stage with Trump, claiming they couldn\u2019t properly protect someone bigger and taller than themselves, or that they didn\u2019t act in a professional manner. Edited videos\u00a0that have garnered millions of views\u00a0on social media\u00a0as supposed evidence of female incompetence,\u00a0showed a female Secret Service agent seemingly struggling to holster her gun amid\u00a0the\u00a0chaotic scene as a group of\u00a0agents\u00a0escorted Trump to his motorcade. Law enforcement professionals, including a former Secret Service deputy director, have strenuously pushed back\u00a0on the narrative that has been promoted on Fox News and by billionaire X owner Elon Musk, who has pledged his support for Trump. In a statement Thursday to CNN, the Secret Service blasted misogynist claims that the female agents were incapable of protecting Trump. \u201cIt is an insult to the women of our agency to imply that they are unqualified based on gender. Such baseless assertions undermine the professionalism, dedication and expertise of our workforce,\u201d Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement. \u201cOur commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion ensures that we attract the best talent, fostering a robust and effective team that reflects the society we serve.\u201d Figures on the right, including some members of Congress, have also baselessly claimed that Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle was only appointed to the role because of diversity initiatives. She is the second female Secret Service director in the agency\u2019s history. \u201cWe stand united against any attempt to discredit our personnel and their invaluable contributions to our mission and are appalled by the disparaging and disgusting comments against any of our personnel,\u201d\u00a0Guglielmi said. Associations that represent women in law enforcement have also reacted to the\u00a0unfounded attacks on female agents\u00a0with disappointment and alarm. \u201cStatements blaming this shooting on efforts to promote gender equity are disingenuous at best and deeply dangerous at worst,\u201d a group of associations, including Women in Federal Law Enforcement, International Association of Women Police, and National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives, said in a statement. Research has shown that efforts to expand the pool of qualified applicants for law enforcement positions \u201cmakes us all safer and say they do not advocate for hiring solely based on gender or lowering standards in any way,\u201d they said. \u201cWe must reject all bad-faith efforts to seek to score political points at the expense of our safety. This is the most recent effort to sow division and blame by attacking diversity initiatives for everything from airline safety catastrophes to bridge collapse to bank failures,\u201d the groups said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/secret-service-female-agents-backlash-right-media/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_business_corporate-activism-nightcap", "text": "Corporate America gave social activism a go. Between 2020 and 2023-ish, it really seemed like the big guys were done with the old ways of ignoring societal injustices and keeping their eyes trained squarely on the bottom line. But like most trends, corporate activism moves on a pendulum. And right now, in the (Election) Year of Our Lord 2024, we are firmly on the backswing. Check out some of my colleagues\u2019 headlines in recent days: Bud Light loses more ground, slipping to No. 3 in America John Deere backs away from diversity and inclusion efforts after a conservative backlash Tractor Supply warned climate change and a lack of diversity would hurt business. Now it\u2019s ignoring those risks Target is dialing back on Pride merchandise after right-wing backlash To quote CNN contributor and rockstar journalist Kara Swisher: \u201cAs it turned out, it was capitalism after all.\u201d Let\u2019s back up a bit. There have always been socially conscious companies out there walking the walk. Your Patagonias and Ben & Jerry\u2019s. But in the midst of America\u2019s racial reckoning following the emergence of Black Lives Matter, years of protests and the murder of George Floyd, the idea of \u201cstakeholder capitalism\u201d \u2014 basically, that companies thrive when they focus not merely on chasing profit but also on supporting their employees and customers, and generally not destroying the environment \u2014 was showing up in surprising places. In 2018, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, blew peoples minds when he wrote in his closely watched annual letter that businesses need to not only make money but also make \u201ca positive contribution to society.\u201d The following year, the Business Roundtable, a group of about 200 CEOs, signed a letter\u00a0embracing a similar message. We\u2019d come a long way from the days of Reagan-era \u201cgreed is good.\u201d Some of it was just lip service, of course, and plenty of companies caught flak for trying to look progressive by slapping a rainbow flag on their Twitter profiles. But their hearts seemed to be in the right place. By 2020, the public outcry over Floyd\u2019s murder made it impossible for companies to stick their head in the sand anymore. That\u2019s when Corporate America went full-tilt into diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI. That\u2019s also when the far-right outrage machine started revving up. In 2022, Disney\u2019s then-CEO Bob Chapek stumbled into the discourse over Florida\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill, pitting Florida\u2019s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis against one of the state\u2019s biggest employers in a saga that ultimately cost Chapek his job. It became cautionary tale for other CEOs: Support the LGBTQ community, of course. But tread lightly if you want to keep your job. Then came the Bud Light fiasco of 2023. In short: The brand did a one-off partnership with the transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. Then a bunch of anti-trans people called for a boycott. And sales of Bud Light have taken a hit ever since. It went from the No. 1 to No. 3 beer in America. Bud Light didn\u2019t handle fallout well \u2014 it capitulated to the angry mob and dropped Mulvaney even as she faced a barrage of threats. But we now know the \u201cbacklash\u201d was a lot more than just a handful of anti-trans jerks swearing off their favorite beer and posting about it on TikTok. It caught fire as right-wing media fueled the swirl of negativity around Bud Light, framing it as \u201cwokeism\u201d gone amok. On Thursday, the Guardian reported that the Bud Light boycott was fueled in part by the right-wing activist Leonard Leo. Citing tax documents uncovered by the watchdog group Accountable.US, the British paper wrote that a group connected to Leo led a backlash effort \u201cthat generated threats against Mulvaney, violence against consumers and layoffs by Anheuser-Busch,\u201d the Guardian wrote. (Leo declined to comment to the Guardian. CNN has reached out to Leo through the Federalist Society, the conservative legal group he co-chairs.) Bottom line: It is, of course, the nature of people and systems to revert to muscle memory. Corporate America has spent a lot more time chasing profit than it has effecting cultural change, and we can\u2019t expect corporations to fix everything. It was easier for companies to stick their necks out in 2020 and 2021, when interest rates were near zero and customers were still loading up on goods faster than the supply chain could handle. But the blowback from the right, combined with higher interest rates and less ravenous consumer spending, has been enough to push major brands back to the sidelines. It is capitalism, after all.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/business/corporate-activism-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "business"}}
